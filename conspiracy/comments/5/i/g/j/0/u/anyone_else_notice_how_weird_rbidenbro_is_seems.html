        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">160</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-12-15 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/_apprentice_.html">_apprentice_</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I noticed this a few weeks ago, but kept it to myself. </p>

<p><a href="/r/bidenbro">/r/bidenbro</a> is filled with super cheesy and (imo) totally unfunny memes about Joe Biden. I thought it was a super dumb subreddit that wasn&#39;t going to last. However, with all the Reddit manipulation that has been going on I started to think this can&#39;t just be users suddenly deciding that Joe Biden was cool and that they&#39;re going to make him a meme. </p>

<p>Anyone who has been on Reddit for at least a year or two knows how well the hivemind of Reddit was against Joe Biden. The super creepy gif of him grabbing that young girl as he whispered in his ear was even semi viral for a while. I know for a fact the overall view of him for a good amount of time was creepy and negative. Yet, all of a sudden it changed...</p>

<p>I ignored it for a while and downvoted most of the posts I saw from them because I personally find the memes unfunny and like they&#39;re trying way too hard. Then one day <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/bidenbro/comments/5gsxsw/what_the_electoral_map_will_look_like_in_2020/">this post</a> surfaced near the top of <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>. </p>

<p>Yes, this is a conspiracy theory. Maybe all of a sudden Reddit users decided to start liking Joe Biden for lord knows what reasons. Maybe I&#39;m out of touch with what&#39;s &quot;in&quot; and Joe Biden really is a super awesome cat to meme out.</p>

<p>I wanted to share this observation I made because to me something does not feel right about this. Hopefully, I&#39;m not the only one. Either way, we must keep our eyes out for this possibility that &quot;Left Groups&quot; are trying to join the &quot;meme war&quot; by propping up someone they can control through &quot;Meme Propaganda.&quot; Maybe they heard Trump won because of memes and are trying to hop on the bandwagon early to meme someone that will continue their agenda in the future.</p>

<p>Perhaps, I had a weird feeling about <a href="/r/bidenbro">/r/bidenbro</a> because it feels like when parents, teachers, or older relative try to be cool and hip. Yeah, it&#39;s cute and they kinda get it, but you just know when a meme is just right versus plain awkward.</p>

<p>Please let me know your thoughts and feel free to debate my observation. Free speech is king after all.</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/bidenbro/comments/5gsxsw/what_the_electoral_map_will_look_like_in_2020/">https://np.reddit.com/r/bidenbro/comments/5gsxsw/what_the_electoral_map_will_look_like_in_2020/</a></p>

<p>EDIT: Read almost everybody&#39;s great replies and contributions. I&#39;d say overall most people have taken note of what&#39;s going on too. I went back to bidenbro to take a look at memes and their front page. So much corny lame memes. Not even funny. Stumbled on other weird foreshadowing memes. And even one that&#39;s not even a meme. Just a news article with Biden hinting he might be running for President in 2020. He&#39;s close to Obama so let&#39;s assume he&#39;s in the corrupt circle of controlled politicians. He would be their first choice because he&#39;s a trusted insider. The establishment already knows Clinton has no way of winning. Which is why she was so hurt by her loss. She knew there was no chance she could ever be president again.</p>

<p>Do you mean Donald Trump used r/The_Donald to hype himself up? Or do you mean just the r/The_Donald users through their own discretion used memes to hype Trump up in general?</p>

<p>I distinguish between:</p>

<ul>
<li>an organic portion of the Reddit user base pushes an agenda</li>
<li>an organic portion of the Reddit user base is organized by an official political authority to push an agenda</li>
<li>an inorganic portion of the Reddit user base is pushing an agenda</li>
</ul>

<p>The final option is a &quot;conspiracy&quot; that I do not believe should be permitted. r/HillaryClinton, for example, is clearly the last option. I believe r/The_Donald and r/Sanders4President were either options 1 or 2. r/BidenBro, atm, I am unsure whether is 2 or 3.</p>

<p>Biden has nothing to do with PizzaGate. The people memeing about Biden have literally zero to do with that.</p>

<p>And Biden does this how?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Out of all the possible people we can meme you think the reddit normal user base decided to start meming Biden for no reason?</p>

<p>It occured right around election time when nostalgic feelings about the obama era are coming up from the kids who lived through it. This site isn&#39;t just made up of jaded 30 year olds.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On average reddit never liked Joe Biden.
By what measure can you even base that?</p>

<p>Anyone here over a year or two knows this. 
I have been here for 5 and I honestly can&#39;t recall a time anyone talking about Biden besides comments about him being close to people. I would argue most people are neutral about Biden.</p>

<p>large possible manipulation known as bidenbro.
Why does Trump get off the hook for  manipulation when T_D appears all the fucking time?</p>

<p>What does the establishment get from people meming about Biden? Absolutely zero</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know. Well kind of. He&#39;s part of the corrupt establishment.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not understanding. I&#39;m saying the establishment that has taken over reddit is using the corny subreddit to make Biden into a cool cat that everyone likes so that later on they can prop him up to run for something. Well... trying.</p>

<p>It occurred after the election. After they witnessed the power of meme magic.</p>

<p>You&#39;re still not following! The establishment IS the one creating the MEMES. Sure some sheep follow along and try to get karma memeing Biden, but this was started by the establishment trying to make Biden look cool thinking they can use the meme magic Trump profited from. They think they can meme the fuck out of biden, make him look cool, so that in the future (once they have accomplished their mission of making him look like a cool memed out cat) they can prop him up in some elected position. Or make him a spokesperson or some kind of leader in some situation that will push their agenda further forward.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget this is a conspiracy theory. We are in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>However, bidenbro is really really weird to me. So I wanted to share and see if anyone else felt the same. Seems to me most people do. Glad I&#39;m not the only one.</p>

<p>Same with CTR and corporate influence. They&#39;re controlled by the same establishment. I&#39;m sure they still have shills on Reddit. They took note how obvious it was and scaled down on shills to make it less obvious.</p>

<p>EDIT: My wording might sound CTR and ISIS are controlled by the same establishment. That&#39;s not what I meant. I mean CTR and other paid shills from the establishment&#39;s agenda are controlled by the same overall hivemind.</p>

For those of you who think maybe 2020 will be an establishment election... I&#39;m not so sure. With all this fallout from the election, &quot;fake news&quot; and the media tightening their grip on the narrative, I think more and more people are seeing this as a system that does not work for them. </p>

<p>You can see this for yourself <a href="http://www.theonion.com/search?q=joe+biden">http://www.theonion.com/search?q=joe+biden</a></p>

<p>And if you don&#39;t want to click, here is a small sampling of the articles they&#39;ve written</p>

<ul>
<li>Joe Biden Shows Up To Inauguration With Ponytail</li>
<li>Biden Criticized For Appearing In Hennessy Ads</li>
<li>Biden To Honor Fallen Soldiers By Jumping Motorcycle Over Vietnam Memorial</li>
<li>Biden Has Guy Named Worm Sit In For Him At Cabinet Meeting</li>
<li>Biden Donates Collection Of Classic Skin Mags To Those In Need During Holidays</li>

<p>I will say this though; even before these elections started the overall feel towards Biden on reddit was not positive. It&#39;s changed all of a sudden. And the way they&#39;re trying to portray him and hype him up seems like they&#39;re propping him up for something in the future...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m definitely bias. Obviously from my experience since 2010 on Reddit I can tell you from my general experience people did not like Biden on here.</p>

<p>My opinion is definitely bias even more so because I believe that Reddit has been compromised. The take over started happening around 2014 or 2015 and got blatantly worse this year. I always felt something was weird and changing with Reddit and so did my close friends. 2016 just brought everything more to light.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re also missing the point. Trump was running for president and had no presence on reddit before this election. BidenBro is out of NOWHERE and for no real reason. He&#39;s not running for anything. It&#39;s like they&#39;re trying to hype him up now for something in the coming future... </p>

<p>Also, if you&#39;ve been around reddit for 1-2 years you know on average the reddit hivemind has always been against joe biden. Now all of a sudden it&#39;s changed...</p>

<p>Just a meme? It&#39;s just a news article. It&#39;s just a reddit post. No.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>An exaggerated meme about Biden, a political figure in the highest area of American governments is completely irrelevant to politics to you? Clearly in any political scenario it is safe for a logical person to assume and clearly see Propaganda in such a subreddit. Wether on purpose and paid by a higher power, or by a close group of opinionated mods, (or high schoolers being silly and accidentally contributing) there is a propaganda that exists. That is a fact.</p>

<p>What is sounds you&#39;re trying to say to me is that you believe this is absolutely a ridiculous idea. Obviously it must just be redditors posting silly memes coincidentally about a person very high parts of our government ESPECIALLY on the democratic side which in recent events have been proven to be highly controlled by foreign interests. If you don&#39;t know about these facts by now then I shouldn&#39;t continue.</p>

<p>Secondly, a fake persona people give him for and IN the meme is perfectly relevant. If we assume this (globalist agenda pushers aka the left) truly is going on since this is indeed a conspiracy theory, then the end of goal of the creator of the subreddit would be to connect people psychologically from BIDEN to positive feelings. </p>

<p>Then again there&#39;s also the chance it&#39;s just a silly subreddit. All just coincidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People posting memes of a likeable politician is not a conspiracy.  The same way people posting memes of Trump as an off shoot of his online popularity has been achieved through organic means.  Shockingly, many liberal voters identify with Biden as a down to earth guy and not as (gasp) a filthy pedophile using memes to ingratiate himself into the white house.  Biden most likely has no interest in running in 2020 anyways.  He&#39;ll be too old and his political time has passed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with he probably is too old and his political time has passed... or has it...?</p>

<p>But the truth is Biden has not been a likeable politician at least in the reddit hivemind. If you follow reddit closely like I have since 2011 you can see a lot of negativity toward biden started around 2013/2014. The overall feel towards Biden was negative. It&#39;s funny how all of a sudden it changed.</p>
