        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>That demon’s name? Moloch, the Caananite god-demon of child sacrifice. However, to understand the role of Moloch in all of this (some people whom literally believe the deity to be the harbinger of the end of days in the Book of Revelations), we need to take a step back – all the way back to the Old Testament, to “Yahweh”, or as the <a href="http://i.imgur.com/ZnlJt.jpg">freemasons</a> refer to it, the <strong>Jah</strong> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jahbulon#Examples_of_interpretations_of_the_word_based_on_its_syllables">“Jah-bal-on”</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Bal</strong> refers to the Ancient Egyptian-&gt;Phoenician-&gt;Carthaginian-&gt;Babylonian-&gt;Assyrian God “Ba’al”, and <strong>On</strong> refers to the Ancient Egyptian city of Heliopolis (via Grecian translation). </p>

<p>Jahbalon is the ritualistic word spoken in Freemasonry to resemble the name of the multiple historical Gods. </p>

<p>The problem, however, is that their holy war has sort of spilled out into our arena, and we’re stuck dealing with the mess. Now I&#39;ve seen various posts and threads on this site (and others) all proclaiming to know what&#39;s going on - with outlandish theories based in New Age Occultism designed to explain away everything from Pizzagate to Cathy O&#39;Brien to Bohemian Grove, but the answer is far, far more simple: </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOwbSfAtazc#t=1m17s">What I am about to tell you sounds crazy. But you have to listen to me. Your very lives depend on it</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osiris_myth">According to the most important myth in all of ancient Egypt</a>, Osiris captured and killed his brother Set in a dispute. But this was only because Set killed Osiris <em>first</em>, leading to Osiris being resurrected by his wife Isis. This myth essentially repeats the killing of each brother ad infinitum, but the point is that Osiris is considered a &quot;good&quot; god (ruler of the dead, which Egyptians considered the blessed &quot;living&quot;), while Set is considered a &quot;bad&quot; god. This duality was used to explain away all sorts of phenomena in the Ancient Egyptian kingdoms.  </p>

<p>Set also happens to be the basis for the satanic cult <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Set">The Temple of Set</a>, the head of whom, was <a href="http://forums.militarytimes.com/archive/index.php/t-7259.html">Michael Acquino</a>, a Lieutenant Colonel in INSCOM, the U.S. Army Intelligence &amp; Security Command (holy crap, this guy is former Psyops for the military). </p>

<p><a href="https://xeper.org/maquino/">Here&#39;s his personal website</a>. </p>

<p>Michael was implicated and acquitted <a href="http://beforeitsnews.com/opinion/2014/10/the-case-against-general-michael-aquino-satanic-pedophile-2451124.html">in a pedophilia scandal of his own</a>. The Temple of Set was founded as an offshoot of <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/the-witch/satanism-anton-lavey-hollywood/">Anton LeVay&#39;s Church of Satan, which also maintained odd sex rituals, as &quot;there were still, according to the accounts of former members, orgies and services of a sexual nature&quot;</a>.</p>

<p>See, if you apparently disguise your bad behavior as “occult magick”, the US Government leaves you alone. There is an extreme tolerance of “religious practices” (or lack thereof, depending on what cultists claim) and it manifests itself in horrible ways. Regarding pederasty and underground pedophilia sex rings, these cults <a href="http://www.icsahome.com/articles/religious-justifications-for-child-sexual-abuse-in-cults-kent-ijcs-2012">“provide examples of how pedophiles and/or ephebophiles can concoct religiously based theologies as means both to draw victims into their influence and provide explanations of their behaviour to their young prey”</a>. </p>

<p>While one could say that freemasonry is satanic and comprised of practitioners of the occult (and many, many conspiracy websites do, despite this literally being the Taxil Hoax), a simpler answer exists - <a href="http://www.masonicinfo.com/fakemasonry.htm">there are good lodges, considered official, and bad lodges, considered unofficial</a>. </p>

<p>The freemasons, in addition to literally being the world’s first trade union, “free” to charge whatever they wanted for their masonry skills, protected their secrets of science (physics, geometry, math) initially through rituals. Much of their spirituality, however, is owed to the Judeo/Christian-Ba’al foundational split, with the general consensus stating that the secret society is based on the work of the “[free] masons” who originally built <a href="http://www.lodgechelmsford.com/">King Solomon’s Temple</a>, as well as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_Templar">the founding dogma of the Knight’s Templar</a> – which existed during a time that they could not. Back then, a god or series of gods was used to clarify scientific phenomena otherwise (at that time) unexplainable. However, Freemasonry transcends religiosity (as it had to become so much more for the knowledge to survive), while the Knight’s Templar (also known as the Order of Solomon’s Temple) reveled in it (however, they too were disbanded by royal decree in 1312). </p>

<p>While there is disparity on what constitutes an official lodge versus an unofficial lodge (namely, that certain lodges have schisms within the secret society and thus refuse to recognize each other), the ultimate basis for a legitimate lodge is that of “purity”. Purity of the members. Purity of their children (literally and symbolically, as they are the next generation). </p>

<p>Official lodges, for example, participate in the Shriner’s Communities, which sponsors free medical aid for children’s hospitals. In some cases, they <em>own</em> the hospitals. The children of Freemasons can even enter into their own order, and many ultimately join Freemasonry when they’re old enough (although it’s not mandatory).  </p>

<p>The unofficial lodges however, as aforementioned, do not see children as pure in their own right, but as a means of purification unto their own membership. A selfish act designed to eek away the corruption individually within, to appease a higher power (or so they legitimately believe). A throwback to the child sacrifice rituals demanded to appease Caananite Gods. </p>

<p>The very opposite of the Freemason credo to <a href="http://www.mqmagazine.co.uk/issue-13/p-46.php">“be a law-abiding subject, and to the practice of ‘every domestic as well as public virtue’”</a>. </p>

<p>So how do the origins of freemason’s “Jah-Bal-On” relate to [CURRENT YEAR]? Well, pizza parties stem from the globalist belief in the occult, from within the unofficial lodges. </p>

<p><strong>Jah:</strong></p>

<p>Ritualized child Sacrifice was initially practiced by the Pheonicians and Caananites (among others) <a href="http://www.academia.edu/7705209/D._D._Hughes_Human_Sacrifice_in_Ancient_Greece_London_1991_">as a means of satiating the God(s) of fertility and vegetation - Baal.</a>. It literally made their world go &#39;round, before a monotheistic Creator came on the religious scene.</p>

<p>Upon the switch from monolatry (worship of one idol at the expense of all others) to monotheism (worshiping one Creator at the expense of all others) Judaism redefined child sacrifice as a symbolic, metaphysical ritual. For example, in the Pentateuch, or Old Testament, child sacrifice is written as a metaphor for apostasy (considered the ultimate sin in Judaism): </p>

<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21</a> &quot;And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through the fire to Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am the LORD.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-2.htm">Leviticus 20:2</a>: &quot;Again, thou shalt say to the children of Israel, Whosoever he be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that giveth any of his seed unto Molech; he shall surely be put to death: the people of the land shall stone him with stones.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/30-3.htm">Leviticus 20:3</a>: &quot;And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-9.htm">Deuteronomy 18:9-11</a>: &quot;&quot;When you enter the land which the LORD your God gives you, you shall not learn to imitate the detestable things of those nations. There shall not be found among you anyone who makes his son or his daughter pass through the fire, one who uses divination, one who practices witchcraft, or one who interprets omens, or a sorcerer, or one who casts a spell, or a medium, or a spiritist, or one who calls up the dead.&quot;</p>

<p>So how do we know child sacrifice is symbolic in Judaism but literal in Canaanite theology? The brazen bull, presented as a gift to Phalaris of Akragas, Sicily from Perillos of Athens.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PToapr_EuEE">The brazen bull (NSFL)</a>, for those unawares, <a href="http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA254014762&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=txshracd2488&amp;it=r&amp;p=AONE&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=c07edf30e2f808cd34fc8a61749329f2">is a torture device designed to roast the unfortunate child sacrifice alive - their screams drowned out by either sacrificial drum-beating, or depending on the sophistication of the actual bull, a series of pipes designed to alter the screams into the bellows of a bull</a>.  </p>

<p>The practice of burning children in Topheth was ended by Josiah, King of Judah, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-10.htm">who “defiled Topheth” as part of his great religious reforms</a>. <a href="http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/157006300x00107">Akragas also had Carthaginian roots</a>, which will be discussed more under <strong>&quot;Bal:&quot;</strong> due to the reverence of Carthaginian deity Baal-Haamon.</p>

<p>In Judaism, however, the concept became metaphorical, elucidated by the story of Abraham and the attempted sacrifice of his son Isaac on the orders of Yahweh, wherein a request for a sacrifice became a religious test of a subject&#39;s free will.  </p>

<p>In the dating of the origins of Freemasonry, rituals commonly hold that the secret society spiritually owes its existence initially as a continuance of Judaic beliefs – gone underground due to the rise in Roman anti-Zionism (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Kingdom">started in the 6th Century BC</a>). 
In fact, Judaism as a religion goes back to the 1st millennium BC, under the Kingdom of Israel/Judah! </p>

<p>However, while there was an eventual endorsement of Christianity (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocletianic_Persecution#The_Peace_of_Galerius_and_the_Edict_of_Milan.2C_311.E2.80.93313">The Edict of Milan</a>) by Constantine I <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_the_Great_and_Christianity">in the 3rd century AD</a>, the Church became oppressive after the fall of the Roman Empire – leading to the Dark Ages, a time when all academic thought counter to the Church was stifled. </p>

<p>Indeed, including the later appropriation of Ba’al (or its Medieval resurrection in that case), the earliest Masonic text dates to 1425 (under the Halliwell Manuscript/Regius Poem, the earliest of the Old Charges), and describes events occurring in the early 9th century AD, just before the rise of the Italian Renaissance. At this point, Freemasonry has become a Judeo-Christian stronghold against the religious oppression, carrying the morals for both religions.</p>

<p><strong>Bal:</strong></p>

<p>The “Bal” in “Jahbalon” refers to “Baal” – the Caananite God of the Phoenicians, its status akin to the Judeo-Christian “Yahweh”. <strong>It is arguably the flipside to the coin regarding “Jah”, one where child sacrifices are considered literal in order to successfully pass from the world of the living to the world of the dead</strong>. </p>

<p>I think it is important to note a distinction regarding Old and New Age Occultism. Old Age Occultism refers to the ancient worship of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baal_Hammon">Baal-Haamon</a>, and Moloch. New Age Occultism refers to the co-opting of Old Age Occultism in a effort to make sense of the ancient cultural rites before any proper methodology for dissemination was discovered. </p>

<p>A great example of this is the existence of Sargon of Akkad. Current theological discussion posits that Sargon of Akkad is the original owner of the &quot;baby-sent-through-the-reeds-by-the-high-priestess-mother-in-a-basket&quot; story, the same that appears of Moses&#39;s origin story. However, Sargon of Akkad&#39;s documented upbringing is New Age Occultism, <a href="https://books.google.ca/books?id=izhhWQEJkrQC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">as the documents that &quot;discovered&quot; the story were found in 1850, and dated to the 7 - 8th century BC</a>. However, the story of Moses originates in the Book of Exodus, dated to the 5 - 6th century BC, <em>and founded in the 400 BC at the latest, and 800 BC at the earliest</em>. Making the Sargon of Akkad story nothing more than revisionist history.  </p>

<p>The earliest mention of a “Jewish” homeland indeed comes with the Kingdom of Israel, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Israel_(Samaria">in the 10th Century BC</a>#Kingdom_of_Judah), until it was conquered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Assyrian_Empire">in 720 BC in the neo-Assyrian Period</a>. </p>

<p>Jews were expelled <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-14.htm">to Babylonian captivity in Egypt</a>, and the first Temple of Solomon was destroyed. Later, in 597 BC, Nebuchadnezzar II of the neo-Babylonian Empire (previously of the Assyrian Empire) invades Judah (which remained a separate city despite the original takeover), and conquers Jerusalem. </p>

<p>Within the neo-Babylonian Empire, <a href="http://www.bibleodyssey.org/en/places/related-articles/sanctuaries-at-dan-and-bethel.aspx">there is equal worship towards</a> both <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-31.htm">Baal and Yahweh</a>. However, worship of Baal is also established outside the Old Testament with the historical record supporting the existence of the marriage of King Ahab to the daughter of the ruler of the Phoenician empire, Jezebel. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahab">Their union being a sign of the power and prestige of Ahab and the northern Kingdom of Israel</a>, Jezebel (in)famously convinced her husband to abandon worship in Yahweh and convert to the altar of Baal. </p>

<p>Onwards, in 539 BC, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaemenid_Assyria">the Achaemenid Assyrian empire conquers the neo-Babylonian Empire</a>, and in an effort to assert himself as the rightful ruler over the resulting empire, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonia#Neo-Babylonian_Empire_.28Chaldean_Era.29">Cyrus the Great not only allows Jews to return from Babylonian exile, but to bring their gods along with them</a>. This enabled Cyrus (the Achaemenid Persian &quot;king of Anshan&quot; in Elam) to assert himself as the avenger of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marduk">Marduk, the primary Babylonian God</a>, and act as official oversight to both Yahweh, the primary Jewish god, and Ba’al, the primary Caananite God. </p>

<p>Interestingly, this is the spiritual birthplace of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabbalah">Jewish mysticism&#39;s Kabbalah movement</a>, as some Jews during the Babylonian exile began to blend Old Testament beliefs with Babylonian myths and mysticism! </p>

<h1>Their version of the <a href="http://www.kabbalahandhealing.com/images/photo.treeoflifeyellow.big.jpg">Tree of Life, or the 10 Sephirot</a>, is heavily featured in <a href="http://tracytwyman.com/comet-ping-pong-artist-and-victim-embeds-pizza-cry-for-help-in-kaballistic-image/">Kim Noble&#39;s artwork that adorns the walls of Comet Ping Pong</a>!</h1>

<p>While Baal may have started out as an innocuous deity worshipped by an ancient civilization, in the 18th century AD it took on a new status by Christians illiterate to the ways of the Old Testament – that of demon-worship, or the occult, <em>within</em> sectarian Christianity, as the lord of the underworld, the prince of Hell. In the New Testament, Baal is referred to as Satan. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Moloch_the_god.gif">While it initially was described as a man or a bull</a>, the 18th century co-opt was later described it as <em>both</em> - the man referring to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baal_Hammon">Ba’al Haamon</a>, King of the Gods from the Pheonician colony of Carthage; the bull referring to [Moloch and the signifying act of child sacrifice as a means of fertility within their culture](<a href="http://www.law2.byu.edu/anelaws/alcove/blawbib.pdf">www.law2.byu.edu/anelaws/alcove/blawbib.pdf</a>). </p>

<p>When societies conquer each other, their idols become conflated. This is due to the transmission of cultural ideals between regimes. Therefore, due to the conflation of two separate deities, as they are now referred to by the flipside of the freemasonry, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moloch">Baal is Moloch, and Moloch is Baal</a>! </p>

<p>This is what the Globalists believe. When the DNC staffers profess adulation for Moloch, they literally mean Ba’al. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism_and_occultism">When Hitler expresses a love for the occult</a>, it&#39;s because he believes it&#39;s real. <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/794450623404113920/photo/1">When Wikileaks is warning us of Marina Abramović&#39;s spirit cooking</a>, it&#39;s because she literally believes in it. </p>

<h1><a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/30489">“With fingers crossed, the old rabbit&#39;s foot out of the box in the attic, I will be sacrificing a chicken in the backyard to Moloch...”</a></h1>

<p>As an evidentiary side-note, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pzp6VR7zJ8">Sex slave victim Cathy O’Brien</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugx64jiqkaE#t=10m4s">literally had the face of “Baal” carved into her vagina – <strong>NSFL</strong></a> to appease <a href="https://plus.google.com/117314044592323063284/posts/Zu66JXG9CPU">Robert Byrd – who referred to her as “his little witch”</a>. </p>

<p>And as <a href="/u/Beneficial1">/u/Beneficial1</a> writes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In fact, comets have been observed for far longer in history. The ancient Greeks called them &quot;evil stars,&quot; which in Greek is dys evil and astron a star. This is the origin of the modern word disaster. The association of comets with untoward events or prophecies continued as recently as the twentieth century, when Comet Halley made an unusually close rendezvous with earth.[9]</p>

<p>Ties in perfectly with the whole Alefantis is a Witch idea:</p>

<p>He has an <a href="http://i3.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/021/666/image31.png">Authentic Israel Regardie Baphomet (a mistransliteration of Banebdjedet, an Ancient Egyptian ram god) symbolism on his sign</a> and Comet means Evil Star. And Of course Baphomet is the fallen star. </p>
</blockquote>

<h1>And why does <a href="https://twitter.com/BrittPettibone/status/806254292952707073">James Alefantis seem happy to be compared to Pan, the pagan god of sexual perversion, pedophilia and rape</a>?</h1>

<p>The Pan association is even more interesting, being the figurehead of New Age Occultism&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Paganism">&quot;Neo-Pagan Movement&quot;</a>, in addition to yet <em>another</em> deity of fertility and nature (like Moloch and Baal/Haamon before it), as an archetype of male virility and sexuality. <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=Medieval+depictions+of+Satan!&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiwk9Sprv_QAhXIy4MKHYBUDQkQ_AUICCgB&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=659">Additionally, Pan&#39;s goat-like appearance is even considered a representation of Medieval depictions of Satan</a>!</p>

<h1>For that matter, celebrities have an interesting connection with this New Age Occultism, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eugnrk8Nfi0">James Franco</a>, <a href="http://www.revolvermag.com/sites/default/files/public/styles/article_gallery_slider/public/600full-sammy-davis-jr.jpg?itok=DtRpeKk9">Sammy Davis Jr.</a>, <a href="http://stopmensonges.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/GBgRSzN.jpg">Will Ferrel</a>, <a href="https://ip.bitcointalk.org/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FH31lrmH.jpg&amp;t=571&amp;c=MwU_2NKHf5HTow">Pamela Anderson</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgIi-g5vNK8">Jay-Z</a> etc...</h1>

<p>So now that we know about the intertwined histories of freemasonry, judeo-christianity, and occult gods, how does this relate to us? <a href="http://www.space.com/33878-rare-venus-jupiter-conjunction-tonight.html">Note how Alefantis is linked to solar cults</a>. Ancient Egypt pioneered that shit… </p>

<p><strong>On:</strong></p>

<p>[“On” academically refers to the Egyptian “City of the Sun”, via a Greek transliteration of Heliopolis] - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliopolis_(ancient_Egypt)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliopolis_(ancient_Egypt)</a>. </p>

<p>It’s reverence in Ancient Egypt is akin to Mount Olympus – if you replace Amun/Ra with Zeus. Amun being the God of the Evening Sun, and Ra being the God of the Midday Sun, the combination of which as an omniscient god, but only as a composite deity. Incidentally, Amun/Ra was considered the first self-made deity, <a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/154978105/Gods-and-Goddesses-of-Ancient-Egypt">which the Egyptians described through the metaphor of masturbation</a>. </p>

<p>The hieroglyphs of which were used mainly by the priests, and considered “God’s word” – thus falling into the same relevancy as the Old and New Testament (rather than, say, documented wheat orders from an Ancient Sumarian merchant).</p>

<p>Atum/Ra is the head God of the Ennead, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ennead">which is sort of like Marvel’s Avengers</a> – one member of whom was Osiris. While Scholars believe that “On” dually refers to both the city of On as well as the figurehead of Osiris being the King of the Dead (or as Ancient Egyptians refer to him, the King of the <em>truly</em> “Living”), this is a misinterpretation, [as “On” actually refers to the <em>Ogdoad</em> members, the primordial deities of On <a href="https://books.google.ca/books?id=jSCKAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA286&amp;lpg=PA286&amp;dq=kekuit&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6kWw7RrkWX&amp;sig=930rL1yhWzYybCeWdga1wvd3be4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj41_qivvrQAhVN22MKHfrgCbQQ6AEILDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=kekuit&amp;f=false">(rather than their metaphysical creators)</a> - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogdoad_(Egyptian):">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogdoad_(Egyptian):</a></p>

<p>The names of Kekui and Kekuit are written with a determiner combining the sky hieroglyph with a staff or scepter used for words related to darkness and obscurity, and kkw as a regular word means &quot;darkness&quot;, suggesting that these gods represent primordial darkness, comparable to Greek Erebus, but in some aspects they appear to represent day as well as night, or the <em>change</em> from night to day and from day to night.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More importantly, kek seemingly has the ability to change, for the flipside between the light and the dark, between “Jah” and “Bal”. </p>

<p>According to Egyptologists <a href="http://i3.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/016/151/tumblr_inline_n327sfUDU01r3x7o0.jpg">Jan and Aleida Assmann</a>, their theory of cultural and communicative memory explains Kek quite well. </p>

<p>While Aleida refers to cultural memory regarding the post-war Germans (which incidentally is interesting because Hitler was a huge fan of the Occult), Jan believes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhenaten#Akhenaten_and_Judeo-Christian-Islamic_monotheism">that monotheism broke from earlier cosmotheism, first with Atenism and later with the Exodus from Egypt of the Israelites</a>. </p>

<p>While everything thus far lends credibility to this circumstantial theory, this is a theory for another post, as it would implicate Jews as having been in Egypt during the Exodus – <a href="http://www.worldtribune.com/muslims-acknowledged-jewish-link-to-jerusalem-centuries-ago/">which archeological data is inconclusive on</a> - however what remains is that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhenaten">Pharoah Akhenaten’s reign was considered illegitimate by his numerous successors</a>, and what could be more blasphemous than desecrating the sacrosanct pantheistic religious ideals that founded one’s society? </p>

<p>He’s also partly wrong, as Atenism wasn’t the first example of monotheism (Judaism was), it was the first example of monolatry (or “one idol worship”). </p>

<p>Referring to the theory of Kek and the theory of cultural and communicative memory, however, <a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:7BYQ3PtqwOwJ:archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/propylaeumdok/1774/1/Assmann_Communicative_and_cultural_memory_2008.pdf+&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=ca">here’s what Jan had to say</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cultural memory is a kind of institution. It is exteriorized, objectified, and stored away in symbolic forms that, unlike the sounds of words or the sight of gestures, are stable and situation-transcendent: They may be trans¬ferred from one situation to another and transmitted from one generation to another. External objects as carriers of memory play a role already on the level of personal memory. Our memory, which we possess as beings equipped with a human mind, exists only in constant interaction not only with other human memories but also with &quot;things,&quot; outward symbols.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically, he’s saying that by our actions <a href="http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/077/607/d0e.png">in memeing the shit out of Pepe, we’ve created our own collective memory</a>. We’ve basically taken the <a href="/r/MandelaEffect">/r/MandelaEffect</a> to a whole new level, but instead of ignoring such coincidences as we would have previously, now we’re actively paying attention to them, <em>and using them to alter our perception of people, places, things, and cultures</em>. </p>

<p>The thing is, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_magic">Occultists believe the <em>same</em> thing</a> – their “magick” as a means of redirecting “dark energy” to affect their victims. Child sacrifice and pederasty as a means of appeasing Moloch would easily be a sign of that. Judeo-Christian worshippers believe the <em>same</em> thing, in going to Sunday Church and praying. Even the Chinese call it &quot;Qing&quot; - the life force. It is a concept valued by every culture on Earth, and it&#39;s not that it&#39;s real, but the beliefs in it (and thus the resulting actions from it) definitely are.  </p>

<p>For example, Manly P. Hall, member of the Freemasons (presiding over an unofficial lodge) alludes to this <a href="http://www.manlyphall.org/text/the-lost-keys-of-freemasonry/chapter-iv-the-fellow-craft/">when he states, in <em>The Lost Keys of Freemasonry</em></a> &quot;The seething energies of Lucifer are in his hands, and before he may step onward and upward, he must prove his ability to properly apply energy&quot;. </p>

<p>And that is why “Jah-Bal-On” is so dangerous in the wrong hands (and why The Secret was so financially successful), if people are unaware of the connection.  </p>

<p>The unofficial lodges of Freemasonry, the lodges that <em>pretend</em> to be Freemasonry (like the Illuminati), the cults (like the Temple of Set, the Church of Satan, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Islam#History">and Islam</a>), those are the epicenters of the globalist cabals. </p>

<p>The enabling of evil such as the Temple of Set, Pizzagate, etc. without a proper understanding of the duality – beyond mere “meme magic” (most of which is just confirmation bias) leads to events like <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/chilling-satanic-human-sacrifice-video-8655022">CERN’s opening event being a Satanistic shit show</a>, it leads to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpKdSvwYsrE">Alex Jones having to film the Bohemian Grove (whose members include Presidents Eisenhower, Nixon and Reagan, the Bush dynasty, as well as Hillary’s husband Bill Clinton)</a>, crazy people acting in crazy ways because they believe in crazy events unfolding. No wonder the freemasons have to be the “keepers of the light” for the betterment of men. </p>

<p>The only reason we’re able to effect reality is because of the wide-ranging grasp of the internet. In one comment post, I can talk to Arnold Schwarzenegger, Alex Jones, Denzel Washington, etc., and if they’re so inclined, they can send me a message back! That’s real influence one couldn’t buy historically. </p>

<p>Now, this doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that you should sign up to be a Freemason (if you don&#39;t want to), but what if means is that you should be aware of what the Globalists believe. <em>This</em> is what they believe! it transcends geopolitical borders, linguistic disparities. Through continuously raising questions and paying attention to news that would otherwise be swept under the rug, we can effect the conversation in our favor. </p>

<p>We literally shitposted a man into the White House. And that’s the power of Kek.</p>

<p><em>ahem</em></p>

<p>The worst part is that there&#39;s no redemption. <strong>This is <em>literally</em> what the Crusades were fought over</strong>. </p>

<p><strong>The Crusades were a series of religious wars</strong> sanctioned by the Latin Church in the medieval period, especially the campaigns in the Eastern Mediterranean <strong>with the aim of capturing Jerusalem and the Holy Land from Islamic rule, to recapture Christian territory and defend Christian pilgrims, in western historiography known as &quot;the Crusades for (the recovery of) the Holy Land&quot;.</strong></p>

<blockquote>

<p>What do you consider objectively unproveable? The links are all there. It&#39;s not New Age Occultism, it&#39;s Ancient Egyptian pantheism idolatry. </p>

<p>Note that I didn&#39;t link any &quot;Aleister Crowley Texts&quot; because I view 18th Century Occultism as a &quot;re-patching&quot; of Ancient Occultism - not the real deal. 21st century occultism is based on what the globalists think Ancient Occultism is. I don&#39;t try to persuade anyone of Occult symbols (like the pentagram or the all-seeing eye) because they&#39;re not relevant nor trustworthy. However, I cover the Comet PingPong sign because an Occultist put it up, and he was referencing the Occult directly. I hope that distinction makes sense. </p>

<p>Please, raise any questions you might have, note if you want me to clarify anything. If you have sources you want me to use, let me know. </p>

<p>This is a common problem with both archaeology and science - we cannot form patterns based on what we know, but by what we can deem repeatable. We can never know everything (the Library of Alexandria was destroyed), but we can always find out <em>just enough</em> to deem it more plausible than not. </p>

<p>And if disproven? No hard feelings. </p>

<p>Which is why I mainly talked about the Old Occult, and briefly rushed through the New Occult (only referencing its existence).

    <div class="md"><p>The cern ceremony was cultural to Switzerland and artistic. Nothing that occultic. Bohemian Grove is another artistic festival. The grove members are allowed to invite two guests, so its not that secretive. Its pretty much a frat for the elite but more intelligent in meaning. Just because it looks weird or confusing doesn&#39;t mean its satanic. A christian perspective is bad to have when exploring this stuff. Christianity has tons of flows and easily to disprove. many lies in the bible. Like the story of moses, they took what was going on at the time ( akhenaten and monothesism) and put their story to it. ( sargon of akkad had a very similar upbringing story as well, thousand years before moses). Im quite busy so i dont have time to point everything out</p>

<p>Good thing I used the Torah then! The book considered unaltered from its original text!</p>

<p>Akhenaten is not monotheism. If you read my post you would have known that. Akhenaten is monolatry - worship of one idol over any other. monotheism is worship of a metaphysical Creator over all other idols. </p>

<p>Sure, so that manuscript was discovered in 1850 AD, purported to be from 7th Century BC. </p>

<p>Moses supposedly lived around 1500 BC. </p>

<p>So it&#39;s not that Moses is a copy of Sargon of Akkad, but that Sargon of Akkad is a copy of Moses! </p>

Tons of other examples, just cant think of all of them now. </p>

<p>It must suck to believe a religion your whole life that is complete bullshit and lies.

<p>When you say akhenaten is not monotheism your being stupid. When people say that they mean one god. It doesn&#39;t matter if there was an idol. im pretty sure some ancient hebrews had idols of yahweh in their house.

<p>I am not saying that Judaism was the first. Contrary to the fact, I highlight in the post several ancient religions that come before it (most transparently, Pheonocian idol worship, Mesopotamian Marduk, and ancient Egyptian primordial deities. </p>

<p>As for the actual story of Job, I believe you&#39;re referring to the Ludlul-Bel-Nimeqi, which has significant differences to the point where both stories have similar themes, <a href="http://www.ancient.eu/article/226/">but aren&#39;t evidence of plagiarism</a>. </p>

<p>I am not trying to posit Judaic superiority (as I make no claim in Judaism being the first religion, only that it is the first <em>monotheistic</em> religion - a claim supported widely by academic scholars. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thats why satan&#39;s role doesn&#39;t make sense in the book of job.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you understand the Torah, Satan&#39;s role makes perfect sense. According to the Old Testament texts, basically Satan does the bidding of God, that&#39;s the point of an angel. In the story of Job, Satan acts as the District Attorney, with God being the Judge, and Job being the accused. Satan according to Jewish lore isn&#39;t evil, he&#39;s an impish trickster. Technically, in Jewish lore, Satan is anything deemed &quot;the enemy of the Jews&quot;, and yes, it can be as petty as one man&#39;s struggles against eminent domain. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m sorry you feel that way. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You dont hear alot about the parallels between middle eastern mythology and torah/bible because they want people to be brainwashed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My post proves otherwise. And most Rabbinic Scholars completely accept this distinction. Again, there is no Judaic superiority angle that you&#39;re trying to push. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If they were to tell people on the news and history channels about how the bible copied tons of stories from earlier times no one would believe in their god yahweh. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That actually occurs, it&#39;s called the Old Testament. And people still believe in God because it&#39;s about their personal relationship with Jesus. Like the tenets of Freemasonry, it&#39;s all about become a better person within. Some tend to go &quot;Book of Revelations Prepper&quot; but most just believe in their deity. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>When you say akhenaten is not monotheism your being stupid. When people say that they mean one god. It doesn&#39;t matter if there was an idol. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Monotheism = a belief in one metaphysical, omniscient, intangible Creator. Monolatry = a belief in one physical idolic representation of a God at the expense of all other current idols. See the difference? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>im pretty sure some ancient hebrews had idols of yahweh in their house. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then they wouldn&#39;t have been Hebrew, they would have been Ancient Egyptian or Akhenaten. The commandment &quot;You shall have no other Gods but me&quot; is a clear reference to the forbidden ownership of idols. As with the Golden Calf story, or worship of Baal/Moloch. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The whole story of moses was bullshit, there is no mention of moses in ancient egyptian records. </p>

<p>And yes there are records that record bad events too, so dont tell me they didn&#39;t record it because they were mad or didn&#39;t want people to know about it. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re right, bad records are a frequent collection within regimes. The Nazis also had bad records, which is why we know so much about the Holocaust. Impeccable list makers. </p>

<p>But Ancient Egyptians did have a thing against blasphemy of their pantheistic idol worship. And Ahktenaten&#39;s rule was scribbled out and whitewashed. This is fact. As with the Christian reign of Pope Joan (in this case it was because she was a woman). So it does happen and is as petty as you proclaim it isn&#39;t. </p>

<p>But you do realize that I&#39;m taking the Torah metaphorically, right? I&#39;ve mentioned it several times in my post. Canaanites take their religions literally (as do Ancient Egyptians). </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I never claimed this. Only that Judaism had roots in the 1st millenium BC. The pyramids, contrarily, were built during the time of Ramses II, in 2500 BC. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The dna tests show they were arab. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Arab wasn&#39;t a thing in 2500 BC. Ancient Egpytian was, but Egyptian as an ethnicity today is a lot different than it was 4000 years ago. At this point, it&#39;s clear what your stance is, and I look forward to dealing with your pan-Arabism tomorrow. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Spirit Cooking was invented by Aleister Crowley, used by many people in the Occult, and I actually uploaded pictures showing a spirit cooking dinner in progress, featuring hundreds of celebrities. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t consider Christianity for this reason - the theological view is &quot;corrupted&quot; as a secondary source based heavily upon Judaism. It is further &quot;corrupted&quot; by the 150 versions of the Holy Bible. Judaism only has one version - the Torah, a book unaltered throughout time. When I did cite Bible verses, I used Bible Hub, which conveniently shows you the differences between verse transcriptions on the page. </p>

<p>Judaism already provides a wealth of information, and the original text is best used to examine the freemasonry relationship.</p>

<p>Islam, in my opinion, is a cult that (by their own hand) became a religion by the sword. </p>

<p>Which is why they are omitted from this post, as they arrive too late in the game to have any relevance in the matter. Islam is essentially occultism of Judeo-Christian beliefs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you that Islam is in and of itself a cult that expanded thanks to the sword. However I think you are greatly underestimating the connection between Islam and the ancient religions of Baal and Moloch.
Yes as you said Islam took from Judaism and Christianity and mixed that with occultism, what you may not have studied much is how Islam mixed those judeo-christian beliefs with the ancient practices of babylon and the worship of the moon and sun. When you look at the origins of Islam you realize that Islam is just the continuation of those same practices with a different mask, Islam didn&#39;t appear with Muhammad, it simply evolved. </p>

<p>It&#39;s even more surprising when you see how specific Islam is in contradicting all fundamental christian beliefs yet at the same time tries to replace them.</p>

<p>I did, and those videos are nothing more than confirmation bias. Directly, literally quoting from the Book of Revelations (<em>and believe it to be foretelling the future</em>) is never a good way to start. The second video proclaims the Armageddon is nigh. Also not a good way to start. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh the music of the second video is ominous (from game of thrones) I&#39;m not a big fan either, I guess the maker of the video wanted to catch the attention that way.</p>

<p>Anyway interpreting the book of revelation is dangerous if you do not know the previous books of the bible, yet the Bible constantly reminds the reader in almost every book about the crescent moon and the different names people worship it. It&#39;s simply known in different ways and names by different people.</p>

<p>For example in the old testament Gideon refused to bow down to the idols of baal and defended his people from the armies of the amalecites (i think it was the amalecites, i&#39;m writing from my phone) like david, gideon is the announciation of the messiah, but unlike david who announces the king messiah who Reigns from jerusalem gideon announces the fighting messiah who will destroy the cresecent moon. Jesus won&#39;t precisely give flowers right when he comes back.</p>

<p>Isaiah 46:1
Bel bows down, Nebo stoops low; their idols are borne by beasts of burden. The images that are carried about are burdensome, a burden for the weary.</p>

<p>As I have stated repeatedly in my post, the power of Kek is cultural, communicative memory. Ideas. I grant no more deference to Kek (a primordial darkness deity) than I do to Ra, Baal, or Yahweh. And a deity is not a demon. </p>

<p>This post is simply explaining how it all fits together: </p>

<p><strong>&quot;Cultural memory is a kind of institution. It is exteriorized, objectified, and stored away in symbolic forms that, unlike the sounds of words or the sight of gestures, are stable and situation-transcendent: They may be trans¬ferred from one situation to another and transmitted from one generation to another. External objects as carriers of memory play a role already on the level of personal memory. Our memory, which we possess as beings equipped with a human mind, exists only in constant interaction not only with other human memories but also with &quot;things,&quot; outward symbols.&quot;</strong> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why? THERE IS ONLY ONE LIVING GOD and that is Jehovah. He sent His Son, Jesus as the ultimate sacrifice to die and pay for our sins and to set us free from sin.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is a Judeo-Christian belief system, and not a matter of fact. What you believe is what you believe, what the globalists believe is what the globalists believe. You believe in Yahweh, the Globalists believe in Moloch. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>All other religious-systems are a bastardization of Judeo-Christianity (I do NOT include talmudic judaism in this, as that is also satanism). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I have shown, no, not all religious systems are a bastardization of Judeo-Christianity. Plenty of religious worship came prior - namely the worship of Baal. </p>

<p>As for the Talmud, the entire Talmud consists of 63 tractates, and in standard print is over 6,200 pages long. It is written in Tannaitic Hebrew and Jewish Babylonian Aramaic and contains the teachings and opinions of thousands of rabbis (dating from before the Common Era through the fifth century CE) on a variety of subjects, including Halakha (law), Jewish ethics, philosophy, customs, history, lore and many other topics. The Talmud is the basis for all codes of Jewish law, and is widely quoted in rabbinic literature.</p>

<p>Ergo, it is essentially a companion text to the Old Testament, and not considered a religious text in and of itself. However, because it existed for nearly hundreds of years prior to the Edict of Constantine I, it is granted the exact same deference as Judaism, part-and-parcel, regardless of your opinion. </p>

<blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>Moloch worship comes before Baal. The only religion that&#39;s an imitation (and an imitation of Kabbalah worship at that) is that of Islam. </p>

<p>Culture didn&#39;t cave, but it surely didn&#39;t progress. Sure, Monks did all those things, but only because it was on the side of the Church&#39;s agreement. Anything that went against the Church, scientific or otherwise, went punished. </p>

<p>No friend, that IS a matter of fact.</p>

<p>You are misunderstanding quite a lot here.  </p>

<p>Talmudic (rabbinical) Judaism is not the same as OT covenantal Judaism.  Talmudism/kabbalah is satanic in nature.  OT Jewish covenants were all replaced, fulfilled really, in Christ.  And all the OT covenants lead to Christ.</p>

<p>The demons of ancient times were <em>mimicking</em> the true sacrifices for Jehovah which led to Christ.  The demons today <em>mimick</em> the final, perfect, and complete sacrifice of Christ.</p>

<p>&lt;What you believe is what you believe, what the globalists believe is what the globalists believe. You believe in Yahweh, the Globalists believe in Moloch.&gt;  You cannot have it both ways.  </p>

<p>Either good and evil exist separately or you will try and fuse them, which is to eventually invert them, using moral relativism to do so and suggesting &quot;all religion is the same&quot;.</p>

<p>Eventually this merely ends, as we are seeing in our own culture now, by simply calling virtue, vice and vice, virtue.</p>

<p>Lines must be drawn.</p>

<p>Shit like this is <em>literally</em> what the Crusades were fought over.</p>

<p><strong>The Crusades were a series of religious wars</strong> sanctioned by the Latin Church in the medieval period, especially the campaigns in the Eastern Mediterranean <strong>with the aim of capturing Jerusalem and the Holy Land from Islamic rule, to recapture Christian territory and defend Christian pilgrims, in western historiography known as &quot;the Crusades for (the recovery of) the Holy Land&quot;.</strong></p>

<p>Hey, everyone does it, it just depends what side you&#39;re on (Knight&#39;s Templar/Jewish Order of Solomon). It&#39;s the oral history of religion. The Chinese do it, the Jews do it, the Christians do it. Eventually, we all create symbolism and meaning to explain away things we don&#39;t understand. The problem comes when you&#39;re deliberately harming others to achieve your way. As the Assmann&#39;s state, it&#39;s the effecting of communicative cultural memory. Meme magic. </p>

<p>At this point, it&#39;s not even hints - it&#39;s fact. It&#39;s been going on forever in the Middle East, all the way since Baal. That&#39;s more or less why Judaism flipped the switch on child sacrifices being metaphorical instead of literal. </p>

<p>It&#39;s even a hallmark of Islam in and of itself, which is a curious phenomenon of Old Occultism - not New enough to be part of the 18th century resurgence, but not old enough to have any literary basis in the historical antiquity record. The Order of the Dragon (famous for its edict issued by the Pope, carried out by Dracula himself) was initiated to fight against growing Islamic intolerance - specifically the Ottoman Turks. The only reason their reign was granted legitimacy is because after the Ottoman Empire disolved post-WW1 (on account of having sided with the losers), the British Empire decided to give them back part of their land, and to recognize them in the British Mandate (despite overwhelming evidence of Hebrew ancestry in the region). Funnily enough, it&#39;s not that Islam was granted any deference by the British Empire, it&#39;s that the British Empire&#39;s modus operandi for granting land was to pit tribal groups against each other - Indians vs Pakistanis, Jews vs Muslims, China vs Tibet, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I hadn&#39;t written &quot;hints&quot; somebody would ask for definite proof. </p>

<p>The group Svali defined as &quot;Illuminati&quot; blood lines which seem to have infiltrated/taken over some Freemason branches or sits at the top.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe into a widespread pan european satanist network of &quot;random&quot; people. Only isolated people by place or power can form a cult and keep it alive during the age of the catholic church.</p>

<p>But these days they aren&#39;t isolated but a cancerous wide spread network through at least the named countries. They have extreme power, no problems about money at all and a generational privileged mindset. I try to understand the structure behind it. It can&#39;t have always been everywhere. So somebody actively spread it beyond its origin.</p>

<p>Therefore my idea that we deal here with a breeding program of &quot;some?&quot; european aristocracy as a counter action vs. the revolutions of the 17-19th century they lacked the man power to stop. The beheading of the France aristocracy at the time must have been a complete shock.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxil_hoax">The Taxil Hoax definitely tried to</a>. Given how deeply connected Freemasonry is to Judeo-Christian theology (Knights of Templar, Solomon&#39;s Temples) it makes sense that those who worship Pagan idols would do whatever they could to shake the cultural confidence in monotheism. </p>

<p>The globalist cabals have done similar things regarding Jewish anti-semitism - lashing out at Jews for being &quot;God&#39;s Chosen People&quot; (metaphorically). Hitler, for example, was a huge lover of the Occult. </p>

<p>Their latest &quot;trick&quot; is propagation of the idea of the Khazar Mafia, where they presuppose that a secret race of world-dominating aliens infiltrated Jews hundreds of years ago and have been at the forefront of every societal disaster, all in the name of creating a Jewish supremacy. If it weren&#39;t so dumb it&#39;d be somewhat hilarious. </p>

<p>The reason why Jews seem cabalistic is because of the Jewish Quota, which banned Jews from participating in Higher Education. It&#39;s the same action you see taken against Asian students - the search for a &quot;well rounded candidate&quot; started as a means of only selecting WASPs.</p>

<p>So only the best and brightest Jews got a chance at academia - where they obviously excelled. Then, obviously, they opened up scholarship funds for other jews so what happened to them wouldn&#39;t happen to anyone else.</p>

<p>But Rupert Murdoch isn&#39;t Jewish.</p>

<p>Bannon isn&#39;t Jewish. Ted Turner isn&#39;t Jewish. Elon Musk isn&#39;t Jewish.</p>

<p>There is no Jewish Conspiracy to take over the world because, if I recall, it was the Irish Catholic who started the Banking Cartel at the turn of the century, spurred on by the wealthy German immigrants. Jews weren&#39;t accepted into society until the early part of the 80s, at which point all their previous American oppression was whitewashed. And there was that New Age Occultism/Nazi chic movement going around. Most of the original Power Bankers of America were <em>Episcopalian</em> - those who weren&#39;t eventually converted in their lineage (Jacob Shiff was pro-Jewish but not a Zionist, his descendants became Episcopalian to marry into Al Gore&#39;s family). </p>

<p>The idea that Jews control freemasonry is part of a Soviet/Nazi propaganda machine (and Henry Ford) - The Elders of the Protocol of Zion. It&#39;s bullshit propagated by Stormfront, The Daily Stormer, etc. Their newest conspiracy is that of the Khazarian Mafia - basically a way to target certain Jews they don&#39;t like <em>while totally not being anti-semetic, guise...</em>. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fHmWcRZ72A&amp;amp;feature=related">At the end of the day, Jews aren&#39;t capable of world domination - I get three of them in a room together and we can&#39;t even decide on where to go for lunch</a>!</p>

<p>But I digress...</p>

<p>The Illuminati (whom proclaim to be of Freemasonry stock) definitely are part of the globalist cabal. </p>

<p>Basically; </p>

<p>Lol, Rothschild is not an Irish Catholic name.  And no, the market destabilization that led to the creation of the federal reserve was not caused by the Irish.  These people that called themselves Jews, Rothschilds, manipulated the financial markets long before the 1913 inception of the federal reserve.  They infiltrated the bank of England and intermarried into European royalty.  They might not be orthodox practicing Jews, but to try and pin this European people disgusts me.  Very typical.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll want a better lodge then - it really comes down to whose running the franchise. </p>

<p>The extra degrees are simply because you pay for them (33rd degree). York and Scottish Rites are side-organizations that aren&#39;t necessary. You only need to become a Master Mason (3rd degree) to be a full mason. </p>

<p>How does one go about verifying that information? Specifically the Psyops part for the Army? </p>

<p>The United States Army Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM) is an organization within both the United States Army and the National Security Agency. It&#39;s essentially the military wing of SIGNIT/NSA.</p>

<p>INSCOM also does parapsychologic research (remote viewing, mind control) with the DIA and CIA. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for this informational read. </p>

<p>Now, I wonder, if you would have the time and the inclination , for your thoughts on how does your &#39;shit&#39; ties with my &#39;shit&#39; ?  I will post a link to my previous post below, and appologize in advance for it&#39;s too much to ask for (all together ~10h of video) , </p>

<p>but I&#39;ve come to conclusion that we live in a world wrapped in veils. The first one to make us fear is pedophilia, the second one is occultism , and the third one is ufologia. They are all made to make us run away , from the knowledge of science on which the world works.</p>

<p>Fear not! - is the conclusion I came to.</p>

<p>Imagine in the ancient times , if one would see such strange thing as Spanish ships coming to a south american shores, what would the natives think ? It&#39;s been said that they couldn&#39;t even comprehend what they were looking at. The same things about flying chariot with angels ... What were those ?  Of course, in ancient times this is the only way someone could depict the flying vehicle with strange creatures in it.</p>

<p>But, all this had lead me to a conclusion of immense superstition and invention (meaningful or not) of blood sacrifice , and that the so called &#39;gods&#39; were actually some kind of (various) aliens.  Multiple sources state that they&#39;ve been &#39;here forever&#39;. Some good, some bad, looking at us, like in the zoo, intervening when needed.</p>

<p>We are people of science now, these days. We look for a reasonable explanations of things that bewilder us, don&#39;t we?</p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s time for us to wake up, to not fear the unknown, to not hide the truth from ourselves, and to look at the world and try to make it better.</p>

<p>Anyways, my own investigation had lead me aaaalll  the way to sacred geometry, origins of universe, and atomic and electromagnetic energy, and to Tesla and Einstein.</p>

<p>Please, look into this links I&#39;ve posted, and tell me what you think?</p>

<p>Those would come after the Jah-Bal-On ritual origin (as this is what the Crusades were fought over - remember it was a Holy War between Christians and Muslim in securing the Holy Land). Making it confirmation bias.</p>

<p>... something strange is going on , something reoccuring stuff, I freely connected those to electromagnetical and atomic power, Tesla was talking a lot about energy sources, I think he was on to something here, as well as Einstein, on to somethnig that was considered sacred in ancient times. They were steps from scientificly explaining the ancient , so called &#39;miracles&#39; . And I believe Tesla was stopped or limited at his research. And he was a believer in god.  Which brings us to &#39;why?&#39;. Who benefits from hiding truth about energy sources?</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s a new thing in and of itself, &quot;techno wars&quot; is just the attempt at an explanation without truly looking at the past for the answers. </p>

<p>Telsa was...odd. Not crazy, just odd. Einstein warned the bomb was a necessary evil, because he knew it was a matter of time before the Nazis discovered it. </p>

<p>They were steps from scientificly explaining the ancient , so called &#39;miracles&#39; . </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Miracles is a way of people attempting to explain natural phenomena when they don&#39;t presently have the scientific conjecture to do it with. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And I believe Tesla was stopped or limited at his research. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, by a natural death. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tesla was born in 1856 , </p>

<p>November, 1890: Discovers Wireless Power</p>

<p>With high frequencies, Tesla developed some of the first neon and fluorescent illumination. He also took the first x-ray photographs. But these discoveries paled in comparison to his illuminating a vacuum tube wirelessly - having transmitted energy through the air. This was the beginning of Tesla&#39;s lifelong obsession - the wireless transmission of energy.</p>

<p>July 15th, 1903: Wardenclyffe Testing Begins</p>

<p>&quot;The New York Sun&quot; reported the strange goings-on at Tesla&#39;s transmitter. It stated, &quot;all sorts of lightning were flashed from the tall tower and poles,&quot; and &quot;the air was filled with blinding streaks of electricity which seemed to shoot off into the darkness on some mysterious errand.&quot;</p>

<p>February, 1919: Tesla&#39;s &quot;My Inventions&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Electrical Experimenter&quot; magazine began a series of articles entitled &quot;My </p>

<p>Jul 10 1934
The New York Times publicizes Nikola Tesla&#39;s particle Beam</p>

<p>February, 1935: A Machine To End War article</p>

<p>January 7th, 1943: Tesla Dies At 86</p>

<p>..</p>

<p>So, his major inventions were all made by 1915 at best , when he was 59  .... are we to presume he clilled out by his own will , for the next 27 years ?</p>

<p><strong>The origins of Spirit Cooking</strong> can be found in the preludes to production of the Cake of Light material, a sacrament in the religion of Thelema which <strong>was founded by Aleister Crowley</strong>. <strong>The original ritual</strong>, not of the same name, <strong>is performed during the cooking of Cake of Light wafers</strong> that is to be consumed during a religious gathering. <strong>The ingredients of the Cake of Light include honey, oil, menstrual blood and sperm.</strong> The sacrament is meant to symbolize the union between the microcosm, Man, and the macrocosm, the Divine, which is a representation of one of the prime maxims in Hermeticism &quot;As Above, So Below.&quot; The consumption of the Cake of Light is a fulfillment of the sacred circle of the connection between Man and the Divine. <strong>The ceremony of &quot;spirit cooking&quot; is the modern rendition of the 19th and 20th century rituals of the Cake of Light.</strong></p>

<p>it seems like you&#39;re putting Judaism in a higher moral pedestal than all other religions</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I mentioned several times that I wasn&#39;t after Jewish supremacy. It is the second-oldest religion considered. Historical reference isn&#39;t supremacy, I simply wanted to use the least-&quot;corrupted&quot; textual source (because the Globalists heavily draw source material from Judeo-Christian influences). </p>

<p>Judaism does get brought up alongside Freemasonry among those whom understand neither (mostly due to the conflation of cabal conspiracies). And I like to debunk that.</p>

<p>That being said, those whom do grant Judaism superiority include New Age Occultists. Many esoteric grimoires are full of Jewish references and symbols, and Jewish Kabbalah is prominent in the New Age Occult movement (especially regarding demonic incantations). </p>

<blockquote>
<p>and also gives it more credibility etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Egyptian religion is just as credible, irrespective of the fact it&#39;s nearly 1000 years older. </p>

<p>I mentioned that I grant the religions equal status, and explain that this is what the globalists believe (re: Moloch). </p>

<p>One religion I do not grant any deference is Islam - too young to be considered here (8th AD founding).</p>

<p>Yes, actually it is, God is immensely powerful, even if you do not believe in him.

<p>The same reason I didn&#39;t mention Islam. Ancient Sumeria, which definitely existed, isn&#39;t relevant to Jah-Bal-On. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You also have exalted and honored the masons who are an extended arm of this ancient cult of mixing the religions foolishness you described.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s a reason why the secret society lasted as long as it has. People, for good or bad reasons, keep signing up. </p>

<p>There is no Order of the Ancient Sumarians. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>demons becoming malevolent entities is a very Christian way of looking at things. </p>

<p>demons are benign in other religions.</p>

<p>To the Jews, a demon (Satan, especially) are simply &quot;enemies of the Jewish people&quot;. In Judaism, Satan isn&#39;t even evil per se, he&#39;s just God&#39;s prosecuting attorney.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Clintons aren&#39;t bumping people off because they have nothing to hide like you entail, why else would the journalists end up dead?</p>

<p>Because they had nothing to hide (even their identities), and the Clintons found them. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes, actually it is, God is immensely powerful, even if you do not believe in him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>God is a belief system. My not believing in God shouldn&#39;t take away from your faith in believing in God. If all it takes is one person to question faith (indirectly) to your own, then it&#39;s not a very strong belief. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve never challenged what other people believed in the thread, only that this is what the Globalists believe. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>You can&#39;t deny that Trump&#39;s association with /pol/ helped him immensely. </p>

<p>Thanks for the compliment. </p>

<p>Spirits aren&#39;t good or bad, they take on whichever association we give to them - like the Assman&#39;s theory of cultural/communicative memory.</p>

<p>Perhaps that explains the yearslong attempts at slandering them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxil_hoax">The Taxil Hoax definitely tried to</a>. Given how deeply connected Freemasonry is to Judeo-Christian theology (Knights of Templar, Solomon&#39;s Temples) it makes sense that those who worship Pagan idols would do whatever they could to shake the cultural confidence in monotheism. </p>

<p>The globalist cabals have done similar things regarding Jewish anti-semitism - lashing out at Jews for being &quot;God&#39;s Chosen People&quot; (metaphorically). Hitler, for example, was a huge lover of the Occult. </p>

<p>Their latest &quot;trick&quot; is propagation of the idea of the Khazar Mafia, where they presuppose that a secret race of world-dominating aliens infiltrated Jews hundreds of years ago and have been at the forefront of every societal disaster, all in the name of creating a Jewish supremacy. If it weren&#39;t so dumb it&#39;d be somewhat hilarious. </p>

<p>The reason why Jews seem cabalistic is because of the Jewish Quota, which banned Jews from participating in Higher Education. It&#39;s the same action you see taken against Asian students - the search for a &quot;well rounded candidate&quot; started as a means of only selecting WASPs.</p>

<p>So only the best and brightest Jews got a chance at academia - where they obviously excelled. Then, obviously, they opened up scholarship funds for other jews so what happened to them wouldn&#39;t happen to anyone else.</p>

<p>But Rupert Murdoch isn&#39;t Jewish.</p>

<p>Bannon isn&#39;t Jewish. Ted Turner isn&#39;t Jewish. Elon Musk isn&#39;t Jewish.</p>

<p>There is no Jewish Conspiracy to take over the world because, if I recall, it was the Irish Catholic who started the Banking Cartel at the turn of the century, spurred on by the wealthy German immigrants. Jews weren&#39;t accepted into society until the early part of the 80s, at which point all their previous American oppression was whitewashed. And there was that New Age Occultism/Nazi chic movement going around. Most of the original Power Bankers of America were <em>Episcopalian</em> - those who weren&#39;t eventually converted in their lineage (Jacob Shiff was pro-Jewish but not a Zionist, his descendants became Episcopalian to marry into Al Gore&#39;s family). </p>

<p>The idea that Jews control freemasonry is part of a Soviet/Nazi propaganda machine (and Henry Ford) - The Elders of the Protocol of Zion. It&#39;s bullshit propagated by Stormfront, The Daily Stormer, etc. Their newest conspiracy is that of the Khazarian Mafia - basically a way to target certain Jews they don&#39;t like <em>while totally not being anti-semetic, guise...</em>. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fHmWcRZ72A&amp;amp;feature=related">At the end of the day, Jews aren&#39;t capable of world domination - I get three of them in a room together and we can&#39;t even decide on where to go for lunch</a>!</p>

<p>But I digress...</p>

<p>The Illuminati (whom proclaim to be of Freemasonry stock) definitely are part of the globalist cabal. </p>

<p>Basically; </p>

<p>Look I agree with about 80% of this. But you go WAY OFF the beam on this kek stuff. Why? Because Kek is an ancient Egyptian &#39;deity&#39; too (aka - demon).</p>

<p>Kek &#39;worship&#39; is also its own form of demon worship - just like the Set nutters and the Osiris nutters and the Baal nutters and the Moloch nutters are all worshipping demons, ultimately satan.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I have stated repeatedly in my post, the power of Kek is cultural, communicative memory. Ideas. I grant no more deference to Kek (a primordial darkness deity) than I do to Ra, Baal, or Yahweh. And a deity is not a demon. </p>

<p>This post is simply explaining how it all fits together: </p>

<p><strong>&quot;Cultural memory is a kind of institution. It is exteriorized, objectified, and stored away in symbolic forms that, unlike the sounds of words or the sight of gestures, are stable and situation-transcendent: They may be trans¬ferred from one situation to another and transmitted from one generation to another. External objects as carriers of memory play a role already on the level of personal memory. Our memory, which we possess as beings equipped with a human mind, exists only in constant interaction not only with other human memories but also with &quot;things,&quot; outward symbols.&quot;</strong> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why? THERE IS ONLY ONE LIVING GOD and that is Jehovah. He sent His Son, Jesus as the ultimate sacrifice to die and pay for our sins and to set us free from sin.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is a Judeo-Christian belief system, and not a matter of fact. What you believe is what you believe, what the globalists believe is what the globalists believe. You believe in Yahweh, the Globalists believe in Moloch. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>All other religious-systems are a bastardization of Judeo-Christianity (I do NOT include talmudic judaism in this, as that is also satanism). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I have shown, no, not all religious systems are a bastardization of Judeo-Christianity. Plenty of religious worship came prior - namely the worship of Baal. </p>

<p>As for the Talmud, the entire Talmud consists of 63 tractates, and in standard print is over 6,200 pages long. It is written in Tannaitic Hebrew and Jewish Babylonian Aramaic and contains the teachings and opinions of thousands of rabbis (dating from before the Common Era through the fifth century CE) on a variety of subjects, including Halakha (law), Jewish ethics, philosophy, customs, history, lore and many other topics. The Talmud is the basis for all codes of Jewish law, and is widely quoted in rabbinic literature.</p>

<p>Ergo, it is essentially a companion text to the Old Testament, and not considered a religious text in and of itself. However, because it existed for nearly hundreds of years prior to the Edict of Constantine I, it is granted the exact same deference as Judaism, part-and-parcel, regardless of your opinion. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>All other religious &#39;deities&#39; requires involuntary sacrifice of a young person due to their moral &#39;innocence&#39; -- lacking having committed knowing sin.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wrote about this in the post (symbolic vs literal child sacrifice). </p>

<blockquote>
<p>All other religions are just an imitation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Moloch worship comes before Baal. The only religion that&#39;s an imitation (and an imitation of Kabbalah worship at that) is that of Islam. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>P.S. - The &#39;Dark Ages&#39; were not really that dark. Monks preserved libraries, developed modern agriculture, the education system known as the trivium, and paved the way for modern-day hospitals. The idea that culture &#39;caved in&#39; during this time as been disproven.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Culture didn&#39;t cave, but it surely didn&#39;t progress. Sure, Monks did all those things, but only because it was on the side of the Church&#39;s agreement. Anything that went against the Church, scientific or otherwise, went punished. </p>
