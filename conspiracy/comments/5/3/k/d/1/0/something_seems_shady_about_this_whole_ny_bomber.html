<li>It seems like the bombs were staged in a way that were meant to minimize rather then maximize causalities. BS</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I was telling someone else, of course bona fide emergency personnel are going to show up eventually in a huge metropolis like NYC especially. The question is what are they doing? Are they actually transporting the dead and injured to a hospital or are they, as you say, getting coffee because they&#39;re being held to a block away from the scene?</p>

<p>At Sandy Hook they blocked the road leading to the school parking lot with a crowd of cars and later you had actual EMTs giving interviews saying they weren&#39;t let into the school or even near it and were pissed that they couldn&#39;t do their job.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. Somethings not right...</p>

<p>TBH, the explosion didn&#39;t even look very big or devastating. Looked like a movie prop or something. If these are jihadis getting info from the ME, you should go check out some liveleak vids of real IED&#39;s. </p>

<p>Also, 29 injured, but no pics or footage of them? How were none of them not seriously injured? A little firecracker can fuck your finger up if you hold it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m so happy I found this. </p>

<p>Couldn&#39;t agree more, I was at a concert a few blocks away when the explosion supposedly went off. The act came on and said the after party may be cancelled bc a bomb just went off a few blocks away.</p>

<p>When we leave, there was cops everywhere. We asked if we&#39;d be allowed to take the train home to LI.</p>

<p>They said, in between mouthfulls of potato chips, &quot;yea , no reason you wouldn&#39;t be able to, you know what you&#39;re best off just going to the station and finding out&quot;.</p>

<p>As we got to Madison Square Garden (Penn Station) it was an absolute ghost town. All roads shut down for miles. Tons of cop cars all over the place with no one in them.</p>

<p>There were virtually no police at Penn Station. I saw maybe 3. Being someone from the area it is down right creepy for them to not at LEAST delay the trains! Especially after a &quot;second device&quot; was found.</p>

<p>Then hearing the story today, and seeing the pictures. I couldn&#39;t believe it. First thought was that if he can build that device he would have a disposable. Then I saw the pictures! Unbelievable. And all the other sketchy details. </p>

<p>Anyway my point is, the environment of the situation felt like a drill to me.</p>

&quot;No shit.&quot; -The sane people of the world</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t believe the official story (the obvious, face value version), then you&#39;re insane.
We live in a world where shills like that influence more people than all of our civilian journalism. Or maybe we just have to keep hitting them harder...
