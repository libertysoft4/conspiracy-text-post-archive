<p>Exactly. So why more government? Get them the fuck out. Buy outs will happen, but government incubates their lives via lobbying. People are not understanding basic principles... It truly saddens me. It&#39;s not the private industry, but the government in cahoots with private industry. Regulations, rules, stipulations, etc etc, create monopolies. Why people cannot see that, is beyond me... Less is more..</p>

<p>It is entirely. You are saying that people shouldn&#39;t complain about capitalism because they use products created by companies. It would be like if I say that you can&#39;t complain about socialism because you use public roads. There is no choice in the matter.</p>

<p>No we wouldn&#39;t. We would see less. Do you think it is easy to start up a telecom company? Big companies would buy out their competitors. Just like the attempted Sprint Verizon merger. Why do you think regulations exist? Would you like to go back to a time where the Rockefellers owned 90% of the oil industry?</p>

<p>Not my fault the majority of Americans are dumb. If only two candidates have a chance at winning, I will vote for the lesser evil. At least it&#39;s better than living in Russia where Putin is effectively a dictator.</p>

<p>Not a true free market, no. Buyers need to vote with their wallets and politicians need to stay the fuck out. If they don&#39;t, they get thrown the fuck out. We just do not have a healthy society were people are proactive or values principles this nation was built on. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not a globalist, nor do I believe in consumerism. So, get rid of those two and many of our problems will be solved. Not just the US, but the world. Globalism is what allows corporations to run amok and rape us and the planet.</p>
