        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi, I&#39;m not sure if this is the right place to post. It&#39;s not so much a conspiracy but more my personal experience on the matter. I&#39;ve done some research and as always there&#39;s mixed opinions on the matter.</p>

<p>Over the last year my girlfriend (whom I share a house with) and several other of my friends are convinced that this is the only explanation for the amount of times we&#39;ve received an ad on Facebook several minutes after talking about that exact topic with our phones in our presence.</p>

<p>This has happened at least 20 times since July, so much so that we&#39;ve all abandoned the fb apps and messenger and reverted to the basic mobile site, yet it&#39;s still happening. Before anyone says anything along the lines of &#39;you&#39;ve probably searched it in the past&#39;, we&#39;re talking about really obscure and things that we&#39;ve never even heard of before that particular conversation that then suddenly appears afterwards. Most recently (yesterday) I was in a meeting with my CS lecturer, where he introduced me to a obscure statistical analysis package which I&#39;d never heard of and definitely haven&#39;t searched anything related to it before, and on the bus ride back I had an ad thrust in my face for that EXACT package I&#39;d hadn&#39;t heard of 10 minutes prior, except I had my phone out at the time to check my work rota to arrange the next meeting. This kind of thing happens almost weekly.</p>

<p>What&#39;s going on here? We don&#39;t receive any ads related to our conversations when we keep our phones and all tech out of the room, however when it&#39;s in the room we get ads related to our conversations. Seems far too coincidental. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, they most definitely can. Apps such as Siri are listening 24/7 because that&#39;s the only way the work. Facebook probably takes it to the next level. They probably have everyone&#39;s faces and voices mapped out and have consistent access to anyone&#39;s device, thus they are able to track anyone anywhere, even through other peoples phones. They then sell some of the information to advertisers for plausible deniability and then use the real juicy stuff for mass social engineering in tandem with the military industrial complex. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some family members and myself were sat around the dinner table, discussing conferencing and how it has changed in the past few years. How commonplace it was to now video call.</p>

<p>For some reason or other, everyone else thought we could improve on the technology with a device that sits in the center of a table, uses clear speakers and creates a holographic image of the person at the table with you. I dismissed the idea, but suggested a good name would be the &quot;Holo-Cube&quot;. </p>

<p>The next day facebook was advertising a product with that exact name that was in no way related to any product I had searched in the past, so there was no other basis for them to show me that ad aside from having been listening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something similar has been happening to me and now its just getting weird.  I&#39;m always on my phone looking for information. (mostly for Monster Hunter) but I always use the Google Bar app thing to search shit. For instance, I see what item I need for something, type in the first two or three letters, and the EXACT THING I&#39;m thinking of us always the first option. 
I don&#39;t know if this is a coincidence or not, but my mom mentioned something, I type in the first letter or two and the EXACT THING she said, what I&#39;m searching, is the first option. How can the phone know? It&#39;s like it&#39;s always watching. </p>

<p>-Went shopping at Burkes to buy a bra. Bought some brand I have never heard of before. Payed with cash. Got in the car, checked Twitter, and bam. There&#39;s that brand. (I forgot the brand name)
-Was sitting in the living room with a friend, she said something about how someone was bringing us Chick Fil A for dinner that night. Shortly after that, I was on the Trivia Crack app, (yes, Trivia Crack) and there&#39;s an ad for Chick Fil A.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My GF got a bearded dragon (a lizard). I&#39;ve never owned such a thing before in my life - in fact, it&#39;s way out of my norm. I&#39;m a cat person, and once I had birds in the distant past.</p>

<p>Once we got him, we were discussing how to keep him warm and I was mentioning that they had those electric heater pads you put under their tank. I had never shopped for anything like this before.  I opened up Amazon on my PC and, lo and behold, it was the first thing on my suggested items list.</p>

<p>We can think of two possibilities here: either her texting with her friend about bringing over the lizard was monitored, or one of our devices was listening to our conversations.  There are no coincidences. I have never in my life had an animal like this one and never would have, except for a random chain of events that led him to being given to us because of someone that I have never met in person needing to move.</p>

<p>For the record, I have an android and I don&#39;t have FB installed on my phone. She has an iphone and she does have the FB app installed.</p>

First time I have ever brought it up to him and I have never searched for it online.  I go online to check my email and every ad I see is for well drillers in my area.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hackers are looking for this. We sandbox phones and devices, record the SSL certificates and the handshakes, and we snoop on the traffic.</p>

<p>Portable devices don&#39;t have the horsepower needed or the memory to do real time, on device speech to text. The audio itself must be transmitted to a server which decodes it.</p>

<p>This makes the attack surface very predictable. </p>

<p>On home devices, you could tie up a processor and fit the data files necessary to do this on the fly, locally... to just send the translated text. For this, too, sand-boxing is an effective way to detect the malfeasance.</p>

<p>There is no widespread airgapping technology, so for now... everything you send to siri or everything you google is potentially public. I haven&#39;t heard of anyone catching a Television sending audio or video data, except as the terms and conditions permit.</p>

<p>Check the terms and conditions.</p>

<p>You cannot sneak this into a device without hackers detecting it. However, lots of devices have agreements which allow them to do this... but typically not cell phones.</p>
