        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The difference between the Y-chromosomes of Humans and Chimpanzees, proves that evolution from apes to humans is not plausible.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.scienceagainstevolution.org/images/v14i5g1.jpg">http://www.scienceagainstevolution.org/images/v14i5g1.jpg</a></p>

<p>The Human Y chromosome contains double the number genes than on the <a href="http://www.icr.org/article/new-chromosome-research-undermines/">Chimpanzee Y chromosome.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In other words, the chimp was lacking approximately half of the genes found on a human Y chromosome.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The human Y chromosome has twice as many genes as the Chimpanzee Y chromosome.  Humans have 41 more genes.</p>

<p>This means that in order for the ape Y chromosome to evolve into the human Y chromosome, apes had to add 41 genes.  </p>

<p>In order for apes to add genes, they would have to have a genetic mechanism to generate new genes and insert them into their chromosomes.</p>

<p>But apes do not have any &quot;gene generating system.&quot;</p>

<p>Nor do apes have a &quot;gene insertion system.&quot;</p>

<p>This means that &quot;ape to human evolution&quot; theory is missing the genetic mechanisms necessary for evolution to actually take place.</p>

<p>This is <strong>ABSOLUTE CONTRADICTING EVIDENCE</strong> that proves &quot;ape to human evolution&quot; is impossible,</p>

<p>Actually it demonstrates your lack of knowledge.</p>

<p>Nobody claims humans evolved from chimpanzees (or apes).</p>

<p>Chimpanzees and humans evolved from a common ancestor.</p>

<p>If we go far enough back in time, humans and bananas also have a common ancestor, but evolution doesn&#39;t claim we evolved from bananas.</p>

<p>From Wikipedia:  </p>

<p>The Hominidae, whose members are known as great apes or hominids, are a taxonomic family of primates that includes seven extant species in four genera: Pongo, the Bornean and Sumatran orangutan; Gorilla, the eastern and western gorilla; Pan, the common chimpanzee and the bonobo; and Homo, the human and near-human ancestors and relatives (e.g., the Neanderthal).</p>

<p>Humans are talking apes.  </p>

<p>This would all be great (if I were true) if chimps and apes today were the animals we evolved from.   You Have to understand humans aren&#39;t the only species to evolve.  And it is possible to evolve  in more than one direction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s ironic that in the end, the modern science-enthusiast is no less rigid in his thinking than the religious zealot, I see it everywhere, bold claims of objectivity yet when it comes to defending their scientific claims, all notions of scientific rigor are immediately dropped and bold, loud ad-hominems are tossed. The reason is because the modern science-enthusiast is no less religious, he is just indoctrinated into a different religion, the doctrine of scientism. The belief that modern science is so fundamentally correct that there is no use in questioning the commonly accepted dogma. No use in questioning it, even though it is so clearly outrageous and unscientific, and even though physics should be a complete laughing stock to anyone who could focus on the gibberish long enough to realize that it so clearly has traversed into the realm of sorcery. Remember physics is supposed to provide a mechanical, physical explanation of the phenomena around us. They have abandoned all but the faintest notion of such a definition, because nothing is physical about physics today. But when you question it, you are made to sound like the loon, when it is my job to question it. It is everyone&#39;s job to question science, because it should only be considered as fact when it can stand up to opposition. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right.  You are not wrong.  </p>

<p>I just checked to see if I am remembering this correctly.  </p>

<p>From Wikipedia:  </p>

<p>The Hominidae, whose members are known as great apes or hominids, are a taxonomic family of primates that includes seven extant species in four genera: Pongo, the Bornean and Sumatran orangutan; Gorilla, the eastern and western gorilla; Pan, the common chimpanzee and the bonobo; and Homo, the human and near-human ancestors and relatives (e.g., the Neanderthal).  </p>

<p>Thanks for the downvotes.  LOL.  If you are going to downvote me, at least say why I am wrong about what I said.  </p>

<p>Humans are apes.  I am sorry if that offends anyone, but we are talking apes.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Which conspiracies do you believe? If you take the red pill, the rabbit hole goes deep. Evolution is a lie created by the global elite. I&#39;m not religious at all. I believed in evolution until spending time in this sub. It&#39;s up to you to go down the rabbit hole though. It takes steps to get to evolution. Once you see just how much is a lie, the issue of evolution being a lie is actually pretty easy to understand. For example when you realize that Sandy Hook was a lie, it is easy to see that the Boston Bombing was a lie. Once you see that the Boston Bombing was a lie, it&#39;s easy to see that all of the school/church shootings are a lie. Once you can spot the false flags...then you look at 9/11 and your mind gets blown wide open. Then JFK. Then the moon. Then NASA. Then Vaccines. GMO&#39;s. Flouride. </p>

<p>FUCK! </p>

<p>Then you have a nervous breakdown and leave the internet.</p>

<p>But you come back. Because you think it can&#39;t get any worse.</p>

<p>But you are so fucking wrong! The rabbit hole just keeps going. And shit get&#39;s insane.</p>

<p>Evolution being a lie is not the bottom of the rabbit hole. It gets scary. </p>

<p>Each step gets you closer and closer. Each step is easy because of the steps before it. I don&#39;t think I can convince you that the world is flat. But I&#39;m pretty sure you can see Boston was fake. Go look at Sandy Hook and Boston. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay. So you know that high ranking members of the United States government were planners and conspirators to 9/11. </p>

<p>That&#39;s pretty sick, right? Pretty audacious? Pretty ballsy? Almost unthinkable?</p>

<p>Next step in the rabbit hole might be NASA. Start with the moon landing. Obviously faked.</p>

<p>JFK.</p>

<p>Then just keep going.</p>

<p>Eventually you realize that the global elite psychopath cult is real. Call them the illuminati (because that is what they are). </p>

<p>Once you realize they control everything, then you question everything.</p>

<p>Is the world a spinning globe or a stationary flat disc? Hmm. Let&#39;s think about it.</p>
