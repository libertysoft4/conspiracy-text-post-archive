<p>Remember when the teacher needed the class to be quiet and the teacher would shhhh and throw up a peace sign and everybody would follow suit?</p>

<p>Well i threw up that signal today in class.  This is the second school i tried this with the same result.</p>

<p>Well, they knew what to do.  Excepf they didnt do the peace sign.  They did the sign of the devil!  They didn&#39;t call it that, and i forget what they called it, but they did it all the same.</p>

<p>WTF!!!  WHY??? HOWWW?</p>

<p>Fucking creepy!!! Why are our children now using the sign of the devil to be quiet???</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point is pretty much asking why you care what kind of hand signal the kids are throwing up as long as its not gang-related.  </p>

<p>Obviously you have a predetermined notion that this hand signal is the &#39;sign of the beast&#39;.  What hand signal is it?  Can you link a picture?  Because google brings up at least two different ones.</p>

<p>And thanks for not answering any of my questions.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>They didn&#39;t actually have their thumb extended, like the picture I have linked.  The symbol they made is best known as the sign of the devil.  Someone taught that to them, in public elementary school</p>

<p>You would better believe if I was a real teacher I would teach them the peace sign as well and I would follow that rabbit hole as far as I could in regards to teaching children teh sign of the devil to shut the fuck up.</p>

<p>Or maybe shutting the fuck up is the devil?  </p>

<p>No it isn&#39;t. I never asked to be possessed. Never intended to, I was a child..</p>

<p>and no, I know very little about the occult. </p>

<p>So STFU, about things you do not know about? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have done Salvia though</p>

<p>So drugs? Meet evil spirits sober. Then come back to me. There are evil and good. Throwing up a hand sign will not win any props among them. This aint a music video or a street corner.... </p>

<p>It is just weird because we def didn&#39;t make that symbol.  Next time I will ask them where they learned that.  The answer is probably just there teacher, so I&#39;ll have to ask a teacher why THEY were told to do that and by whom</p>

<p>It is weird, I haven&#39;t noticed how many times this hand signal has been used by politicians until I googled it. Thanks for sharing.</p>

<p>Here is one of Obama using it: <a href="http://henrymakow.com/upload_images/barack-obama-horns-texas-080910jpg-1a909755b4fab646_large.jpg">http://henrymakow.com/upload_images/barack-obama-horns-texas-080910jpg-1a909755b4fab646_large.jpg</a></p>
