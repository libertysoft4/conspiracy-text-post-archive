        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I think my time posting here might be coming to an end. It was quite a while ago when I first heard of the NWO but I was roughly 18 then and had &quot;better things to do with my time.&quot; That all changed when ISIS started fucking shit up and I found out about TPP and other anti-internet policies. I immediately felt like something was off about this group when the Paris attacks happened. I&#39;ve been wasting so much time this last year really digging into the NWO because I thought us trying to prevent it was a cause worth fighting for. It just seems to grow more hopeless by the day. </p>

<p>I have to admit that the whole b a d s e l f e a t e r psyop really got to me and it wasn&#39;t because of the abortion BS. It was the wild goose chase that really bothers me now. There were quite a few reasons I was expecting it to be the start of the more damaging emails exposing the NWO/elites or whatever the fuck you want to call them. Julian Assange even said in interviews last week that we would start seeing teasers for the upcoming leaks this week which further led me to believe this might be it. The Mr. Teeth fb page did a great job of making it seem like it was going to be something important along the lines of government corruption. &quot;We put our trust in the wrong people&quot; anyone? I guarantee we were mean&#39;t to believe this. This guy&#39;s video presentation ensured very few people would be turned to his cause. At the very least he could have shown the abortion vid at the beginning before he even started talking and used a better tone. I&#39;m almost certain everyone who&#39;s not an agent in this subreddit agrees that controlled opposition exists. Why would the PTB abandon such proven tactics for control? Even if this guy wasn&#39;t directly involved he could have been hired for a desirable sum. IF the PP abortion clinics are actually dedicated to Moloch, would it not make sense to have controlled opposition to protect your interests(PP)? I hope most of you understand the main places all of the info came from were godlikeproductions, ar15, /x/, /pol/ and the subreddit dedicated to it. This was targeted at specific people and most of those places are known to be anti-hillary. Why didn&#39;t they make it a bit more specific to abortion and target some religious forums that could have made it more viral? Didn&#39;t her campaign recently announce they were going to take on the &quot;alt-right movement&quot;? AKA full propaganda mode. A lot of things have changed in 70 years so propaganda is surely much more advanced nowadays right? </p>

<p>Anyways, here&#39;s real reason I&#39;m starting to think this movement is doomed. The sense of mockery and wasted time really got me thinking afterwards. I&#39;m not trying to present any of this as fact but it is something that should be considered. <strong>I really do hope I&#39;m wrong here but what if wikileaks/snowden are controlled opposition as well?</strong> If legit, they are people I would consider heroes so I am not trying to discredit them. I guess I&#39;m hoping for reassurance that they are legit and the best way to do that is to have people debate my reasons for thinking otherwise. This is not something I would have given much thought had b a d s e l f e a t e r not been such a letdown. However, the PTB are very smart and have been controlling mankind for a very long time. Probably even longer than we think. They play the long game and look at the big picture and it would be very true to say that 99% of the world doesn&#39;t. They won&#39;t be outsmarted by your average citizen. When considering the big picture you have to realize that our whistleblower saviors could be in on it. There was really nothing teased about clinton this week if you think about it. There was another DNC leak that wasn&#39;t actually posted on their site and then the TISA/TPP etc. Those aren&#39;t teasers about Clinton. I can&#39;t be only person that followed b a d s e l f e a t e r because I thought it was the teaser JA was referring to. Could he have said that to indirectly give credibility to it? Timer hits 0 and a teaser plays. Why not?</p>

<p>Have you ever considered that the elections matter more to you than they do to the PTB? Maybe it doesn&#39;t matter who wins as much as who DOESN&#39;T win. Surely, you&#39;ve considered that destabilization of America is the real goal.. At least I hope because it&#39;s sure looking that way. I came across an interesting article today that presents some very good points. Again, I hope for humanity&#39;s sake that I&#39;m wrong about this but it&#39;s worth reading: <a href="http://www.tomatobubble.com/snowden_fake.html">http://www.tomatobubble.com/snowden_fake.html</a> . They seem to be just as involved in the destabilization of the ME as the PTB were which is at least unsettling. </p>

<p>I should probably address the dead man&#39;s switch counterargument right away. Just like many people on this planet believe in some sort of God as long as somebody doesn&#39;t show them concrete evidence they don&#39;t exist, many people will believe there&#39;s actually more damaging info in the dead man&#39;s switch as long no one can show them concrete evidence there isn&#39;t. I can&#39;t blame people because selfishness and stubbornness is human nature. People are too stubborn in their beliefs to question them. Another argument for WL being propaganda is the timing of their releases. They are NOT trying to help Bernie win. Please don&#39;t be this naive. What do you think is going to happen if they expose Trump &amp; Clinton working together late Oct? Not very many Trump supporters if any believe in this possibility. I have a feeling it&#39;s mostly Bernie supporters who suspect this....Destabilized America would affect the entire world in a negative way 100%. What happened to every  ME country that had it&#39;s leadership taken out? Power vacuum. There would surely be an immediate global power grab competition if the world police state has it&#39;s own American spring(AKA WWIII).</p>

<p>But who knows? Maybe JA is on our side? Maybe he&#39;s on his own side and wants to watch the world burn? I sure would in his position especially when the large majority of the global population doesn&#39;t care. Again, not trying to discredit anyone, just would like to be reassured destabilization is not the goal. Unite! TBC, maybe?</p>

<p>TL;DR
Kinda feel like Earth is doomed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was definitely a psyop. The Athiest movement is the biggest threat to the control mechanism for future generations. Among other things, they are trying to smear some of the most popular conspiracies as an anti-abortion movement. </p>
