    <div class="md"><p><strong>The mods of this subreddit have not removed any posts relating to the Stonetear incident*.</strong> Is this clear enough for you?</p>

<p>You clearly don&#39;t understand how reddit works at all, and the claim you have made in your post is completely false.</p>

<p>The mods have no control whatsoever over the reddit algorithm that determines how posts perform. Posts that get to the front page only stay there for a day or two max - they then slide back down to be replaced by more recent posts. This process is automatic.</p>

<p>Every action taken by the mods on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is recorded in the modlog, and this is available for anyone to check by clicking the link in the sidebar.</p>

<p><a href="https://r.go1dfish.me/r/conspiracy/about/log">https://r.go1dfish.me/r/conspiracy/about/log</a></p>

<p>*Clarification: Automoderator (which is a bot) redirects posts with links to certain sites to the spam folder automatically. The mods have not removed any Stonetear/Combetta posts which made it through to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>Scroll back in time on that archive link and you can see how absurd this post really is, considering that we are one of the only subreddits that allowed coverage of this incident/news and it completely dominated the subreddit for over 24 hours.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for your response.  I understand the need to keep the front page &quot;fresh&quot; and moving new stories in to replace the old ones.  I have no problem with that.  But why not leave up at least one of these posts regarding Stonetear on the front page?  They had thousands of upvotes.  But the mods chose to leave the Milo story up for 7-14 days which only has @ 680 upvotes?  That is lame IMO...</p>

Old posts should be removed after a few days.

<p>Ah, here&#39;s the crux of this whole post, I believe. </p>

<p>If I&#39;m reading through the lines correctly, you&#39;re a team elephant partisan and that tribal zeal causes you to wrongly think that by sticking that corruption scandal in <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> post we at <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> are making a political statement.

</blockquote>

<p>I think he&#39;s suggesting using it in way that sheds light at bigger more important issues. The Paul Combetta story is arguably far bigger as it represents that a possible future leader can&#39;t be trusted with classified documents. Our national security depends on it. The other is a scam for money.  Also bad but not a threat to national security.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>While i agree with you on that bad press being well deserved, I don&#39;t think it would be a big deal to have more than one anouncement sticky. There were 2 in the week leading up to and through 9/11.  If i might make the suggestion of representing both of the announcements, it would do wonders for a balanced discussion on both sides of party lines.  And it would help to ease any paranoia of subscribers thinking there might be politcal bias at the root of this subreddit.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a 4 day old post, not &quot;a week&quot;. Exaggeration doesn&#39;t help your case. And as someone else mentioned here, there are still 6 of the Clinton IT guy posts on the top 25 front page too... compared to only one Trump sub post. The whole premise of OP&#39;s post here is completely untrue. It&#39;s my opinion that he&#39;s just trying to incite drama here.</p>
