    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s as fake as fuck.</p>

<p>Over at r/futurology and some of the sci and tech subreddits, they fucking love this guy. It&#39;s like he&#39;s reddit&#39;s boyfriend or something.</p>

<p>But the guy is a billionaire. And in the kind of world we live in, you don&#39;t become (or remain) a billionaire without being a certain type of person.</p>

<p>Musk&#39;s real ambition is to get into space. Him and his friends eventual goal is to privatize access to space. Someday they&#39;ll want to privatize NASA and get a hold of all their assets.</p>

<p>Then they&#39;re going to want to get out into space and become trillionaires by mining asteroids and doing whatever else. Since US or whatever laws don&#39;t apply in space, they could also do all kinds of research or other activities that would be totally illegal anywhere else.</p>

<p>tldr; Space is the new frontier. Just like the old west, whoever gets out there first gets incredibly rich and powerful. This is what Musk and others like him are <em>really</em> after.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Elon is a member of the <em>Atlas Shrugged</em> demographic; one of reality&#39;s answers to Tony Stark.  There are a few of those.  A lot of people hate them, but they truthfully don&#39;t bother me.  I&#39;ve mostly got rid of my sense of inadequacy over not being one of them, too now, which took a long time.  If he wants to build electric cars and fly people into space, more fun to him; it&#39;s a lot more work than I am prepared to do, but when I was younger I used to have ambition myself.</p>

<p>Look at the age and post count of my account before you assume that; but then again, I hardly need to prove anything to random people on the Internet.</p>

<p>I am basically just tired of viewing people as monsters, like everyone else in this sub does, is all it is.  Elon also genuinely doesn&#39;t come across to me as someone who is that bad comparitively, either.  Yes he&#39;s a billionaire, but there are worse people.</p>

<p>Stop wallowing in hatred purely for the sake of it.  It isn&#39;t good for you.</p>

<p>The NWO is slowly falling to pieces.  Brexit was a major kick in the pants, and people in general are just getting tired of their shit.  Putin rebelled recently, as well.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think Elon is anything sinister, other than possibly being a common or garden variety self-aggrandising psychopath, which is hardly anything unusual these days.  Tesla are doing something positive by selling electric cars, even if in Elon&#39;s mind, he&#39;s just getting in on the ground floor.  Occasionally I hear about him being involved with SpaceX or a random bit of transhumanist silliness, but that is background noise to me.  I spent too long being paranoid about the transhumanists; I don&#39;t want to be scared of them any more.  I won&#39;t live forever anyway; none of us will.</p>

<p>I hope Elon has fun.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that all of this could be theater in preparation for a bigger agenda. Not unlike 9-11 and stuff that led to it being theater for that whole agenda.</p>

<p>For one weird example of the weird agendas they have -  in this video they talk about how there is this sacred geometrical line that goes around the Earth and the people in power constantly wage war just on this line for some reason...  they have really weird plans that are difficult for us to understand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t be one of the <em>Atlas Shrugged</em> demographic and also be an Alpha.  Alpha&#39;s assume responsibility for the pack, which is what the role of the Alpha actually is about, not being the &#39;strongest&#39;.  They lead hunts for food, fight to defend all of the members of their pack and so on.  </p>

<p>Being the strongest is merely the means of determining who the Alpha is, not what he should do once becoming Alpha.  If a wolf who was of the <em>Atlass Shrugged</em> mindset became Alpha, he would just wander off from the pack and no longer be an Alpha, having abandoned his responsibilities, and become just another lone wolf.</p>

<p>Also, being an Alpha doesn&#39;t give one carte blanche to just treat the others however he wishes- if he becomes too heavy-handed the rest of the pack will turn on and kill him or drive him away. </p>

<p>It&#39;s amazing how often that term is misunderstood and twisted around to mean nothing more than &#39;stronk&#39;.  </p>

<p>I recommend starting with his paper from Oct 2013 &quot;From Theosophy to the Beat Generation&quot; and work your way forward through his papers. He makes discoveries as he goes along, and the papers kind of build on each other, so it&#39;s best to start more or less at the beginning and work your way forward. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>you&#39;re right.  they did send other creatures and measured the radiation.  </p>

<p>Instrumentation flown on these missions gathered data on micrometeor flux, solar and cosmic rays, magnetic fields, radio emissions, and solar wind. Many photographs were taken and biological payloads were also flown. Zond 5 was the first spacecraft to carry a group of terrestrial creatures (tortoises being the most complex) on a circumlunar flight and return relatively safely to Earth. Zond 5 splashed down in the Indian Ocean after descending steeply with a 20 G deceleration rate. Although unsafe for humans, these high Gs apparently didn&#39;t affect the tortoises&#39; health, and they were reportedly able to breed afterwards </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you ever heard the theory of why we went to war in Afghanistan? One reason supposedly was the drug trade...  and the other was the incredible amount of elements in their mountains that could be mined - for making batteries for electric cars. Then we have Musk come along and start the electric car industry all of a sudden.. And he is taking over the space industry too... I don&#39;t think the people in power want someone out of their control in control of the space industry.</p>

<p>For a start, there is the hair transplant.  That could be the major part.</p>

<p>The other part I think is his rapid rise -- and here is my theory, could be totally wrong, this guy has the backing of the US Government to do <em>something</em> we don&#39;t know yet.  Just like Howard Hughes back in the day.  </p>

<p>He seems to be a front for something.</p>

<p>Too good to be true.</p>

<p>That and the hair transplant perhaps explains the weird vibe.</p>

<p>There is no evidence whatsoever that &quot;warp drives&quot; can or do exist.  If there is any please point me in that direction.</p>

<p>I think advanced propulsion technology exists, certainly, but it doesn&#39;t utilize warp drives or tear through space-time, it utilizes the relationship between electromagnetism and gravity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, as you crank up the disturbance to the em field through an extremely fast rotating capacitor, you can locally reduce the gravitational effect. That essentially can allow for inertialess travel.</p>
