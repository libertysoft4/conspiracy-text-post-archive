Yea that don&#39;t want anyone thinking about how disastrous it would be if a pipeline broke there. They want to keep doing whatever the hell they want to do (make lots of money) at ours and the environments expenses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even when hundreds of thousands of people were suddenly unable to drink their own water because &quot;Freedom Industries&quot; (most ironic corporate name ever) spilled toxic chemicals into the Elk river, there wasn&#39;t much coverage at all, and it was covered up just as quickly as they could make it happen.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/11/us/west-virginia-chemical-spill.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/11/us/west-virginia-chemical-spill.html</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s some explanation by John Pilger:</p>

<p>&quot;Why has so much journalism succumbed to propaganda? Why are censorship and distortion standard practice? Why is the BBC so often a mouthpiece of rapacious power? Why do the New York Times and the Washington Post deceive their readers?</p>

<p>Why are young journalists not taught to understand media agendas and to challenge the high claims and low purpose of fake objectivity? And why are they not taught that the essence of so much of what&#39;s called the mainstream media is not information, but power?</p>

<p>These are urgent questions. The world is facing the prospect of major war, perhaps nuclear war - with the United States clearly determined to isolate and provoke Russia and eventually China. This truth is being turned upside down and inside out by journalists, including those who promoted the lies that led to the bloodbath in Iraq in 2003.</p>

<p>The times we live in are so dangerous and so distorted in public perception that propaganda is no longer, as Edward Bernays called it, an &quot;invisible government&quot;. It is the government. It rules directly without fear of contradiction and its principal aim is the conquest of us: our sense of the world, our ability to separate truth from lies.</p>

<p>The information age is actually a media age. We have war by media; censorship by media; demonology by media; retribution by media; diversion by media - a surreal assembly line of obedient clichés and false assumptions.&quot; <a href="http://johnpilger.com/articles/war-by-media-and-the-triumph-of-propaganda">http://johnpilger.com/articles/war-by-media-and-the-triumph-of-propaganda</a></p>

<p>I&#39;ve come to the very sad conclusion in recent years that americans are just too goddamn stupid and willfully ignorant to care.  The new Iphone 7 just came out, and I&#39;m certain many care about that, and there are many new cat videos that have gone viral though.  Disgust doesn&#39;t even begin to touch the level of contempt I feel toward my fellow countrymen.  The whole world could change, if they only gave a shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The root cause is that at one time in our culture, the news existed to inform people of current events and they took that responsibility seriously.  Journalism actually meant something and people had pride around it. There was even a law that required the media to report THE NEWS in a &#39;fair and balanced way&#39; (a phrase which is but a caricature of itself now),  and that law--the fairness doctrine--was repealed in 1987<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairness_Doctrine">[1]</a></sup> because of Reagan/Bush Sr.  cryptofascist antinational corporatists and their cadre of doom (son, cheney rummy) who think it&#39;s ok to lie to people all the time and even do 911...and now try to kill off conspiracy theorists with disinfo inside of disinfo</p>

<p>Everyone else is clueless because the media forcibly makes them so.  Even conditioning them to resist new information (which is funny because cass sunstein running obama&#39;s ministry of truth to combat conspiracy theorists says that &#39;conspiracy theorists are resistant to new information&#39;---no shirt shylock, it&#39;s because that info is coming from a honeybasterding government disinformationalist and psychocivilizer of the masses)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m an American citizen and it doesn&#39;t insult me at all. The level of willful ignorance in this country is absolutely staggering. If you don&#39;t identify as either a democrat, republican or a Christian; you&#39;re a dangerous idealist. The amount of false information spouted by people as fact on a daily basis is completely absurd. Show proof that their dribble is false, and you get a chuckle and a look that says go put on your tinfoil hat. Then only thing that will ever motivate the masses here is complete economic collapse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m with you all the way. There are entirely too many that are tired as hell. Hungry as to hell boot, often as not. When you&#39;re living paycheck to paycheck you&#39;re vulnerable. You&#39;re in a constant state of fear. &quot;My god I&#39;m still short $86 dollars for rent. I only payed half the electric bill and I have no groceries. Please don&#39;t let something else come up.&quot; I know, I&#39;ve been there myself. I have had those exact thoughts before. </p>

<p>So take all that fear and anxiety add to it the dead tiredness that comes from working 60+ hours a week. Then add the constant fear mongering blasted from every tv in the country. Hot button words like &quot;terrorism&quot;, &quot;Islam&quot;, &quot;gay marriage&quot;. Your entire life is spent in fear and that&#39;s a powerful tool.</p>

<p>This is exactly what the system is designed for. Even if you become aware. What are your options? Strike and be homeless and hungry? Play the game, break your back for pennies? Unity is the only choice. </p>

<p>Everyday there are new groups to blame, to hate, to shun. The only chance we have is to stand together. No labels except human beings. It&#39;s not easy though. It takes sacrifice. Some, far too many, are just too lazy. Others like you say are too tired. Some can&#39;t risk the ones who rely on them for support. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll get off my soapbox now. I hope I made it clear that my comments weren&#39;t aimed at the group you were referencing. There are many who fit into that position, but they aren&#39;t the ones keeping up with the kardashians, and standing in line for the new Iphone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hope Tedric answers, but in case he/she doesn&#39;t, I&#39;ll put it this way, just as food for thought.  Every year things get just a bit tougher, every year it&#39;s more difficult to make ends meet, isn&#39;t it?  Prices are rising while the dollar is worth less.  You have to do without, juggle finances... Every year the hamster wheel gets a little tougher to keep spinning.  Forget vacations or visiting abroad as we might have once done.  Forget that decent home or new car, that&#39;s near impossible to pull off now, we have to set our sights and expectations lower.  It&#39;s all by design.  As you&#39;re alluding to, you don&#39;t have the time.  It&#39;s a catch 22, you&#39;ve got to keep working now, retirement is almost out of the question, so you have to keep working until you <em>die?</em></p>

<p>This will only continue, this cycle until the wheels fall off.  As you yourself admit, you have the passion but no time.  If you want the needed change, you must make the time.  There&#39;s simply no way around that.</p>

<p>General strikes work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course, I very much agree with you, but feel that we&#39;re both correct.  That was more a moment of frustration, but I really believe that up until a point fairly recently, it was acceptable to just believe our government had our best interests at heart, and our media was full of pop culture, but hey, that&#39;s no big deal even though they no longer work to inform us well, etc.  But, there comes a time when things like the bank bailouts happened, the realization that only 6 major companies control our media (I believe most of us are aware of this by now...) the understanding that nothing of real consequence is ever changed for the better, that our roads and bridges are falling apart while the average american has seen real income flat for about 40+ years, while corporations profits, the stock market and productivity are at all time highs.  You and I figured out that we were being fucked over.  Anyone who chooses to read even a little, to have a sense of wanting to understand how things seem to work, will quickly understand that our country is entirely corrupted.</p>

<p>For me it was around 2006 when I got curious and started to investigate 9/11.  I was working full time, with barely any free time for myself.  I spent weeks reading things online that scared the shit out of me.  I faced that hideous realization, and feel that most people should have also by now.  But instead, people are easily placated with how large Kim Kardashians ass is, the latest fancy car and other material things.  It&#39;s become so obvious that we are literally living in a Matrix of sorts, you even see it in the checkout line at the grocery store, and with every commercial.  It&#39;s easy to see our government cares little for our welfare by noticing how many drugs are suddenly taken off the market instead of having them properly tested over time for safety, by how they will not remove cannabis from schedule I which is ludicrous, and how little they care if people can ever retire with dignity with the gradual removal of safety nets, etc.  I began to wonder what the hell was going on back in the 1980&#39;s when Reagan literally closed all of the mental healthcare facilities nationwide...</p>

<p>I do blame my fellow american for not doing more in todays atmosphere.  We are very close to WWIII.  There is saber-rattling currently going on with Russia and even China, and yet I don&#39;t see anyone even speaking about it in the least.  Nuclear war is a real possibility in the next several years, the way things are happening.  It takes a tiny bit of civic-mindedness to want to know what&#39;s really going on, and my fellow american deserves a big fat F for that grade, especially now, because in the last few years especially, it&#39;s become so blatantly obvious that we are in big trouble.  Just yesterday, we agreed to give Israel 38 billion iirc per year, for the next decade, which is the largest aid package in history.  I didn&#39;t see any outrage, or even any question about it anywhere except in this sub.  That deal has been on the table for the last 10 months, but not a peep out of the public.  Not a word about how that money should be used here, to fix our problems.  Nothing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve tried to make sense of it all, the seemingly apathetic response of the American people toward corruption in politics. The easy thing to do is blame the baby boomers. All this shit happened on their watch. The middle class was healthy and thriving in the 50s, now it&#39;s practically non existent. But, idk f that duly explains it. Most people are outraged by what they see happening in this country. But, now that Americans have to work two jobs just to be able to afford the basic necessities, most people are simply too tired or don&#39;t have enough time to go out and protest. But, then again it&#39;s probably more complicated than all of that</p>

There are certainly a lot of pissed off people, but I think if we are being realistic, it&#39;s probably around 10-20% of us.

    <div class="md"><p>Someone questioned me but deleted their reply, so I&#39;ll give my follow up here:</p>

<p>I do blame them, yes.  As I said above, at some point in the recent past, it became obvious that we&#39;re being had.  We are very much like Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz at this moment.  If we clicked our heels together, protested and didn&#39;t back down, things would almost immediately change.  Look at what Iceland just accomplished.  </p>

<p>&quot;Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will.&quot; - Frederick Douglass.  It&#39;s way beyond past time the american public should have demanded change.  It&#39;s way past time the american public should have realized there are more important things than football and the latest gadget.  We should have become enraged when the Snowden revelations happened, after all, it wasn&#39;t the american public that caused 9/11.</p>

<p>I work at a restaurant that has a contract with the workers.

So they have 200 plus guys walking the hills of my county looking for the exact source. I theorize it was blown on purpose. Either to drive up prices, or as an excuse to enter the state of emergency which I believe governer Bentley has already done. They WILL NOT LET THE MEDIA IN. A guy from al.com has been pestering us to take him on a food drop just so he can get pictures. There&#39;s some pretty shady shit going on. It&#39;s way too secretive for there not to be. That&#39;s what I know as of two or three days ago. I&#39;ll try and learn more as fast as I can. Feel free to copy and paste this in the thread. As I have deleted my comment a few minutes ago.</p>

<p>Thank you for your time, I hope this snippet of info is useful to someone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m in Auburn, AL and several gas stations here have run out completely. The ones that haven&#39;t run out are limiting purchases to 10 gallons.</p>

<p>And we&#39;ve got a home game tonight against Texas A&amp;M that&#39;s starting soon, so this town is currently flooded with visitors and RVs. It won&#39;t surprise me to hear about people getting stuck here because they can&#39;t get the gasoline to leave! </p>

<p>I&#39;m glad I filled my tank yesterday.</p>

<p>Edit to add: gas prices are going up according to friends. And here is a video al.com released: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/aldotcom/videos/10153823745632483/?pnref=story">https://www.facebook.com/aldotcom/videos/10153823745632483/?pnref=story</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Apparently the most they can raise prices is $0.25 when a state of emergency is declared. So at least the blatent price-gouging will be limited. I remember on the afternoon of 9/11/01 the QV at the corner of University/Donahue had jacked gas up to like $8/gallon.</p>
