<p>He knows that the people buying his products are a bit more awake and him being a shill makes them a great target to poison.</p>

<p>I would never, EVER ingest ANYTHING coming from the InfoWars camp.</p>

<p>Just as your water is fluorinated, you can no doubt expect his products be tainted to emasculate you in some way or another.</p>

<p>Should be rule of thumb to not ingest any products from any &quot;news source&quot;. In InfoWars case, it could be dangerous.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve posted quite a bit about him though, for what purpose? What was the purpose of posting the &quot;Alex Jones flooding YouTube to censor his own stuff&quot; thread?

They like to state that all illnesses are caused by vitamin/mineral deficiency. Come on now ... It&#39;s not hard to lose weight and be healthy without buying overpriced shit, Clyde. Hell, if you believe that shit actually works, you can look up the ingredients and buy yourself supplements and save yourself a lot of money.

    <div class="md"><p>I support Alex Jones.  This is just more of the discrediting BS that he has been subject to his whole career.  He has done more for the truth movement than anyone else and woken up more people than anyone else.  After all these years he&#39;s proved to me he is his own man and I&#39;ll trust him unless proven otherwise.  </p>

<p>As a side, wouldn&#39;t your time be better spent attacking the people that are proven to be the real problem, rather than an independent truth media icon with unfounded claims?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t necessarily support Alex Jones, though in the name of &#39;free speech&#39;, his voice is no less important than any other in alternative media.</p>

<p>He was one of the key influences that helped me wake up. I moved on from there and dug a lot deeper. In retrospect, he does engage in a lot of fearmongering...but whatever you think of him, he is a great &#39;entry level&#39; info source for people who are beginning to question the official narratives of the mainstream media. Just because one might have &#39;outgrown&#39; his rhetoric does not make his voice irrelevant....just personally irrelevant.</p>

<p>And no, i&#39;ve never bought a product from the website, ha.</p>
