        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This just crossed my mind, they&#39;re definitely trying to create a race war, they&#39;re also trying to create fear and gun control through terror and false flags, is it potentially possible that they actually have no intentions of keeping Hillary as president, but having her elected to throw our faith in the system entirely , even the baby boomers and such that still suckle on everything they say, but is it possible they&#39;re blatantly rigging news stories and Reddit and Google and lying about shit that&#39;s been out, and Wikileaks and Anonymous is all the Government trying to destroy their reputation to create another revolution that they can declare Martial Law on while at the same time starting a war with Russia to make a WW3, but they&#39;re in on it too , and the end result after the war is the NWO, the one world Government ..... Just a thought.  Make it seem like it&#39;s our idea and shit to run head long into it cause we will all be filled with so much rage if Hillary gets in, cause it will clearly be a rigged election, because they know together we are strong , but divided  and blinded with rage we are weak .... Just , they have 150 years of rigging shit under their belt and it&#39;s never been more obvious they&#39;re up to some bullshit ... Why now are they being so sloppy and slipping up so much?It would also go hand in hand with the theory that Trump is placed to run against her for a reason, at first so she looks good, and now he&#39;s dropping lines like &quot;because you&#39;d be in jail&quot; In a debate, bringing a lot of her crime to the fore front, so when she gets &quot;elected&quot; even older people will revolt... It would make sense that he&#39;s in on it too again if this is the case. <em>SINCE POSTING THIS I&#39;ve literally watched this go up a vote, then get immediately down voted, then up a vote and then down voted, remember to upvote if you agree! :)</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s nothing inherently wrong with the ideal of unifying governments, and I really find it offensive that people in the 21st century still latch on to the idea of nations and borders. Nations, borders and religions cause <em>more</em> problems than they ever solve, and that will continue to be the case.</p>

<p>Nations and borders are why we lost jobs overseas (because there&#39;s no world minimum wage.) Nations and borders are why we have ideological and cultural conflicts - because people aren&#39;t given the same opportunities and the same access to education. Nations and borders will also be a continuing problem with regards to the ecological crisis, because developing nations have no incentive to put in place environmental regulations.</p>

<p>So while I can see and understand what you&#39;re saying about a fear of World War III (people should be afraid of it AND nuclear weapons, and should do everything in their power to promote peace and prosperity with all cultures and nations) and why you might be afraid of disarmament (the chances of it ever happening in the United States nation-wide are slim to none, though - it&#39;d be a logistical nightmare besides getting popular support outside of cities) you should consider the possibility that unification would be our greatest chance at the civilized world surviving as the centuries drag on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The immigration is not being pushed - if you look into it, you will find many of these people are fleeing to other, more stable places, typically because their world has been so destablized by both action (middle eastern invasions over the past half century) and inaction (use of corporate slave labor and ignoring human rights abuses.)</p>

<p>In addition to those more direct issues, if the average world temperature rises another degree centigrade, most of the scientific community agrees it will result in huge swaths of land formerly populated becoming incapable of sustaining life, and that&#39;s ignoring the effects of water shortages.</p>

<p>You brought up depopulation, and that&#39;s a real threat from natural causes anyway - mass immigration and lack of water/food famine will be absolutely terrible in the coming half century if the scientific community is correct in their postulations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Christians had a death grip on systems of government for centuries. The same people wagging their fingers at Muslims are most likely conceived by an ancestral line going back to times when people were stoned to death or burned for heresy - we have examples of that even in US history, because as we should all know, we were mostly settled by puritans.</p>

<p>You couldn&#39;t be more obvious with the baiting, but the fact of the matter is, as Muslims become better educated and more a part of the global world, they will be less inclined to follow their own absurd religious tenets. There will always be fanatics, though, just like we still have people going around knocking on doors, telling people the world is going to end and they need to join up to save themselves.</p>

<p>If you think those same people (Jehova&#39;s Witnesses, in this case) wouldn&#39;t love to have control over your system of law, think again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I am well aware of the existence of the same type of idiots in the Christian world. They seem to be increasing their control recently too!</p>

<p>I am not really trying to bait you, but to say that some other people clearly have ideas/systems of thought/beliefs that are incompatable with modern life (like the fundamentalist Christians).</p>

<p>When you throw language into the mix, it gets worse. Many of concepts of Western civilization simple have no translation in many of these languages. Even when a translation word exists, the reality of the system has not permeated into their cultures (look at Saudi&#39;s public stoneings etc.)</p>

<p>You seem to think that they will get mellowed out with exposure, while I think they will react like the Jehova&#39;s and try to take control of the government/legal system...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your opinion has always mattered. I&#39;d frame it more like some aren&#39;t yet ready to listen.  Nor, can we force them too.</p>

<p>When all things are disclosed and the truth is known there will still be those folks who choose to see the same things they&#39;ve habitually seen for years and years. Whether due to them growing too comfortable with the way things have become or denial and they refuse to allow the understanding that there is this much corruption in the place that has been marketed to everyone as the greatest country on the planet.  </p>

<p>I can&#39;t help but think that part of what your saying is exactly what they want. You doubting yourself or being overly critical on yourself because you&#39;ve chosen the path of a critical thinker by not just accepting everything that you are told.  </p>

<p>Keep doubting man. Dont stop asking why or how come?  Once you start silencing your opinions because what others might think is exactly what they wished would happen when the term &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; was coined.

I&#39;ve been trying to wake up my friends. I give up. It&#39;s pointless. And I don&#39;t care what people think of me in regards to all this corruption because I&#39;ve been sharing stuff for over 3 years now. I&#39;ve been called crazy, delusional, schizophrenic, I watch too many movies/television etc. I&#39;ve dealt with it. It hurt at first. Especially after being told all my life how smart I am and how honest and trustworthy I am. A lot of my family has distanced themselves from me, I&#39;m definitely the black sheep of the family now. So I give up. Hillary will be our next president. Been telling people that on Facebook for over three years, and it&#39;s like, I&#39;ve been right about so much stuff, but it doesn&#39;t matter. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, and this is just an opinion but anything having to do with Facebook and I usually stop listening anyway. </p>

<p>Sure, Facebook is a way to communicate.  Is it the best way to communicate unpopular opinion or alternative ideas? Probably not. You might be somewhat causing your segregation because of that.</p>

<p>People who eventually start seeing through the illusion or questioning it seek look at alternative news sites and  chat boards.  They research their ideas and poke around with like minded folks.  Those are great places to talk and discuss things.</p>

<p>Trying to awaken people through Facebook is like being an actor performing a monologue on stage with a bunch of other actors who are also performing on that same stage using different monologues, all at the same time.  The actor getting butt-hurt when the audience doesn&#39;t give them a standing ovation isn&#39;t fair to the people they are trying to reach.  Theres to much other noise going on to isolate and want to pay attention to anything they aren&#39;the already interested in.</p>

<p>Like I said you can&#39;take make people listen if they don&#39;t want to.  Being preachy or trying to push an agenda over and over again just doesn&#39;t get the job done usually either.</p>

<p>Communicate with folks about it casually and in person.  You have a better chance of reaching people if they have the option of listening and can have things related to them in a personal manner.  Just don&#39;t make it your prime directive every time you speak with people.  Life and connections with people should be your first priority.  Otherwise your talking AT not TO them.</p>

<p>Good job deleting the Facebook man. That thing ruins people&#39;s lives.  Be good man and be patient your time will come.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason they have never &#39;slipped up&#39; before now in my opinion is because of technology that is readily available. Of those 150 years of rigged elections you mentioned, there has only been a small fraction where people are able to hack and find out information about the government, perhaps a reason for why they are being outed. Interesting idea though </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would believe that these &quot;higher powers&quot; HAVE to be really educated and cautious to get away with these things. If they were inbred, after 1 generation, it would literally be a coin toss between somewhat Normal or completely defective. Make it through another generation and it&#39;s almost certainly guaranteed birth defects. If these people who are in control of everything are stupid enough to inbreed, then I think it&#39;s impossible for them to be where they are today. Stupid people wouldn&#39;t control the world so easily. It&#39;s really easy to imagine a circular table with 8 pig shaped men dressed in table cloth surrounding a pentagram. Buttttttt realistically TPTB is just all the most influential people in the world who communicate with each other rarely and each own their own piece of the pie, if you will. </p>

<p>I&#39;m new to r/conspiracy so when I read things i take it with a grain of salt as should everyone. The shit people believe with ZERO evidence is astounding. But that being said I do believe in things like DNC being the biggest scam in existence and how they control the media (really evident). 9/11 being faked, I think maybe, but that is still a huuuugggee assumption (that would mean TPTB are 110% sociopathic). But if they could get away with 9/11, why not get away with something easier like assassinating trump or Putin etc.. I would say getting away with 9/11 would mean they got away with the hardest crime there is, so assassinating trump is a walk in the park. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, this is what I&#39;ve been saying over a year now, I&#39;m glad others are seeing it. The CIA is good at capturing revolutionary momentum to use to install new governments, it has overthrown 53 governments since the end of WW2. I think it sees a natural revolution coming up, and is trying to capture the momentum of it by controlling the messaging and ideology of the revolutionaries, through the media. </p>

<p>You no doubt were targeted right at the start, because you&#39;re pointing out an uncomfortable truth. </p>

<p>They are not slipping up, they are showing everyone how bullshit everything is and trying to create this revolution that they will control. They did it just in the last 5 years in Egypt, Libya, Syria, Ukraine... It&#39;s coming home to roost. </p>

<p>They see what&#39;s in the cards. They can&#39;t fix things. There&#39;s going to be some sort of outburst at somepoint or a revolution or something, it just seems like the path we&#39;re locked on to.

    <div class="md"><p>To be completely honest with you, Rob Ford did a lot of good for Toronto, he was kinda like Trump, independently rich, with his own agenda and didn&#39;t care about pay offs or fighting for the rich guy, he was with the regular guy. He was also very nice, his brother Dougs a bit of a fuck, but Rob was usually a pretty kind hearted soul... Yes, there was that whole crack thing, and it was hilarious, and yes I read the paper daily just to see what bullshit he was up to. We also had Harper, about as well liked as Bush Jr was, now we have a heart throb as a Prime Minister... And the least liked politician in history Kathleen Wynne as our Premiere with something like an 8% approval rating... Yet somehow she just keeps getting in.... Our politics are just as fucked, I agree.... Yours are more interesting though. But Rob Ford, he was at least a good guy. (Not saying Trump is, but that&#39;s who is compare him to) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think they are anticipating some kind of revolution because of the things they are doing, and they have been preparing to shift our government towards a police state by creating situations that allow things like the TSA to be instituted, along with various forms of surveillance to watch our every move. The biggest thing is influencing public opinion on gun control laws so that it&#39;s more difficult for people to get weapons, and they have a record of everyone who has weapons so they know who is a threat. They are trying to undo a law that was put into place by the Founding Fathers because the Founding Fathers foresaw the possibility that something like what is happening right now could happen. The 2nd Amendment exists for this exact reason and they are tricking people into giving up that right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting ideas, I think you&#39;ve got some of the right puzzle pieces, but aren&#39;t putting them together properly yet.</p>

<p>Reddit has simply lost control of their platform, and they don&#39;t have the resources or talent they need to understand what is happening in real time. I&#39;ve met Steve Huffman at Reddit meetups in person and talked to him about this, that&#39;s the reality of the situation.</p>

<p>Google absolutely is rigging the election, and its proven. They likely support an one world government.</p>

<p>Personally, I think Trump is legit running for President. He&#39;s just an old misogynist possibly racist white alpha male entrepreneur who saw what the globalists were doing to the country he loved and decided to fight it. But of course, he also has a huge ego, and some serious character flaws. </p>

<p>Wikileaks is just doing what Assange does, and is just a puzzle piece. Someone dumped this on their lap, and they were happy to release the files, especially considering Clinton tried to kill Assange with a drone strike.</p>

<p>Anonymous is a bunch of freedom loving pirates, and hackers. Progressives, libertarians, the outcasts, etc. They have no leader or organization so its hard to say much about their intentions. Classifying them as a single entity doesn&#39;t even really make sense.</p>

<p>Clinton is clearly for a one world government, and perhaps even wants to lead it.</p>

<p>Russia just wants to hang on to its sovereignty, and is willing to defend itself if necessary, and wants no part in a one world government. They&#39;re currently being setup as being the fall guy for any number of conflicts and being used as propaganda against the American public to create doubt in the results of the election. Which is why they&#39;re using the media to paint Trump literally as the next Hitler, so even if Clinton loses they can try and contest the election. If Hillary even makes it to the election, the whole damn thing might be canceled before it even happens.</p>

<p>You&#39;re also forgetting China, Japan, Vietnam, North Korea, and that whole region which is also a mess.</p>

<p>Then there is the middle east, Syria, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran, and that whole mess.</p>

<p>As for the leaks, it is my personal theory the leaks are from someone within the US government. Either Seth Rich who was a data specialist for the DNC who was murdered, or someone within the NSA. The reason I believe it was an inside job is the complexity of the hack, and the fact the FBI found no evidence of intrusion from Russia or anyone else. It&#39;s likely someone within the intelligence community saw what Clinton was doing, and pulled an Edward Snowden and sent it all to Wikileaks because they were pissed at her one world order agenda, violating any number of laws, and essentially trying to end US sovereignty. That then exposed Clinton&#39;s one world government plan, which then the White House and Clinton campaign responded with a propaganda war against the US people, against Trump, the Russians, etc. That way the election can be canceled, or if it is held the results can be contested because of &quot;Russian hacking&quot;, and then martial law could be imposed after an uprising which will likely be trigged by various false flags and psyops.</p>

<p>The problem is I don&#39;t think the Clinton camp or even the White House realized the gravity of what Wikileaks had, and the people have woken up just enough. </p>

<p>At this point anything could happen, and all we can do is watch, collect more evidence, information, and keep talking to each other about whats going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The US empire is bankrupt and yet the dollar,  as formally the British Pound, (even during the last days of British Empire)  is still the strongest currency.    The goal of the elites is to jump the sinking ship like rats when they have to,  but to ride out their corruption as long as they can,  so the corruption in heroin,  medical scams,  wall street scams,  etc. ( and selling state secrets) will persist as long as it can,  with the help of the owned media.</p>

<p>The poor of America are as incidental to them as the poor anywhere else in the world.    The corporate plantation is based on market share,  globally,  which is enforced by the military where possible.   Those with half decent jobs will kiss rich assholes ass as long as they can keep getting new car leases every 3 years and send their kids to elite colleges.    So,  the revolution will only happen when the US has 60% unemployment.    At that point, it will be irrelevant,  the elites will have moved to Dubai,  Singapore,  etc.    The poor who can&#39;t afford to leave will have to sort out for themselves a new way.    Slackers will have to work too,   no work,  no food.</p>

I suspect a giant convenience now that the shenanigan(g)s of printing money to explore shale oil and gas is finished just by sheer thermodynamics and the willingness of regulator to look away is depleted, a chaotic environment where sudden savings suck out money of circulation prevent the long anticipated inflation. If the US lowers energy consumption further with prices around 40$/bl, they will crack oil producing nations across the globe for good. </p>

<p>Really? Citizens have a lot of guns, but most are short on training... If the government could be overthrown by citizens I think it would take a lot longer than that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Soldiers would definitely defy orders. Not all of them but a large percentage. As the ranks fell, the equipment and knowledge would go with them as well. Is Obama gonna be the one mowing down civilians in an Apache? Although comical to think, and as much as he&#39;d enjoy that, there needs to be skilled soldiers ready to do the deed. I&#39;d assume many would defect.</p>

<p>1) Don&#39;t do anything= Governments get more and more draconian and Orwellian. NWO</p>

<p>2) Do something= Revolution maybe? Start a whole new &quot;better&quot; system? NWO.</p>

<p>Edit: best solution is to believe on Christ.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We had Marion Barry. One of the first viral things I remember on the internet was a list of Marion Barry quotes, which I was dismayed to learn he actually said almost none if.  I think he was supposed to be a good guy early on. A lot of them are early on. It&#39;s just a very dirty game. Also running DC is probably a bit stranger than running a similar sized city that doesn&#39;t happen to be the nation&#39;s capital. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your opinion has always mattered. I&#39;d frame it more like some aren&#39;t yet ready to listen.  Nor, can we force them too.</p>

<p>When all things are disclosed and the truth is known there will still be those folks who choose to see the same things they&#39;ve habitually seen for years and years. Whether due to them growing too comfortable with the way things have become or denial and they refuse to allow the understanding that there is this much corruption in the place that has been marketed to everyone as the greatest country on the planet.  </p>

<p>I can&#39;t help but think that part of what your saying is exactly what they want. You doubting yourself or being overly critical on yourself because you&#39;ve chosen the path of a critical thinker by not just accepting everything that you are told.  </p>

<p>Keep doubting man. Dont stop asking why or how come?  Once you start silencing your opinions because what others might think is exactly what they wished would happen when the term &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; was coined.  (saw a post on here in the last couple days about its origins actually)</p>
