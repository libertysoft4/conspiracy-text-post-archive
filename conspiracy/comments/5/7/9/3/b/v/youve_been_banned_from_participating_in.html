<p>subreddit message via <a href="/r/offmychest">/r/offmychest</a>[M] sent 16 minutes ago</p>

<p>You have been banned from participating in <a href="/r/offmychest">/r/offmychest</a>. You can still view and subscribe to <a href="/r/offmychest">/r/offmychest</a>, but you won&#39;t be able to post or comment.
Note from the moderators:</p>

<p>You have been automatically banned for participating in a &quot;safe place for people who hate Muslims&quot;. <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> systemically harasses individuals and communities, including this one. An overwhelming majority of subreddits in this list have already been &quot;&quot;quarantined&quot;&quot; or banned by Reddit.</p>

<p>Content and activity you provide to the hatereddit harms this community due to Reddit&#39;s algorithms and breaks our rules. We are willing to reverse the ban only if you will completely disengage from these hatereddits. If you will not immediately cooperate with our rules, then do not contact us; we will ignore any other response.
If you have a question regarding your ban, you can contact the moderator team for <a href="/r/offmychest">/r/offmychest</a> by replying to this message.</p>

<p>Reminder from the Reddit staff: If you use another account to circumvent this subreddit ban, that will be considered a violation of the Content Policy and can result in your account being suspended from the site as a whole.</p>

<p>There are actually mods who ban you from their sub because you happen to be subscribed to another subreddit they don&#39;t like? A sub that&#39;s totally unrelated? The sub for one of our presidential candidates?</p>

<p>That&#39;s the most ridiculous bullshit I&#39;ve ever heard of! (not your post, them banning you.)</p>

<p>How did they even know? Did you just happen to mention <a href="/r/the_Donald">/r/the_Donald</a> or did they find out from going through your comments?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I may have posted a comment to <a href="/r/offmychest">/r/offmychest</a> once and may have subscribed - not sure. So, that act alone put me on their watch list. They started to monitor my future behavior and as soon as I posted a couple of things at <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a>, they auto-banned me. It was not my subscription but my posting to it. I do not think I explicitly subscribed.</p>

<p>Creepy shit. They have all of my post history and they have been deciding what to do with me based on my post all this time.</p>

<p>First it is getting auto-banned. Next thing would be ... an automatic drone strike?</p>

<p>What the hell does that even mean? How could you posting to the_donald <em>harm</em> their sub?</p>

<p>It&#39;s total fucking bullshit that they&#39;re referring to the_donald as a &quot;hatereddit&quot; like it&#39;s a sub for the KKK or Nazis. There&#39;s plenty of dicks there but there&#39;s also plenty of dicks in the Hillary subs and Politics. Do they automatically ban everyone subscribed to those subs as well? I fucking doubt it.</p>

<p>The fact you weren&#39;t even a big supporter of Trump before they banned you is even more hilarious and ironic. By automatically assuming anyone subscribed there is a racist asshole, they swayed a possible undecided voter to the person they&#39;re trying to beat.</p>

<p>I actually don&#39;t know to say. It&#39;s mind boggling to me that they think this is somehow ok?</p>

<p>Also, it&#39;s hilarious to me that they&#39;re the one banning &quot;hatereddit&quot; users while <em>they</em> sit on their high horse, discriminate against Trump supporters, and act way more hateful than most people in the_donald.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It can be pretty shitty to be a woman on Reddit sometimes too, but just for being a woman. Everytime I mention I&#39;m a woman, where it&#39;s relevant information for the post or discussion, there&#39;s always a pretty good chance I&#39;ll have at least one douchebag mock me for mentioning my gender. </p>

<p>Always pretty horrible in comment sections of posts about women not going to jail, women getting children in custody battles, divorce in general, or false rape accusations. </p>

<p>I know it might sound stupid, but sometimes I&#39;ll read hundreds of really awful comments about how absolutely evil we are, how you shouldn&#39;t get married because your wife will want/probably get all your money when she inevitably cheats on you and how you should always get a paternity test done even if you&#39;re in a loving, happy family because chances are your wife is a lying slut, etc. And it&#39;ll legitimately make me worried that a lot of guys think like this now, which makes me even more worried because I&#39;m single. I don&#39;t want to be alone forever, but I&#39;d be absolutely crushed if my partner thought the same things dudes on Reddit do.</p>

<p>Can definitely be <em>really</em> misogynistic here.</p>

<p>Yeah, it definitely does seem that way sometimes, but then I remember that I&#39;m a woman and don&#39;t consider myself a SJW.</p>

<p>It&#39;s actually really weird to me. My entire life, I&#39;ve always been on what most people would consider the &quot;far left.&quot; And I definitely still am, especially considering what passes as &quot;left&quot; nowadays. But it&#39;s strange to me how these people can consider themselves liberal or social justice anything while at the same time, being authoritarian dickheads.</p>

<p>No clue how they think they&#39;re helping anything at all by using censorship instead of well reasoned arguments or discussions.</p>
