    <div class="md"><p>Afghanistan. I had enough food and water to last one day, the clothes I was wearing, my weapon and some ammunition. Luckily it was during early fall and it never dropped below freezing. The mission didn&#39;t go as planned and we were unable to be resupplied and/or extracted so we were forced to stay where we were forced days with nothing.</p>

<p>The human body is resilient. You can survive for quite a while with next to nothing. Yes once mother nature decides to shit on your parade you need shelter, but if It&#39;s above freezing and there&#39;s little to no severe weather, you can get by with little or none.</p>

<p>Things to look for (if you have the extra funds): </p>

<p>Water wicking clothing</p>

<p>Military poncho liner</p>

<p>The Ranger Handbook</p>

<p>Small Unit Leader&#39;s Guide to 
Mountain Warfare Operations (Marine Corps)</p>

<p>Platypus or other small group water filtration system</p>

<p>Those are some basic items that will do wonders for you. Aside from that like everyone else has said use the survivalist forums, but make sure to look for people with experience. There&#39;s a lot of people talking out of their ass.</p>

<p>yes i survive outside for more than three hours

<p>i think you are the one being daft. or perhaps you are thinking of alaska where conditions are a little rougher.</p>

<p>are you actually claiming you cannot survive 3 hours without shelter, under normal daytime conditions.</p>

<p>Not once did I claim that. I said mildly extreme conditions. This is about survival, not your power going out for an hour or so, nor about working outside. You are missing the point of the info graph. How it can be downvoted and you debating me this, is amazing. You do you, homie. YOLO. I only offered some wisdom. I hope you don&#39;t find yourself in a situation, where this may SAVE YOUR FUCKIN&#39; life. Whatever... Peace.The.Fuck.Out.</p>

<p>And if it goes worse from there, then it&#39;s a focus on locations of significant strategic or economic value. So mostly military bases, international airports, ports or other similar logistical hubs. (Not to mention things like large airport runways make a nice visual bullseye marker from over a mile up.) If you&#39;re out in the boonies, you&#39;ll probably not see much of a threat like a large city would. Your only worry then would be fallout from being downwind, and potentially being mobbed by survivors as things may be quite lawless at that point.</p>

<p>If you can make it 40mi from something you think is a likely target within the possible 10 minute warning (if not there already), then perhaps you can make it to the next stage of the game. Given how bad it could get, some might think you&#39;d be better off going to ground zero instead.</p>

<p>Playing with the nukemap that&#39;s on the web and picking out the most likely targets (multiple mode) like I suggested (instead of just downtown), would probably give a good idea.</p>
