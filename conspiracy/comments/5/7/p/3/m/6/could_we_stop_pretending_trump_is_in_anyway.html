His handlers at Breitbart know what this movement hates Clinton more than anyone else and knows what you want to hear. it is unbelievably clear that couldn&#39;t care less about any of this, he is just an egomaniac who wants to win to protect  his ridiculously fragile ego.</p>

<p>The only thing that separates him from the people who run things is that he is a complete and utter moron. He is closer to the puppet dictators put in place, which it was leaked long ago is exactly what he told his VP (that they would run the show and he would be the puppet). </p>

<p>To throw the weight of this movement behind someone who has completely redefined how dishonest a politician can be is an enormous detriment to the movement and reaffirms many people&#39;s belief that the whole movement is living in a dream world with Alex Jones completely divorced from reality.</p>

<p>I like this sub because it doesn&#39;t feel like it&#39;s anyone&#39;s personal vendetta but everyone is just searching for the truth behind the mainstream. Accusing the people of here being biased against Hillary just goes to show how despicable and hidden her agenda is.</p>

<p>I was banned from 2xchromosomes for calling bill clinton out on his rape shenanigans. The problem with the left is that they CAN simultaneously hold two contradictory ideas in their brains and have no problem what so ever with being hypocritical about it. This is why you can&#39;t debate the left. Their ideology is not secular.... it is religious. They believe in what they say and hear, not because it&#39;s objectively true or verifiable but because they WANT it to be true. </p>

<p>Donald trump grabbing a pussy? EVIL RACIST SEXIST MISOGYNIST. Bill Clinton abusing his office to rape multiple women? Water under the bridge please stay on topic its not hillary&#39;s fault she din do nuffin. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>YES. There are very few policy stances on which I agree with Trump. In fact I don&#39;t agree with most of them.</p>

<p>But by him hammering his anti-Clinton stance, he is also smart enough to try and rope in the Berners or at the very least, get them to vote third party.</p>

<p>Clinton completely took this constituency for granted (in fact it&#39;s pretty clear she actively hates this voting block), and has merely assumed they&#39;d vote for her once she cinched the nom. She did this even after shitting on the supporters and the delegates in his favor, and holding a dirty campaign. To me, Clinton holding this arrogant assumption that she&#39;d just sweep up Berners post-nom was a huge mistake. Trump is capitalizing on it.</p>

<p>And I don&#39;t want to sound self-important as a Bernie supporter, but they represented almost half of all Dem votes cast (more, if you&#39;re cynical and believe Clinton rigged the vote). </p>

<p>If you&#39;re the Republican nom, you&#39;d be blind not to realize that if you can get a chunk of former Sanders supporters to either vote for him OR get them to vote for anyone but Clinton, you stand a good chance of winning.</p>

<p>Trump&#39;s intentions may not be the purely to &#39;save everyone&#39;, but even if it&#39;s just to save himself as long as he saves other people with them that&#39;s certainly better than the dystopian nightmare proposed by hillary and crew. </p>

<p>This is the most comical part of your post. THERE IS NO CONSPIRACY MOVEMENT...unless...perhaps...it would qualify as a conspiracy that there is one ;)</p>

<p>We are in this sub for various reasons, most having nothing to do with Trump. I do not deny most of what you said about Trump and yawn...so what...do you mean that Hillary is a &quot;better&quot; choice?

    <div class="md"><p>Its a reality show brother. Humanity was programmed to have a dualistic nature.  Me vs You. Us vs Them. Coke or Pepsi.. Paper or Plastic.  Its everywhere you look.   Two choices, pick one.  As long as they control the two choices, it doesn&#39;t matter who wins.  Alex Jones shilling for him should be enough for most to see beyond the veil.  Consider this:   You can believe in all possibilities,  you do not need to make a choice.  There is an infinite variety in the gray area between.  To vote one or the other is to participate in a corrupted and destructive system that has never represented or helped you.  </p>

<p>If trump WAS a threat to the globalist agenda or control structure, he would be ignored and they would put someone in his place tomorrow.  The only reason they didn&#39;t like him in the first place is because he was not brought up through the traditional selection process which is darker than most can imagine.  So instead,  they can just control him with some far more advanced MK-Ultra like program the moment after he is sworn in. </p>

<p>we do not live in the kind of country where a tweet can get you two thousand lashings, but it&#39;s getting close.</p>

<p>however, you may find it rather difficult to convince other people of your idea&#39;s merit if the strongest part of your argument is calling them an idiot for their beliefs. you may find that a lot of us in this community are very open to ideas as long as they&#39;re provided with some kind of metrics grasp onto.</p>

<p>I have seen, with my own eyes, the metrics that are in the Wikileaks, for example. I am able to see, and through critical thinking means, realize that I was being played by the DNC. this is coming from someone who has been a liberal all of my Life, voted for Obama twice, voted for Bernie California primary.</p>

<p>in the process of arriving at your reasoning, with regards to &#39;how hard the community is being played&#39;, have you ever considered how maybe your community is being played by the same methods? have you seriously considered why the other candidate needs literal Army of Internet trolls to AstroTurf and correct the record? does that make you feel like you&#39;re being played?</p>

<p>I am by no means trying to come down on you. I&#39;m legitimately curious about the epistemology of your reasoning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anything is better then HRC, period. I say give the guy a chance. He is not a career politician, he is not going to play games with terrorists like Obama and Bush. You act like we have a choice. We all know politicians are all corrupt. Some may ask, what does it matter?</p>

<p>It matters because Trump is independently wealthy and NOT a career politician. That&#39;s why it is so important for TPTB make him lose. Well, that and TPP won&#39;t pass if Trump is around. The money they are dumping into this election would be a drop in the bucket compared to what they are going to bring in with TPP, TISA and others. </p>

<p>Why wouldn&#39;t the Republican party be putting any money toward Trump&#39;s campaign? That&#39;s the real, very telling question.</p>

<p>The lovely thing about theories, they need no proof. Once there is proof, it&#39;s no longer a theory. It&#39;s the truth. There are very talented and enlightened minds that engage this sub. I am more then honored and humbled to share my thoughts with such people. Thank you all. To call or imply any true contributer to this sub stupid or gullible is telling, OP. Your going to have to work on your subtly.</p>
