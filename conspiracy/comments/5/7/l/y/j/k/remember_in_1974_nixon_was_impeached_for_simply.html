    <div class="md"><p>Yeah received a pardon basically so the country could get past it all. We were dealing with a lot of bullshit trying to get out of Vietnam, the country didnt need to have a giant trial thats viewed on an international stage of the disgraced former pres that resigned. We needed to just move past it. What Nixon did was obviously wrong, but I agree with Ford pardoning him. Nixon became a recluse and rarely spoke to the media ever again until he died. Did no one any harm by being pardoned, but if he wasn&#39;t pardoned it could&#39;ve done a lot of harm to the US on an international level.</p>

<p>With that being said, Hillary doesn&#39;t deserve any pardoning, she&#39;s well beyond that. She deserves a cell.</p>

<p>If the US had actually prosecuted Nixon, it would have garnered far more respect than giving the whole issue a whitewash. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Did no one any harm by being pardoned</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Consider the precedent Nixon&#39;s pardon set. He went to his grave without admitting any wrongdoing. The US was supposed to be a country founded on law. Nixon put paid to that lie. </p>

<p>It&#39;s worth mentioning that Hillary&#39;s first job for the government was as part of the legal staff for the House Judiciary Committee as they considered Nixon&#39;s impeachment. Hillary&#39;s job required her to listen to Nixon&#39;s tapes. Her favorite were his &quot;tapes of tapes&quot; - where Nixon would record himself listening to previously tapes, while 
explaining what he meant, and how his words should be interpreted. </p>

<p>If Nixon had faced the full consequences for his actions, Hillary would have learned a much different lesson than &quot;it depends on what the meaning of &#39;is&#39; is&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How is that a &quot;moronic narrative&quot; ? lol. Obviously its a subjective moment in history, but when considering other similar moments in history in other countries in the past, it is likely this is why it was done. I have a bachelors degree in history; one of my professor&#39;s who has written several books on the time period and has a doctorate in history was the one who &quot;pushed that moronic narrative&quot; to us in class. Im not saying its absolutely correct, but when considering other factors it is a pretty close guess to why it was done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t disagree with your last point, but I still will agree with my opinion that pardoning him was necessary for the country at the time because 1974 in the US was a time where we were immersed in controversy dealing with the Civil Rights movement that just ended, the Vietnam War, and the oil crisis. Our country needed not to pile onto the bullshit, but rather to move on. But, thats only my historical opinion on the matter where I am comparing it to past historical events </p>

<p>The person they wiretapped used to work for Howard Hughes in the fifties when Nixon was Vice President under Eisenhower, and Nixon was nervous because he was working for the DNC.  Nixon wanted to know if this person was spilling secrets about events that occurred between 1959 and 1964.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My thought is that producing food/water/other necessities in your backyard or in a public space is about the most subversive thing you can do at this point. As the &quot;recovery&quot; continues to grind away at peoples&#39; ability to get by, you can trade or share with your neighbors. If you have skills, consider trading your time for things that you need; barter is untaxable. As the economy continues to deteriorate, there will be more idle people in need. By looking out for ourselves and our neighbors, we can break the myth that government (in its current form) is necessary. Cheers and good luck!</p>

And on top of that we wage war on drugs and poverty which has incarcerated the larges percentage of any country&#39;s population in the entire world and breeds cartels and gangs and endless death.</p>

<p>Ignorance is Strength - check. We no longer teach our children even a quarter of what was taught to the founding fathers in their youth.  We don&#39;t teach Latin and Greek and we have adults who cannot even balance a check book or pick out their state on a map.</p>

<p>Freedom is Slavery - back to my incarceration comments. Everything is illegal now and confusing. And with NDAA if they decide you are a terrorist you cease to exist.</p>

<p>1984&#39;s protagonist had a job rewriting history daily.  Have you seen a public school text book recently? Do you see how MSM fawns over Clinton and ignores her constant criminal acts?  Fraud and perjury?  Do you forget how they scrubbed Obama&#39;s past off the Internet? How they spin narratives and tour talk shows to propagate?</p>

<p>And he ran afoul of the Ministry of Truth... our very own NSA and CIA combined with FBI.  Thought police? We aren&#39;t too far from that either.  Torture? Well they deny water boarding, sleep deprivation, sound and lighg assault are torture and yet we all know they are psychologically.  But it&#39;s gotta be done to save is from the terrorists... that our govt creates.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make a very compelling point. 1984 also engaged in psychological torture and warfare very much so. Beyond the obvious propaganda (of which we are bombarded by daily. So much so we can&#39;t even also identify it all the time and some can&#39;t at all). But towards the end of the book</p>

<p>[Spoilers ahead just in case anyone hasn&#39;t read it yet]</p>

<p>When they imprison Winston and he starts his talks with O&#39;Brien about the true nature of reality, they force him to believe what they believe. To alter his mind so to him, his past crimes are inexcusable and he wants to be punished. Or tried to do so, at very least. Forcing him to wage psychological warfare upon himself, even so far as view O&#39;Brien as his loved friend as well as his torturer. Like some kind of Godhead-figure. We don&#39;t do this on that scale, because it&#39;s technologically difficult and hard to attempt without the right tools. But America would do that in a second if they could, sadly.</p>

<p>Also, that ending was depressing as hell in the Chestnut Inn(?). Once I read it though, all I could think was &#39;why did I expect anything else?&#39;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh but they do it with peer pressure. Not as much with Bush jr in media but definitely within his party if one questioned the Patriot Act they were no longer patriots.  Shame on you, long live Despot Bush II.</p>

<p>Now it&#39;s leaps and bounds worse.  With Obama they could label any dissent as disgusting racism and bigotry.  He is the Teflon president.  Nothing he does wrong is ever held to account and even a full Republican held congress hesitates ro stand against him at all.  When a few do they are harshly belittled and even their own party yanks them down or distances themselves.  Our PC world guarantees a minority or female or both as POTUS can literally get away with anything. Hilbeast has already been getting away with everything and her in the Oval Office is Armageddon coming.  Not that I think Trump is a real opponent or viable option... he is a foil to make her the less bitter pill.  Doesn&#39;t matter the votes will go same as the DNC this election and RNC last with voters hijacked, masses of dead people voting and no one getting arrested despite boasting to a news crew they voted 6 times for Obama.</p>

<p>Peer pressure can be so intense when you know you are in a room of rabid politician worshipers and decide maybe for an unsinged hide you can grow to love their human god too.  Or at least pretend.</p>

<p>I have no doubts with the right psychological torture, alternated with care and compassion and drugged states while horribly sleep deprived we could all be reprogrammed.  But for now keeping the narrative spinning 24/7 and carefully created distractions they keep us in line.</p>

<p>We who refuse to be sheep get cut from the herd and ostracized as long as we aren&#39;t a real threat.  Then we slaughter ourselves with strange ODs, freakish car accidents and suicides.  RIP Michael Hastings</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you.  This is what I&#39;ve been saying for several months now.  In 1972-1974 it was the Babyboom generation that stood up to Nixon and led the nation-wide groundswell of anger against Nixon&#39;s cover-up of the investigation into the Watergate burglary.  Now many of these same liberal Babyboomers have abandoned their ethical and moral values in supporting the cover-up perpetrated by the Obama administration (FBI and Justice Department) and Hillary Clinton of Hillary&#39;s illegal use of a private email server when she was Secretary of State.  This is the shame of the Babyboom generation.</p>

<p>Ditto the shameful cooperation of the Hillary cover-up perpetrated by the liberal media elites, led by none other than the Washington Post and the New York Times.  It was the Washington Post and New York times who published the <em>leaked</em> documents, The Pentagon Papers, which is what triggered Nixon&#39;s &#39;White House Plumbers&#39; into committing burglaries and acts of &#39;dirty tricks&#39; in 1971 and 1972.  And of course it was the reporting by Washington Post reporters Woodward and Bernstein that led to the disclosure of the cover-up of the Watergate burglary.  I am dismayed that these papers are ignoring the leaked emails that demonstrate that both Clinton and Obama have lied about the details of Hillary&#39;s illegal use of her private email servers.  Worse of all, the Washington Post actually has editorialized that there should not be any further reportage of the email scandal, or, presumably, follow-up investigation of the information that is contained in the leaked emails.  (What do Woodward and Bernstein think of this?)</p>

<p>Fortunately, many people from the younger generations, those who backed Bernie Sanders for instance, are correctly outraged by Hillary&#39;s actions and they aren&#39;t buying into Hillary&#39;s moral and ethical sellout.</p>

<p>but since she didn&#39;t &quot;mean to&quot; he decided not to press forward with a prosecution. BTW, intent doesn&#39;t matter when it comes to prosecuting for a crime but that was Comey&#39;s excuse to stop her from being prosecuted, not that there wasn&#39;t evidence of her crimes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read the BBC articles and it summarized many of the emails I already read. They are gossipy and sometimes reveal insider strategy(the &#39;what position should I take on an issue to get maximum effect&#39;) but there is nothing too nefarious in there. Her commitment to opposing TPP has always been an open question and is unlikely to be minimized by telling a bunch of banksters that she wants free flowing labor and capital across the hemisphere. </p>

<p>The most damaging emails, IMO, are still the DNC ones where they were discussing how to harm Sanders&#39; campaign. It&#39;s not criminal for the DNC to take sides but it&#39;s a really shitty thing to do and it&#39;s terrible for party unity. </p>

<p>Did you know Nixon&#39;s VP was Spiro Agnew and Ford only came only later, and that Ford was involved in the Warren commission?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make a very compelling point. 1984 also engaged in psychological torture and warfare very much so. Beyond the obvious propaganda (of which we are bombarded by daily. So much so we can&#39;t even also identify it all the time and some can&#39;t at all). But towards the end of the book</p>

<p>[Spoilers ahead just in case anyone hasn&#39;t read it yet]</p>

<p>When they imprison Winston and he starts his talks with O&#39;Brien about the true nature of reality, they force him to believe what they believe. To alter his mind so to him, his past crimes are inexcusable and he wants to be punished. Or tried to do so, at very least. Forcing him to wage psychological warfare upon himself, even so far as view O&#39;Brien as his loved friend as well as his torturer. Like some kind of Godhead-figure. We don&#39;t do this on that scale, because it&#39;s technologically difficult and hard to attempt without the right tools. But America would do that in a second if they could, sadly.</p>

<p>Also, that ending was depressing as hell in the Chestnut Inn(?). Once I read it though, all I could think was &#39;why did I expect anything else?&#39;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh but they do it with peer pressure. Not as much with Bush jr in media but definitely within his party if one questioned the Patriot Act they were no longer patriots.  Shame on you, long live Despot Bush II.</p>

<p>Now it&#39;s leaps and bounds worse.  With Obama they could label any dissent as disgusting racism and bigotry.  He is the Teflon president.  Nothing he does wrong is ever held to account and even a full Republican held congress hesitates ro stand against him at all.  When a few do they are harshly belittled and even their own party yanks them down or distances themselves.  Our PC world guarantees a minority or female or both as POTUS can literally get away with anything. Hilbeast has already been getting away with everything and her in the Oval Office is Armageddon coming.  Not that I think Trump is a real opponent or viable option... he is a foil to make her the less bitter pill.  Doesn&#39;t matter the votes will go same as the DNC this election and RNC last with voters hijacked, masses of dead people voting and no one getting arrested despite boasting to a news crew they voted 6 times for Obama.</p>

<p>Peer pressure can be so intense when you know you are in a room of rabid politician worshipers and decide maybe for an unsinged hide you can grow to love their human god too.  Or at least pretend.</p>

<p>I have no doubts with the right psychological torture, alternated with care and compassion and drugged states while horribly sleep deprived we could all be reprogrammed.  But for now keeping the narrative spinning 24/7 and carefully created distractions they keep us in line.</p>

<p>We who refuse to be sheep get cut from the herd and ostracized as long as we aren&#39;t a real threat.  Then we slaughter ourselves with strange ODs, freakish car accidents and suicides.  RIP Michael Hastings</p>
