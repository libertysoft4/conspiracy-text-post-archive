        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>it&#39;s probably a good idea if i just write this down.</p>

<p>so i have been reading about John Todd. he claims to be ex-illuminati moriah wind. he is also a Collins.</p>

<p>he might be a disinformant and the whole stuff is a honeypot sting. or not. or even a false flag. you decide.</p>

<p>what i want to point out in this thread is about one of his speech about the demon hierarchy.</p>

<p>so lucifer or satan is said to be the most perfect creation god ever created. probably also the first creature god ever made.</p>

<p>in islam, god is called the creator, but god is not a creature. this is probably because god doesn&#39;t have a body or physical form. but the devil does. that&#39;s why he is called a creature.</p>

<p>i understand your brain will pop reading all this stuff. so take it easy. lay back, take a deep breath, in case you are not used to this kind of stuff. eat a sandwich and drink a can of beer while watching your favorite TV series (which is of course satanic mind control too).</p>

<p>then go to sleep for an entire year, and come back here if you are ready.</p>

<p>satan is said to be the most beautiful and wise of all of god&#39;s creation. he is also god&#39;s chosen angel. god&#39;s right hand. his second in command.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but i think god is also rather gender neutral, since he doesn&#39;t have a physical form. in case you are a feminist, it is also OK if you refer god as a she.</p>

<p>which is probably also true for lucifer. he can appear as a male or female.
although he is also known as the red dragon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>so it&#39;s probably a good idea not to underestimate how smart the devil is. since he is said to be the most wise of god&#39;s creation.</p>

<p>lucifer is not a demon, he is an angel. John also said that the jews are more in depth about angelology than chistians and moslems. jews are more detailed about this.</p>

<p>so lucifer is said to be a cherubim. in islam this is known as the high angels who carry god&#39;s throne.</p>

<p>and lucifer is the main cherubim. he is called the light bearer. probably because he is the one who absorbs the most of god&#39;s light.</p>

<p>god is described as being so powerful and devastating that ordinary angels will faint if they come too close in god&#39;s presence.</p>

<p>i know this sounds like bullshit. but this is where the cherubim comes in. since they are the only ones who can get close enough to god.</p>

<p>so in christianity, satan is said to rebel because he did not want to bow toward adam. but IIRC this is not the case in islam. satan probably never rebeled. or he rebeled according to god&#39;s plan. who knows.</p>

<p>in this case, god could be the master trickster. and satan is tasked by god to test and seduce us?</p>

<p>i know this is probably just a bunch of rubbish for most people, but let me finish.</p>

<p>so, lucifer went to setup his own kingdom, mirroring the kingdom of god. it has 7 principalities.</p>

<p>also mirroring god&#39;s hierarchy, lucifer chooses his own trusted right hand. his second in command. which is beelzebub.</p>

<p>beelzebub is probably a demon, not an angel. but what do i know. beelzebub is probably also the devil. el diablo.</p>

<p>so i probably made another mistake by calling satan the devil previously.</p>

<p>and also cherubim is the plural form of cherub.</p>

<p>and it&#39;s probably not true either if somebody says god never sleeps. in fact it&#39;s the very opposite. god sleeps all the time. and this world including us, are just a part of god&#39;s dream.</p>

<p>so god is not actively involved in what happens in this world. that&#39;s why lucifer is in charge.</p>

<p>and beelzebub commands the 7 demonic principalities. probably so satan can stay in heaven?</p>

<p>the seven commands the powers. and below the powers are billions of demons. according to John Todd.</p>

<p><strong>and the 7 principalities are:</strong></p>

<p>1) Rege</p>

<blockquote>
<p>rege is the demon of occult. witchcraft and sorcery.</p>

<p>witchcraft is the practise of casting spells. and spells are probably some sort of password to incite or command demons to perform specific tasks. the demons are enslaved by the spells. which is programmed this way by satan.</p>

<p>while sorcery is said to be the art of seeing the otherside (fortune telling?) through the use of psychoactive drugs.</p>

<p>the jamaican music genre is probably also derived from this demon&#39;s name.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>2) Lazer/Larz</p>

<blockquote>
<p>this is the demon of sexual lust. including sexual perversions like pedophilia and homosexuality. etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>3) Bacchus</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the demon of addiction. heroin, cocaine, meth. smoking, alcohol. and cannabis too? no way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>4) Pan</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the demon of the mind. said to be the type of demon we encounter the most. this demon causes mental illnesses. depressions, schizophrenia, suicide, nerves and rejection.</p>

<p>this is probably why there is a spanish film called <em>&quot;Pan&#39;s Labyrinth&quot;</em>. since this demon confuses you and your mind is sometimes labyrinth like.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>5) Medit</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the demon of hate, murder, war, destruction. jealousy, envy, gossip. etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>6) Set (Seth)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the demon of death. also the name of an egyptian deity reigning the underworld.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>7) the christian demon</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i dont understand this one. it&#39;s also called the demon without a name. and evil witches don&#39;t use this demon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>so that was the 7 principalities of darkness according to John Todd.</p>

<p>but what are the original 7 principalities of god&#39;s kingdom, which satan&#39;s hierarchy was modeled after?</p>

<p><strong>the 7 kingdom of god are:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>mercy/forgiveness</li>
<li>love</li>
<li>increase/grace/altruism?</li>
<li>faith</li>
<li>authority</li>
<li>power</li>
<li>unity</li>
</ol>

<p>i don&#39;t really know myself what to make of this. but there you are. hope this turns on some lightbulb. maybe?</p>

<p>good day everyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cuz the world is fucked up? Do you not understand the amount of child sacrifice that has gone on and still goes on in the world? </p>

<p>If we were ALL fucked on this godforsaken planet because it was created by a flawed &quot;god&quot; (the demiurge, if I recall my Gnostic reading properly), and one of the ways to buy time/power is through the sacrifice of kids--maybe even your own--then perhaps the Supreme Being parachuting His own kid into things to clear out the horror isn&#39;t so far off the mark.</p>

<p>If, In the Beginning, God created the heavens and the earth and we somehow blew it and got tossed from the garden to some other place, and this other place is where we are now, created by the demiurge, why wouldn&#39;t the Real God offer us a way back? Everybody gets a second chance, a shot at forgiveness, etc. </p>

<p>All I can say is: When I go to church and pray every day to God, my life is better. The pattern of my world changes. I&#39;m more in tune, in big ways and little. I&#39;m shown examples of how I&#39;m in tune. </p>

<p>You want a crazy example? I recently bought a box set of one of my favorite musical artists. Put it on my iPod that I run with. There are 57 songs. My favorite song is #49. I started my run with that, but it&#39;s followed by a slower song, a good song but not a good song to run with. My second favorite song is like song #12, something like that. When the song I love was done, I kept running clicking backwards randomly, hoping I&#39;d find a good running song. I stopped on my second favorite song. </p>

<p>Last weekend, I went into a chain grocery store to buy a &quot;thank you&quot; card. I&#39;d been there about 15 seconds when the canned music started playing Natalie Merchant&#39;s &quot;Thank You,&quot; a song I&#39;ve not heard for maybe a half-dozen years. </p>

<p>Now, I will admit: I may just be in tune with &quot;Something.&quot; Maybe the Supreme Being is not channeled to all through Jesus Christ. But He has worked for me. He has helped me kick pot and porn and made me a nicer person, a better father and a better friend. I still slip sometimes, I still say cruel and thoughtless and cutting things to people sometimes, but far less than in years past and often I feel so rotten about doing so that I am moved to apologize (something else I never would do).</p>

<p>I can only speak for myself, but I will speak for myself. Jesus Christ is my conduit to the Divine. Perhaps there are other ways, I will not be so arrogant to claim so, though according to the Bible, Christ says so Himself. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all free will, it&#39;s up to you. Do what you want. But I thank God for Jesus Christ. If I get to heaven, and the Supreme Being tells me, &quot;Hey, look, Ian, that whole Jesus thing was just to get you on the right path, you were praying for guidance and wisdom and discipline and resilience, and in my infinite mercy and insight, I thought Jesus was the way to go for you, personally,&quot; then no harm no foul from my side. I&#39;ll still be super grateful. All I want is to get off this rock, get to the next, better phase. </p>

<p>Thanks for asking and reading (if you did). </p>

<p>I&#39;m asking you <em>how that makes sense.</em> Why would anybody need to see innocent kids die in order to be satisfied? What kind of monster desires that?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes, because you escape from reality that way, into the illusion that you are a special being who is going to a blissful afterlife by doing those rituals. Of course that makes you feel better. Why wouldn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>Meanwhile toddlers are dying of leukemia. But a god exists who is doing you special favors on your ipod. Have you ever actually thought about how self-centered your thought process is?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jesus Christ is my conduit to the Divine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh, so you&#39;ve personally met him in person? Or do you only imagine interacting with him through your thoughts because that&#39;s what people have convinced you to do?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>There is no &quot;next&quot; phase. You are an animal and when you die you will disappear from existence just like mosquitos and zebras when they die. Live your life <em>now,</em> instead of waiting for a fantasy world that doesn&#39;t exist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do live my life now. I LOVE my life. My life is great--I have love, I&#39;m more &quot;awake&quot; than I&#39;ve been at any point in my awareness, I have a decent job that&#39;s not killing me or taking up too much of my time, I live in a nice town. </p>

<p>I&#39;m so sorry you have such a nihilistic view of the world. It&#39;s sad and wrong. </p>

<p>Appreciate your mostly civil engagement, but we don&#39;t really have much in common, and certainly nothing on this subject. </p>

<p>I hope you have an enlightenment of some sort. I&#39;ll pray for you tonight. Good luck!</p>
