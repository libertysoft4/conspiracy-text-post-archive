Let&#39;s not forget that Trump also has dirty secrets. This community has thrived on the fact that we report the truth one way or another, but must not allow them to label us what we are not. So lets start to look at Trump as well and seriously question his end as well. </p>

<p>EDIT: not even 5 minutes into the post and I am already getting down voted. Really? Am I in the wrong sub now?</p>

<p>EDIT: folks this is not pro Hillary post, this is a pro Truth post. We are looking for the truth not to pick candidates. I hate the fact that this has turned into a political movement for one specific candidate. Lets be fair in our approach. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the truth came out about trump and he raped a village full of school girls and then pissed on a camera man before lighting a Christmas tree on fire, then you could bet that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> might mention it. But the fact of the matter is most of the news that trump makes isn&#39;t conspiracy. Clinton is embroiled in a massive conspiracy! She and we people cover this page because the conspiracy is one of the largest that the world has ever known. Trump&#39;s shit makes the front of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> when it&#39;s also conspiratorial, such as when horribly damning videos of him from a decade ago only surface a few weeks before the general election and not during the primaries or at any other point in the past. Or why only now do women seem interested in accusing him of assualt by the droves? He&#39;s been rich for his whole life, if those women wanted money or justice they could&#39;ve screwed him years ago. So why now? What makes him running for president a more appealing target than him being an idiot playboy billionaire? It screams conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We all know. Around 80% of the sub knows. Trump shills/Hillary Shills are probably invading this sub. Both are pretty common actually. </p>

<p>The Trump Shills make Pro-Trump posts and downvote comments that are Anti-Trump, or most often downvoting those noting both candidates are evil (And that is excluding the comments that CTR (An infiltration organization commanded by Hillary) which deserves to be downvoted) while Hillary Shills make numerous Pro-Hillary comments and have no other activities other than in this sub. Albeit there is real proof that Hillary is going out of her way trying to infiltrate it.</p>

<p>In reality both sides are two faces of a coin.</p>

<p>However, i assume that there is still a pretty good deal of people who knows either candidate is evil and nobody on the political ring is a saint.</p>

<p>Yet another redditor assuming that I am on a side. I am on non one side. I am on the side of Truth, and if we look at truth in all angles this sub would be balanced in post. Like another redditor told me, the fact that Hillary represent what is wrong with the system and it is being reflected here is the reason why Hillary over takes the narrative. I understood what he means and I agree with him on that too. I saw his angle and I agree with it. But what you are assuming is your opinion in which, is wrong, but it is still your opinion.</p>

<p>yeah maybe I did, but you know what, It got a conversation going. And after a few rounds of post. I realized that the narrative is just moving with the tides and not really bias as I though it was. I started the conversation because I did not want us to be label anti-Hillary.

<p>Has zero bearing on her being a woman, I couldn&#39;t care less about the person&#39;s race, sex, sexual orientation. Their job is to aid the American people which not a single president in the past 40 years has done. So basically, I&#39;m anti-establishment.</p>
