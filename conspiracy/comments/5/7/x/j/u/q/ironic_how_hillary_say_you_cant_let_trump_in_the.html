    <div class="md"><p>Ironic how 2 families are passing the highest offices and appointments back and forth between their own wives, sons, and family friends/donors, and the only &quot;opposition&quot; candidates are somehow related to those families.</p>

<p>Trump is a clinton donor/family friend and Bill&#39;s golfing buddy, surprise surprise he was set up to completely take over her opposition and &quot;run against&quot; a Clinton. Kind of like how Bush II was set up to &quot;run against&quot; his own frat brother and fellow Bonesman, Al Gore.</p>

<p>the scariest part is how involved people become in their belief that this is an actual political contest between actual opposition candidates. It&#39;s like Putin setting up an election to run his wife against his donor/buddy,  just seems so obvious that it&#39;s BS, but somehow people don&#39;t realize it because no one on television has ever pointed it out for them. You&#39;d think maybe people would go &quot;hmm, that&#39;s a little fishy&quot; - instead they go &quot;go clinton II!&quot; or &quot;go trump!! omg!!&quot;. It&#39;s like watching people cheering for their favorite football team.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s obvious now that Trump has gone rogue and this theory holds not much merit any longer.  There&#39;s no way anyone controlled would say the things he&#39;s saying, have the entire establishment media attacking him nonstop, and both political parties lined up against him, while funding his own campaign.  We should all be supporting Trump for the countries sake.  You are helping Hillary win by constantly saying these unfounded claims about Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unless!... he&#39;s been set up/paid to say those things by the Clintons (reference to &quot;Bill&#39;s golfing buddy&quot;) to make HRC look like the better candidate and slingshot her into the White House. He has proven that he will do anything for money - so making himself look like a total ass to help Hillary win doesn&#39;t seem too ridiculous to me. And oh boy do the Clintons have the money to send his way. No way to confirm or deny any of this, but &quot;supporting Trump for the countries sake&quot; is not only supporting bigotry and violence - but will lead to an outcome as potentially awful as if the Clinton/Bush&#39;s continue to run our country.<br/>
We need a complete overhaul and political revolution to end the shitstorm we&#39;ve been living in for decades now. Or else complete anarchy to open everyone&#39;s eyes to the truth behind our corrupt and devastating system. 
And remember - every empire&#39;s days are numbered. It&#39;s only a matter of time before the US empire falls with the rest of them. I just hope it&#39;s before we all go extinct from climate change or nuclear war. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok... let me explain something. There is no place in the world where privilege doesn&#39;t exist for one cast or another. </p>

<p>So you feel that you are slightly more privileged in the area you reside due to existing social structures. This is why people are calling you brainwashed. Pick an &quot;unprivileged&quot; minority class and visit a country in which they are the majority and then tell me about your privilege. </p>

<p>The fact is you can&#39;t abolish privilege. Privilege exists on so many levels for as many different reasons. Language, looks, money, talent, etc, etc, etc.... how could anyone hope to wage a war on human nature on such a grand scale?</p>

<p>Oh right.. they won&#39;t but they will convince you to wage a war upon yourself by making you feel guilty for the crimes of THEIR ancestors.</p>

If we had someone who acknowledged this and took steps to combat it we would have a better future, in America and in the entire world.

We can make things better for everyone. We can level the playing ground. But to white people who have always been on the upper ground, when you LOWER their side to RAISE the other side, they see it as oppression. Which it isnt. We need a movement towards acceptance and tolerance and love and true equality. Trump stands for the opposite of all of these things.

Eventually everyone can attain a common ground but it&#39;s going to take everyone communicating in a more honest way instead of regurgitating the msm sensationalism of the week or dismantling progressive conversations with cries of bigotry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you live in a diverse community? I do. Do you know who gains access to social programs despite being able bodied? Do you see who&#39;s applications are denied and who&#39;s are approved with no regard as to whether they are able bodied or not? Being born poor and white and male will gain you the wonderful priveleges of zero social services unless you have undeniable evidence of need ( like a visible handicap ), zero college grants ( unless you have red hair and freckles (yes there is actually a grant for that) or some other trait that someone self identified with and left money to), zero tax exemptions that minorities and women are born with. The list goes on. </p>

<p>Are you aware that the US govt grants $$, $$$ as an incentive to foreigners to move here and establish a business? Apu is a stereotype for a reason. This is why, and if you wonder why the corner stores owner is different every 10 or so years it&#39;s due to a loophole being exploited in which the owner moves back home after &quot;selling&quot; the business to their family member who gets another grant and so on...</p>

<p>Private prisons lobby for laws that entrap the poor. Period. If you haven&#39;t been behind bars you wouldn&#39;t know what your talking about. Prisons don&#39;t care what color you are, they just want to maximize profits by having a full prison.</p>

<p>Please expound on your belief that the current legislation hinders the upward advancement of minorities while providing privilege to whites. </p>

<p>Edit: when you state that being white makes you more inclined to receive financial support, what form of support are you referring to? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that privilege exists but it&#39;s not inherently attached to being white. Being an extremely good looking anything gains you more privilege than being an average or ugly lower class white. How do you intend to address that? How do you intend to address the privilege that comes with being raised speaking english? Should we give preference to non-English speaking people when hiring because people raised speaking English are too privileged? Attempting to address privilege on any level other than economic is just chasing your tail. That&#39;s why the msm is redirecting by pointing at this privilege instead of the privilege of the 1% that had everyone&#39;s attention for awhile.

    <div class="md"><p>Ya. I get hands on guns sometimes still. I&#39;ve been messed with by cops as often as passed over. Where I live the cops that patrol are mostly minorities though and we have nicknames for the handful of white cops that come by cause everyone knows them personally since they stand out. Not sure how that reality fits into your views but there it is. When the minorities police themselves it&#39;s hard to claim that the number of minorities getting locked up or killed by police stems from oppression. There are problems with the system that involve police training and so on and they are usually willing to discuss those issues from an insiders perspective if you take the time to talk to an officer, but there are cultural issues within the lower class that need to be addressed as well. Laying onesided blame  without addressing the real issues makes things worse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I don&#39;t feel like he is painting any particular group to be subhuman like Hitler did with the Jews. I think the media and his political opponents have blown his comments and rhetoric way out of proportion. It&#39;s an absolute certainty that he is being targeted for vilification by the press. Hating Trump is easy and has become fashionable in certain circles. The fact if the matter is that both candidates are atrocious and I, along with many others, are genuinely worried about the state of our country. As far as the riots, I think there will be riots no matter who wins. A lot of people, especially Trump and Bernie supporters, feel like this election is a sham. It seems like some very important, wealthy, and powerful people want HRC to win, and that is a huge red flag in my opinion. We are in for a shitstorm and it&#39;s only just beginning.</p>

<p>That was in reference to the Democratic primary, not the general election. I did fail to mention that in the comment above and I can see how that may lead to misunderstanding.</p>

<p>The evidence of collusion in many different areas of the Democratic party to aid the Clinton campaign gain the nomination seems to indicate that she is not their most popular figure, though.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s impossible to prove statements about the world, so that&#39;s true (I&#39;m a mathematician, have to be precise here). That&#39;s what makes Occam&#39;s Razor useful. </p>

<p>In the actual world, you always have a set of observations and are trying to guess at the explanation. Occam&#39;s Razor tells you which explanation is the most useful at any given time. It&#39;s definitely useful to speculate beyond the bounds of Occam&#39;s Razor, otherwise we&#39;d never discover anything new. </p>

<p>The problem here is that people frequently seem to choose arbitrary explanations for facts which are mutually exclusive with simpler explanations, which fly way over the head of Occam&#39;s Razor (usually based on scarce information, and often clear misinterpretations of that scarce information). Then, instead of considering them more deeply to see if they may actually be true, they&#39;re often presented immediately as the most likely explanation for those facts. When you combine that with confirmation bias, things get ridiculous pretty often.</p>

<p>If any party involved has an interest in the U.S. election, then it&#39;s clearly damned easy for them to have planted or doctored one or two e-mails in these thousands.</p>

<p>Presumably, a conspiracy community should pride itself on careful thought and digging past the surface. So far there seem to be many distasteful elements to these e-mails, with spare evidence of actual corruption (there are a few things that may indicate actual corruption and warrant more digging). The response in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> seems to be dominated heavily by misreading and groupthink, and implicit community trust [does that even make sense in a conspiracy community?] that the e-mail releases are 100% accurate (the Scalia thing was ridiculous, various other things have just been flatly misread).</p>

<p>We don&#39;t know that the e-mails are from a foreign source, that&#39;s true (I corrected above). The U.S. government makes that claim, and the direct source is foreign (Wikileaks is not a U.S. organization and Julian Assange is not American). But I don&#39;t think anyone outside the actual people who leaked the e-mails (and possibly government) know anything about the real source.</p>

<p>Lol. I love how clarifying the election is becoming. There are those like you who cling to your cognitive dissonance seeking any excuse to absolve the behavior of Clinton.

    <div class="md"><p>A theory lifted from /pol: </p>

<p>Assange is safe for now. USA gov knows that if they kill Assange then he&#39;ll activate the deadman switch and release the 900gb torrent of all wikileaks info.</p>

<p>Pamela Anderson planted a microcomputer in the embassy, and the internet connection was severed to allow the British government to modify the routing from the embassy. These are efforts to completely nullify the deadman switch when Assange is terminated. The microcomputer planted by Anderson is monitoring audio, specifically the hard drive of Assange&#39;s computer, and upon activation it will function as a miniature jamming device to prevent wireless transmissions of the deadman switch. The Embassy&#39;s internet is currently being routed directly through the British government&#39;s servers, and it&#39;s possible that any communication from Assange to another party will be fully intercepted by the British government, regardless of encryption or any security measures used. It will also negate any attempts by Assange to activate his deadman switch.</p>

<p>Assange has information pertaining to Russia, US, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Israel and the current siege of Mosul. The US wants to stage a false flag attack so it can hit Russia with the most severe sanctions possible, but the US is hesitant due to Assange being in the picture. But by removing Assange, the western governments risk having a metric ton of incriminating data released to the public.</p>

<p>It&#39;s frightening to think how this might all pan out in the future.</p>

<p>Assange needs to be notified to have a thorough sweeping of the area for any wireless devices.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the same people who used their political power to keep Hillary out of jail for the felonies she committed are the same people worried that Trump would use his political power to make sure she does get held accountable for those felonies. In conclusion, an opponent using political power to hold one of their own accountable for serious crimes is a &quot;dangerous&quot; abuse of power. However, using political power to make sure people on their team are above the law is perfectly reasonable and sensible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>These e-mails are unrelated to her private server (they&#39;re ostensibly from Podesta&#39;s gmail account, and so far they seem likely to be legit). There&#39;s no evidence so far that her private server was ever compromised that I&#39;m aware of, but who knows what will show up next.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t know that the e-mails are from a foreign source, that&#39;s true (I corrected above). The U.S. government makes that claim, and the direct source is foreign (Wikileaks is not a U.S. organization and Julian Assange is not American). But I don&#39;t think anyone outside the actual people who leaked the e-mails (and possibly government) know anything about the real source.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You realize of course that laws are put in place that benefit the caste system. (Caste not cast.) If we had someone who acknowledged this and took steps to combat it we would have a better future, in America and in the entire world. I&#39;m not content with sitting idly by and (what you do) just make shitty reddit comments saying &quot;oh that&#39;s just how things are, we can&#39;t change it&quot; that&#39;s BULLSHIT. we can change the world. We can make things better for everyone. We can level the playing ground. But to white people who have always been on the upper ground, when you LOWER their side to RAISE the other side, they see it as oppression. Which it isnt. We need a movement towards acceptance and tolerance and love and true equality. Trump stands for the opposite of all of these things. He stands for the people who want to keep things the way they are. Shit is fucked up and I refuse to allow nothing to change. </p>
