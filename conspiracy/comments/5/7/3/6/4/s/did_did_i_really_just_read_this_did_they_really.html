<p>Well, we all thought the big problem for our US democracy was Citizens United/Koch Brothers big money in politics. Silly us; turns out that money isn&#39;t all that important if you can conflate entertainment with the electoral process. Trump masters TV, TV so-called news picks up and repeats and repeats to death this opinionated blowhard and his hairbrained ideas, free-floating discontent attaches to a seeming strongman and we&#39;re off and running. JFK, Jr would be delighted by all this as his &quot;George&quot; magazine saw celebrity politics coming. The magazine struggled as it was ahead of its time but now looks prescient. George, of course, played the development pretty lightly, basically for charm and gossip, like People, but what we are dealing with now is dead serious. How does this get handled in the general? Secretary Clinton is not an entertainer, and not a celebrity in the Trump, Kardashian mold; what can she do to offset this? I&#39;m certain the poll-directed insiders are sure things will default to policy as soon as the conventions are over, but I think not.  And as I&#39;ve mentioned, we&#39;ve all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to <strong>produce an unaware and compliant citizenry.</strong> The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging.</p>

<p>While the first step is to have a clearly drafted and specific alternative to our defunct government (cant leave that to some random revolutionary authoritarian), we need to reach critical mass across institutions around the country to mobilize Americans to storm DC by the millioms until they re-instate the laws and constitution that were essentially suspended since the Patriot Act.</p>

<p>But massive withdrawal within the population of people that have 401k&#39;s will cause a major shock.  Because 401k&#39;s and mortgages are financial products that profit from inventing money from nothing.

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. I&#39;m basically paraphrasing Sharon Beder, but I keep running into those three aspects in my research into propaganda and mass manipulation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it must have three aspects. Firstly it needs to provide a rationale for minimising government intervention. Secondly it needs to justify “untrammelled, uninhibited pursuit and possession of wealth” in terms of the common good. Thirdly it needs to explain poverty and unemployment in terms of the individual faults of those who find themselves in that situation.[79] Economic education sought to provide all three.</p>

<p>Clearly ‘economic education’, in schools, workplaces and in broader public fora, plays a crucial role in achieving capitalist hegemony.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The 2016 primaries and election have truly been a site to behold if you approach cable news and the big media corps with a cynical eye. They have the process down on capitalizing on any damaging Trump news through pundits, while diminishing/downplaying massive government corruption stories that puts Watergate to shame on the other side.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll check those links out. I read Edward Bernays before this election and holy shit... they have perfected the craft (before the advent of social media I think, which has put them on the defensive about their blatant propaganda). </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. ...We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized. Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society. ...In almost every act of our daily lives, whether in the sphere of politics or business, in our social conduct or our ethical thinking, we are dominated by the relatively small number of persons...who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses. It is they who pull the wires which control the public mind.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>― Edward L. Bernays, Propaganda</p>

<p>There are also more insidious ways to control the masses, such as through economic insecurity, but every tyrant relies on fear of a &quot;common enemy&quot; to keep the population scared, compliant, and wanting more protection from daddy government.</p>

<p>This is crucial. United States in 2016 is reliving a lot of the culminating moments throughout history where the people go from complacency to revolution, but it hasn&#39;t happened yet because we still get food stamps (so people don&#39;t get hungry/angry enough), and because we are still fighting the inertia of so many Americans being unaware and compliant. Having awareness is good, but change won&#39;t happen gradually, as much as we will wake up one day in a police state full of surveillance, carefully-crafted propaganda instead of news, silencing of dissent, incarceration for those labelled as &quot;internal enemies&quot;, etc etc etc. Scary times in a way. I&#39;m starting to think the book &quot;The Fourth Turning&quot; is quite prophetic.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Indeed. The one warning I have about basic income, is that they are both pushing for a cashless society, and the idea of basic income (with strings attached I&#39;m sure... nothing in life will be free).</p>

<p>Side Bonus: If there is a massive financial crash before 2018 (baked in the cake IMO) and the IMF bails out the US as our true world saviors (instituting a basket of currencies through SDRs), it confirms that this has also all been a giant con by the global bankers.

    <div class="md"><p>You could implement basic income through existing  online bank account or an online wallet tied to natonal id eg- an implantable chip is unnecessary. It&#39;s essentially an export programme for basic necessity companies to regular people to  stimulate spending and provide them with security. This could easily be done by stopping compound interest and other parasitic schemes the zionist banking cartel have conjured up, bringing the money creation back to the government and people, reducing the cost of capital, helping businesses and industry, government and consumers by increasing profits, reducing business costs, consumer prices and taxation by curbing the parasitic banking sector. Most importantly it would be democratic, stopping the zionist from corrupting media government academia law and politics. Marx never told you this, but lincoln sure did</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s hard to come up with an alternative to what we have that would not be just as easily corruptible, but indeed compound interest and time-value of money concepts are quite dangerous for most that don&#39;t take the time to understand all of its ramifications (the bankers do, and they enslave one country after the other under their scheme... they bomb and topple the ones that don&#39;t play along).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My opinion is that technology innovation and efficiency improvement is the only way forward, a basic income would give people the security to further increase support for tech innovation, the majority of profits made by banks are not legitimate and only serve to provide them with a greater share of the money supply which they use corrupt the institutions of democracy and cause 911 nor dissimilar to whatever they were doing in pre nazi europe</p>

<p>I also think that the study of economics and monetary policy is intended to deceive and not elucidate nor to serve people. I agree rent seeking behavior should be discouraged especially as it applies to residential property and banking which should be reverted to its social function of connecting borrowers and savers and insurance and money creation returned to a democratic body. Innovation isn&#39;t going to come from some zionist banker fuck and his ilk, its going to come from people who are empowered to innovate</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that technology innovation will pave the way, in that the goal should be more transparency in markets, and a free-er flow of information (the elites make TRILLIONS often because they are the holders of most of the actionable <em>information</em> in the world, by design).</p>

<p>The balance in economics and human nature is to satisfy the basic needs of all humans, and balance short-term WANTS with long-term sustainability. One of the worst developments in today&#39;s world is the financialization of EVERYTHING in the economy, so that the goal is not to do what is best for ALL <em>stakeholders</em> of a company in the long-term, but to do everything possible to increase profits for <em>shareholders</em> by next quarter. It&#39;s a fucked up frat-boy &quot;I got a bigger dick than you&quot; mentality that is crushing the entire planet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah i agree, it is a parasitical sector filled with with evil people who do not know how to function in society given responsibility for people&#39;s pensions and mortgage and who have abused this responsibility entrusted by society to raid and terrorise the people time after time so they can get their hands on a greater share of the money supply which they use to war monger and send folks to die in a phony war and fund the archetypal parasite state aka israel.</p>

<p>I agree the short termism of publically listed companies and the trading of currency and indices  is a recipe for instability and corruption and is essentially a proxy for the vote of the parasitic war profiteers. It&#39;s no accident that innovat ion happens so successfully at universities and darpa.</p>

<p>Although not an ultimate truth (some edge cases are to be expected,) &quot;schooling&quot; is more concerned with petty information ( a large chunk of which is controversial and/or false,) rather than meta cognition, psychology, long term frameworks for learning etc.  This should be the reddest of red flags for all to ponder.</p>

<p>Absolutely. I think for parents it is a cheaper form of childcare at this point, for kids is a mechanical bullshit stepping stone they tell you you have to go through to chase after the American dream, but the idea is not to develop humans that can think for and rely on themselves (which is I believe the ULTIMATE bliss, instead of &quot;blissful&quot; ignorance).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said.</p>

<p>In the past, I&#39;ve used &quot;Ignorance is Bliss&quot; in conversation and sometimes thought it to even be true in some circumstances.  I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if this was injected into the minds of children when they are young.  Now, I am completely in line with your views, especially after understanding (some of) the scope of the lies in modern society.  I can only imagine how deep it really goes.</p>

<p>Actually, come to think of it, I think I first learned of &quot;Ignorance Is Bliss&quot; through the propaganda novel &quot;The Giver&quot; which was mandatory reading in one of my middle school classes (or high school?  I forget.)  What do you know!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait, #1 is entirely valid. We are in the mess we are in today because of a government that is too big Wi-Fi had too much power. They have sold that power to the corporations (in the form of tax preferences, criminal prosecution immunity, absence of regulation, or just cash). </p>

<p>Currently the federal government can regulate just about anything. This was not the case 100 years ago. But today, the federal government will give corporations/banks (and the responsible individuals on their board of directors) immunity from criminal prosecution, selectively enforce regulation, not to mention bail them out for trillions of dollars using our tax dollars. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t expect you to believe me but regulation is a bad thing, government has their hands in just about every single pot, they&#39;re causing every single crisis with their ridiculous planned economy, we are literally trillions in debt to a group of private bankers who own our entire economy. And you think this is because of a lack of regulations? They regulate everything in their own favor, that&#39;s how it works. Every dollar that is born into existence represents DEBT to the federal reserve, and that is because we  have a central bank in this country that prints debt notes. Go read The Creature of Jekyll Island to learn about these so called regulations you want so badly.</p>

<p>The regulation, of course, is two centuries-worth of production, in the matter of 2 decades entirely uprooted itself and went to China. You think that&#39;s because we need more regulations? No, it&#39;s because our country is so over-regulated in the favor of these banker fucks that to earn a damn dime you have to move to China to even come up with a profit! Of course, the regulations aren&#39;t to help anyone -- they&#39;re there so bankers can dip their fingers and get a taste of the profit. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>There is no evidence to support the claim that the centralization of national academic standards raises student achievement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And there is no evidence that DECENTRALIZED education systems are better, either. This is disingenuous at best, dishonest at worst.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The adoption process was flawed. State legislators were not involved in the process and “we the people” were not given a voice. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is subjective. It was adopted the same way most education initiatives are, and it is still a choice. Any state can opt out at any time. So you still have  a&quot;voice.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s unconstitutional. There is no legitimate role established for the federal government in setting state education policy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is also subjective. The argument is that, because the constitution does not SPECIFICALLY state that the US Gov&#39;t can use grant programs as incentive, this is unconstitutional. I don&#39;t buy that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The standards are not of high quality. The Common Core standards were not ranked as the top set of standards within the United States by the <strong>Fordham Institute.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh wow, a conservative think-tank doesn&#39;t think the standards are that good. Sounds like a fair and balanced source /s</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Common Core standards are “instruction-based standards” that limit how content will be taught to students. Teachers will be forced to use instructional strategies that are experimental and have not been proven to raise student achievement, and that in many cases have even proven to be failures. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is just untrue. I read the entire compendium report from CEP, and their official conclusion is &quot;no clear trends have yet emerged. more data required.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Common Core standards diminish the amount of literature read in English class in favor of informational texts. Data from international tests, such as PISA, show a strong correlation between higher literacy scores and students who read more complex literature. The same cannot be said about informational texts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, cherry picking a study that shows a correlation between high test scores and reading literature. This is to imply that reading informational texts will decrease test scores, but that isn&#39;t true.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The federal government is collecting massive amounts of personally identifiable information on students. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The standards are costly. National implementation of the Common Core standards and assessments will cost an estimated $15 billion across the participating states, according to the Pioneer Institute.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the only good point so far. Yes, it is very costly, and since it&#39;s technically unproven, and new, I see why this concerns many people.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>States with the earliest implementation of the Common Core standards, such as Kentucky, have seen a decline in student achievement on the National Assessment of Education Progress, showing a lack of results from the standards.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More cherry picking. Read the CEP reports.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The new Common Core pilot tests were plagued with major technical difficulties and complaints from teachers regarding the content. Parents are upset that the Common Core increases the amount of time spent on testing and robs the classroom of valuable instruction time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a valid complaint, as well, I think.</p>

<p>Well, thanks for the info, man.</p>

<p>And there is no evidence that DECENTRALIZED education systems are better, either. This is disingenuous at best, dishonest at worst.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem there lies in funding of schools, priority we give to teachers and education in this country, etc. etc. We are fucked, but it is not because of decentralization IMO.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is subjective. It was adopted the same way most education initiatives are, and it is still a choice. Any state can opt out at any time. So you still have a&quot;voice.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They turned a &quot;choice&quot; into a bribe to states, tying grant money to the adoption of common core behind everyone&#39;s backs.</p>

<p>There is a lot to discuss on common core but unfortunately I don&#39;t have the time. If I have the choice for my kids to learn like humans have learned about life for thousands of years, I will go with much better existing models of education.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Common core is only about setting standards, there are no educational materials  no curriculum materials.</p>

<p>One reason it was created was so that a child moving from Alabama in 4th grade to New Hampshire would be at the same level as  his or her new classmates.  </p>

<p>One reason the Bush Adm, pushed the standards was that long hard sell to &quot;make teachers and schools accountable.&quot;  </p>

<p>1) Common Core math</p>

<p>2) Gym is like a military drill. Everybody waits in their locker rooms after getting changed (door is locked until the teacher comes out with them). After, you do 5 minutes of each type of workout- sit ups, pushups, jumpingjacks, lunges, for half an hour. They do this EVERY. DAY. No playing basketball or walking the track, no, you workout and then EVERYBODY does the same sport until the end of class, and it isn&#39;t PLAYING, it&#39;s &quot;practicing.&quot; Stand there and dribble the basketball. Okay. Now go bounce it against the wall like you are passing it. Okay here is a basebal, toss it up and catch it.</p>

<p>3) They had bagged grilled cheese sandwiches at lunch. The vending machines were removed because &quot;they were unhealthy&quot; but never replaced with something healthy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The second paragraph was pointing out the maturity of the author. 20 years in journalism and &quot;bimbo eruptions&quot; is what he chooses to put in his short bio.  That says to me professionalism and integrity are not his strong points. </p>

<p>You do not have to agree with my example. Calling them alarmist websites instead of alternative news site creates a bias against something that does not go along with their version of the narrative. As for the rest of the artilce i have not dug that deep yet. Just a quick scan came up with a form of bias which is what you asked for. My bad if I was able to present that with a quick scan of the article and not a full read.</p>

<p>&quot;Hi, CTR here</p>

<p>Apparently you guys are as dumb as <a href="/r/the_pussygrabber">/r/the_pussygrabber</a> if you actually believe that CTR is spamming reddit</p>

<p>But hey, CTR pays me 1 bitcoin for each pro-hillary post so I guess I just admitted to everything&quot;</p>

<p>Tells me you cannot admit the criminal you support does anything wrong or you get fired. Funny though how there is so much evidence of ctr manipulation on reddit and your master will force you to deny it to then end. Overwhelming evidence..yet you still try to deny it...but hey if it works for shitlary why would it not work for her online truth suppression team. </p>

<p>I will admit it is an alternative news site.Some article come across as sensational so does all your ctr approved new sources. I gave you an example of bias, you choose not to accept it. That is ok, i would fear shitlaries retribution if I was you too. Cannot end up like Seth Rich can you. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Individuals who commented about Adams&#39; website include astronomer and blogger Phil Plait, PZ Myers, and Mark Hoofnagle. Brian Dunning listed it as #1 on his &quot;Top 10 Worst Anti-Science Websites&quot; list. Adams is listed as a &quot;promoter of questionable methods&quot; by Quackwatch. Robert T. Carroll at The Skeptic&#39;s Dictionary said, &quot;Natural News is not a very good source for information. If you don&#39;t trust me on this, go to Respectful Insolence or any of the other bloggers on ScienceBlogs and do a search for &quot;Natural News&quot; or &quot;Mike Adams&quot; (who is Natural News).

<p>I read <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> because it&#39;s bad to surround yourself with an ideological echo chamber.  So I&#39;m here both to expose myself to conspiratorial viewpoints and to expose others in the conspiracy theory echo chamber to non-conspiratorial viewpoints.  </p>

I do not support either candidate but I for some reason feel it is my job to help others see what a waste of life shitlary is.

<p>Fair enough.</p>

<p>If you bother to look up the posting history of a redditor of 6 years who mostly comments about video games, and still reflexively call them a ctr shill for disagreeing with you, the accusation kind of loses its punch. Hint: The main sign of an astroturfer is posting in volume and with repetition of phrases.  Even then, it&#39;s also the sign of an ideological zealot so it&#39;s hard to tell.  My comment wasn&#39;t so much about education (high school education isn&#39;t elitist) as the TL;DR syndrome that afflicts a large number of redditors.  It&#39;s a safe assumption that the majority of people upvoting and commenting here have only read the snippet in the OP.</p>

<p>He specifically says they conspire to PRODUCE an unaware and compliant citizenry. Not that they take advantage of it. Sounds like they are actively promoting this lack of awareness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People should also read the whole paragraph.  Look at this shit:</p>

<p>&quot;Dear John:    Well, we all thought the big problem for our US democracy was Citizens United/Koch Brothers big money in politics. Silly us; turns out that money isn&#39;t all that important if you can conflate entertainment with the electoral process. Trump masters TV, TV so-called news picks up and repeats and repeats to death this opinionated blowhard and his hairbrained ideas, free-floating discontent attaches to a seeming strongman and we&#39;re off and running. JFK, Jr would be delighted by all this as his &quot;George&quot; magazine saw celebrity politics coming. The magazine struggled as it was ahead of its time but now looks prescient. George, of course, played the development pretty lightly, basically for charm and gossip, like People, but what we are dealing with now is dead serious. How does this get handled in the general? Secretary Clinton is not an entertainer, and not a celebrity in the Trump, Kardashian mold; what can she do to offset this? I&#39;m certain the poll-directed insiders are sure things will default to policy as soon as the conventions are over, but I think not. <em>And as I&#39;ve mentioned, we&#39;ve all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging.</em></p>

<p>Absolutely. Ask anyone who considers themselves &quot;aware&quot; of all the amoral shenanigans from those in power, and the process of investigating all that is out there gets exhausting and ultimately depressing (as in actual depression and a sense of helplessness/lack of control). More and more, what we see is outright disdain for us common folk who dare to hope that our government is there to serve us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is that the mindless followers are pretty common on both sides. A lot of Clinton followers have no critical thinking skills, but the same can be said for a lot of trumps. The average voter is remarkably uninformed and has a hard time thinking for themselves. Which of course makes them easy prey for people like Clinton or Trump who use them to reach their own goals. </p>

<p>Trump does have some good things to say, but so does Clinton. And pretending like one is an ultimate evil while the other is  blameless messiah here to save the country is ridiculous. We need more balance and discussion. More policy driven debates and less of the shenanigans we are seeing now. </p>

<p>That&#39;s the problem here. The masses have found that being entertained is more interesting than being informed. So now they dance like puppets on a string while thinking they are smarter than their perceived rivals. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Private capital tends to become concentrated in few hands, partly because of competition among the capitalists, and partly because technological development and the increasing division of labor encourage the formation of larger units of production at the expense of the smaller ones.</p>

<p>The result of these developments is an oligarchy of private capital the enormous power of which cannot be effectively checked even by a democratically organised political society.</p>

<p>This is true since the members of legislative bodies are selected by political parties, largely financed or otherwise influenced by private capitalists who, for all practical purposes, separate the electorate from the legislature. The consequence is that the representatives of the people do not in fact sufficiently protect the interests of the underprivileged sections of the population.</p>

<p><strong>Moreover, under existing conditions, private capitalists inevitably control, directly or indirectly, the main sources of information (press, radio, education).</strong> It is thus extremely difficult, and indeed in most cases quite impossible, for the individual citizen to come to objective conclusions and to make intelligent use of his political rights. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly i really believed this document topped them all, i really thought there&#39;s no way in hell they can explain this. While your try was good it was not accurate enough, you just commented on the first part but the part that has the biggest meaning is this:</p>

<p>&quot; And as I&#39;ve mentioned, we&#39;ve all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging.&quot;</p>

<p>This is the part that you need to explain, it sure needs a really creative answer because in my eyes there&#39;s no other way ti see it. </p>

<p>Before this one i thought the one saying she needs to block foreign governments from sending medical help to war victims so she can send first to win points was inexcusable, but people did try very hard to explain it, which again i find inconceivable, so lets see what will happen with this one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean come on now, you&#39;re really acting like a layer now that needs to save his guilty client. First, you dont go back and ask for an answer and use that answer to justify the so obvious statement he did when he was unaware that this would get public. </p>

<p>Look, this line is pretty self explanatory, this is what their intentions were, in plain english.</p>

<p>&quot;we&#39;ve all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry.&quot;</p>

<p>This is a justification of the pure intention, he literally  says that they are still unaware and that is still going well but the compliance is fading, meaning they are still blind and stupid but they get distracted and don&#39;t listen: </p>

<p>&quot;The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven,....&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yea, you better get you butt clean cuz they&#39;ll give it to us really hard. I see the same thing and i just wonder if we can really pull this off and not elect Hillary as president. The issue is that many people are very ignorant, they just can&#39;t see it. What is so obvious to us is conspiracy to them and they see us the same way, but in our case we just see the facts, true leaked facts and what is going on with all this censorship etc, they don&#39;t realize this because they think we are Trump supporters and all that go with that, which was pretty well structured by the media not to look good. This is not true though, when you start chatting with people you will soon realize the most people who will vote for Trump are people who realize the importance to keep Hillary out and just hope for a change, one that might bring back the power to the people. But i do think they might have it, i just cant tell anymore how many of us are really out there. I see online polls and Trump is destroying Hillary, i see media polls and Hillary wins. I try to compare based on people posting but then you have all this censoring that again you can&#39;t really know. The media forget about it, we all know what is going on there, so i just dont know. I want to hope that especially younger generations that live in the internet and usually are unbiased to political parties are on our side, but then i see some really brainwashed young people that not only support Hillary but you can consider them fanatics. Also, i&#39;m kinda split on Bernie supporters, Bernies people are usually good, i want peace and freedom kind of people, that i hope can realize the importance on not voting Hillary, but from what i see in the media they&#39;re saying Hillary has those votes, all my Bernie friends though would rather cut their hands off, so again, good luck figuring this out. I guess at this point is trying to spread out the leaks and hope they will reach the open minded people because they will definitely not hear anything in the media, then i guess November will show. I do believe though that those leaks are the final act of international governments to wake us up so we can prevent war. If you see the YouTube videos, foreign leaders called us out and they&#39;re done putting up with us, Putting especially pointed out Hillarie&#39;s corruption and manipulation and said he will not put up with it. China and Europeans(citizens not the gov) are done with us too. They are right, we are manipulating and killing their people while out people are sleeping and have no clue of what is really going on, the sad those same people are ready be manipulated into picking up arms and fighting for our corruption and elite greed. So whatever is going to happen will happen guys, i just know that if Hillary starts a war i will not sacrifice my life. What our founding fathers predicted many many years ago is happening now, our government operates completely opposite of what they structured it and its &quot;us&quot; the peoples fault for letting it happen. I guess now history will repeat and we will pay the price of our ignorance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I&#39;ve said before, you don&#39;t know how much of it is real.</p>

<p>In my observation, the single main thing that the American government wants at the moment, is to get the public sufficiently angry that they will attempt to rise up, so that the government will then have pretext to engage in a truly massive crackdown, and throw any pretense of a free society completely out the window.  Hence, they could well be using the Podesta emails in order to try and make themselves look like even more complete raving psychopaths than they actually are, so that you will get so angry that you will become violent.</p>

<p>Everything they will do from here on in will be an attempt to trigger you, so that they then have an excuse to subjugate and abuse you.  Don&#39;t give them one.</p>

When you look at the social sciences of that era, a lot of work focused on this kind of thing: figuring out how to manipulate people through various means and for various purposes. Gustave le Bon, Freud, etc. Add to this the work of 1900s propagandists like Bernays, which it looks like others here already have covered, and one can see where I&#39;m going with this line of thinking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re both in on it.</p>

<p>Trump &amp; Clinton are both backed by billionaires like Koch &amp; Soros. Clinton is crazy backed by Time Warner who owns HBO &amp; CNN which explains why CNN is tits out for Hillary.</p>

<p>FOX backs Trump. FOX is owned by Murdoch&#39;s Newscorp which has faced a ton of criticism for journalism breech of ethics.</p>

<p>You think Murdoch gives a fuck if the gays can get married?</p>

<p>He&#39;s just happy to be making money by pandering to conservatives while profiting off liberals.</p>

<p>All the major media outlets work together. When Ron Paul was running, it was obvious they colluded to ruin his campaign. Same goes with Bernie Sanders. The system is rigged to put in a CFR puppet and they&#39;ve pretty much promised it to Clinton.</p>

<p>From the context, it appears to be a sarcastic commentary on the current state of public discourse in this country. Which, given the ridiculous shit people are saying both in the news and online the past few years, seems spot on.</p>

<p>You also left off the final sentence which drives home the tone of the whole email.</p>

<p>&quot;I fear we are all now trying to navigate a set of forces that cannot be simply explained or fully understood, so it is and will reamin[sic] interesting!&quot;</p>

<p>Ya&#39;ll seriously need to read it again. This time focus less on the words and more on the message. This isn&#39;t a grand conspiracy, it isn&#39;t even a story. There are MUCH more important things to be worried about.</p>
