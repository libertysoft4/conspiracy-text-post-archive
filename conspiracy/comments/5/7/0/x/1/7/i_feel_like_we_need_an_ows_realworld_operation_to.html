    <div class="md"><p><strong>My own annotated list of findings:</strong></p>

<p><sup>I was around for 10/10 - 10/11, did not research 10/7 -- there&#39;s a lot more, feel free to add</sup></p>

<p><strong>Progressive Targets</strong></p>

<p>Gabbard threatened with a pullout of campaign funding for resigning her position to endorse Sanders in February. <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3609">1</a></p>

<p>Attempt to pressure MoveOn to keep Warren out of the campaign six months before Hillary declared candidacy <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4313">1</a> </p>

<p>On Elizabeth Warren and her staff: &quot;Over all, it was a polite and engaged but not exactly warm conversation. They seem wary - and pretty convinced that the (Robert) Rubin (of Goldman Sachs) folks have the inside track with us whether we realize it yet or not&quot; <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4647">1</a></p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Union Shadiness</strong></p>

<p>Labor unions contacting campaign prior to formal announcement. <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4551">1</a></p>

<p>IAM union leadership endorsing in back channels outside their usual convention. <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/5107">1</a></p>

<p>AFT union leader suggesting reprisals on National Nurses United for their endorsement of Sanders. <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/2482">1</a></p>

<p>Unions contributing to the Hillary Victory Fund PAC, rather than the campaign. <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4014">1</a></p>

<p>Union leadership sandbagging their membership from endorsing Sanders. <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/2713">1</a></p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Media Shadiness</strong></p>

<p>Congratulatory letter to Haim Saban for the debate moderators at the Univision debate. (Saban has a controlling interest in Univision, and is a major Clinton donor/supporter.) <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3782">1</a></p>

<p>Putting together a prepared statement in an &quot;interview&quot; in order to defuse the emails situation. <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4926">1</a></p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>FEC Issues</strong></p>

<p>Ready for Hillary PAC discussing contributions in Jan 2015, five months before the candidacy, so as to skirt FEC reporting requirements. <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3342">1</a></p>

<p>Priorities USA and Bridge PAC colluding with campaign six months before formal annoucement of candidacy. <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4934">1</a></p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Policy Dishonesty</strong></p>

<p>On TPP: &quot;I accept the positon we’re taking but she has generally been more pro-trade than anti and we get we need politically by opposing this&quot; <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/5192">1</a></p>

<p>Clinton wanted to embrace a revised Glass-Steagall in the primaries, but decided it was more convenient to criticize her opponent rather than flip-flop. <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3778">1</a></p>

<p>Drafting a letter to dodge Nader on raising the minimum wage. <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4500">1</a></p>

<p>Clinton statements on economic &quot;opportunity&quot; so vague that they are interchangeable with Jeb Bush. <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/848">1</a></p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Possible Leads (Need Follow-Up)</strong></p>

<p>Bill Clinton&#39;s letter of resignation from Teneo (JC is Justin Cooper, what were the edits, are these of interest?) <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4632">1</a></p>

<p>Specific meeting of policy hits against Sanders, also shows coordination between CTR, DNC, and campaign though only on GOP, so on the surface not very substantial. (Possible a follow-up with attachment in later release, would be from <a href="mailto:tcarrk@hillaryclinton.com">tcarrk@hillaryclinton.com</a> ???) <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/5267">1</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry I meant to mention I had followed the Cooper page and didn&#39;t see any edits, don&#39;t think they ever got made.</p>

<p>I decided to try and review a few other Teneo principals and found this:</p>

<p><strong>Douglas Band</strong></p>

(11/30/11)</p>

<p>Items removed in <em>italics</em></p>

<p>The Honorable Douglas J. Band currently serves as Counselor to President William J. Clinton and is a Founding Partner and Co-Chief Executive Officer of Teneo.</p>

<p>Mr. Band began his career working in the White House in 1995 and has been with President Clinton for 16 years. He has served as President Clinton&#39;s chief advisor since 2002, counseling him, serving as the key architect of Mr. Clinton&#39;s post-Presidency, <em>and overseeing the 1,400 employees and volunteers of the William J. Clinton Foundation. He continues to serve as President Clinton&#39;s most senior advisor.</em></p>

<p>Prior to his role as Counselor to President Clinton, Mr. Band served in the White House Counsel&#39;s office for four years, becoming a Special Assistant to the President before he was made one of the youngest Deputy Assistants ever to serve a President of the United States.</p>

<p>Mr. Band is a graduate of the University of Florida and while working at the White House for 6 years, he simultaneously obtained a masters degree from Georgetown University in Liberal Arts and a Law degree from Georgetown University Law School by attending both programs in the evenings.</p>

<p>As Counselor to President Clinton, Mr. Band has traveled to nearly 100 countries and over 2,000 cities. He created and built the Clinton Global Initiative that to date has raised over $63 billion for nearly 2,000 philanthropic initiatives around the world which in total has impacted over 300 million people in 180 countries.</p>

<p><em>Mr. Band continues to serve his country in assisting various domestic agencies and advising foreign governments on nation building, infrastructure creation and democratic governance structure. He serves as President Clinton&#39;s representative to the White House and other governments, organizations and businesses around the world. Additionally, Mr. Band has advised several heads of state on their transitions out of office. He orchestrated the release of two American journalists captured in North Korea in the summer of 2009 and has assisted in the rebuilding of nations and regions after some of the worst natural disasters in the past decade including southeast Asia, Haiti, New Orleans and Gujarat, India. He serves on the Coca-Cola Company International Advisory Board, on the Advisory Board of Avenue Capital and as a member of the faculty of New York University as an adjunct professor.</em></p>

<p>(He also upped his &quot;philanthropic initiative&quot; stats on the newer release but this is less important than the omissions.)</p>

<hr/>

<p>I also tried comparing <strong>Declan Kelly</strong> since I knew he had a working relationship with the Clintons but didn&#39;t find anything interesting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In fact, I checked all of the bios that ref Clinton in that timeframe (Vaisman, Shea, Porter, Lefebvre, Dworin) and Band&#39;s is the only one with omissions. It&#39;s also worth noting that WJC&#39;s bio as Chairman is removed within the same timeframe.</p>
