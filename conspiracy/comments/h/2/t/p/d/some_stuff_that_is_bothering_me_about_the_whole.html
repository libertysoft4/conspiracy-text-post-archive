        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have to get this off my chest. I just want to point out a few discrepancies that are just really really bothering me:</p>

<p>1) Map of distance from Islamabad (35 miles south of the compound where he was found) to the North Arabian sea where he was supposedly buried at sea using <a href="http://www.distancefromto.net/">http://www.distancefromto.net/</a> , which unfortunately will not let me post a map to my knowledge, but tells me that from Islamabad to the Northern Arabian sea is roughly 
900 miles. </p>

<p>2) I want to establish that the media is reporting two different helicopter types were used: the Chinook and the Sikorsky MH-60 Blackhawk helicopters (personally I believe the latter as they&#39;re more for extraction and less for transporting large crews like the Chinook)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/05/the-secret-team-that-killed-osama-bin-laden/238163/">http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/05/the-secret-team-that-killed-osama-bin-laden/238163/</a></p>

<p>first sentence : &quot;From Ghazi Air Base in Pakistan, the modified MH-60 helicopters made their way to the garrison suburb of Abbottabad, about 30 miles from the center of Islamabad. Aboard were Navy SEALs,&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_CH-47_Chinook#Iraq_and_Afghanistan">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_CH-47_Chinook#Iraq_and_Afghanistan</a></p>

<p>&quot;On 1 May 2011, Chinook helicopters were used for carrying around two dozen US Navy SEALS into the compound where Osama bin Laden was staying. The overnight raid ended in the killing of Osama bin Laden&quot;</p>

<p>and now we establish the sources of chinook reporting:
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=SEALS+chinook&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;client=firefox-a#sclient=psy&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=Z3P&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US%3Aofficial&amp;source=hp&amp;q=SEALS+chinook+osama&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&amp;fp=c9365e657b732f11&amp;biw=1367&amp;bih=685">http://www.google.com/search?q=SEALS+chinook&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;client=firefox-a#sclient=psy&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=Z3P&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US%3Aofficial&amp;source=hp&amp;q=SEALS+chinook+osama&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&amp;fp=c9365e657b732f11&amp;biw=1367&amp;bih=685</a></p>

<p>you can see that for yourself.</p>

<p>3) now we establish the cost and specs of each:
mh-60 Blackhawk
Cost :14 million as you can see from the little box on the right there <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikorsky_UH-60_Black_Hawk">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikorsky_UH-60_Black_Hawk</a></p>

<p>Speed: 222 mph top speed in good conditions <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikorsky_UH-60_Black_Hawk#Specifications_.28UH-60L.29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikorsky_UH-60_Black_Hawk#Specifications_.28UH-60L.29</a></p>

<p>Chinook
cost: average of $35 million <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_CH-47_Chinook">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_CH-47_Chinook</a></p>

<p>top speed: 196 mph top speed in good conditions: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_CH7_Chinook#Specifications_.28CH-47D.29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_CH7_Chinook#Specifications_.28CH-47D.29</a></p>

<p>So what we have here is a 900 (roughly) mile trip from Islamabad to the ocean to drop the body is completed in roughly 4 hours 6 minutes by the Blackhawk or 4.6 hours by the Chinook. Either way, you mean to tell me that the body was positively ID&#39;d in the 4 hours it was in flight? </p>

<p>4) The reason I brought up the cost of the helicopter is to point out that the SEALS either detonated and destroyed a $35 million dollar piece of equipment or a $14 million dollar piece of equipment. Why?</p>

<p>Going back to the whitehouse.gov press release found here:
<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/05/02/press-briefing-senior-administration-officials-killing-osama-bin-laden">http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/05/02/press-briefing-senior-administration-officials-killing-osama-bin-laden</a></p>

<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: &quot;During the raid, we lost one helicopter due to <strong>mechanical failure</strong>. The aircraft was destroyed by the crew and the assault force and crew members boarded the remaining aircraft to exit the compound. All non-combatants were moved safely away from the compound before the detonation.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Q Yes, hey, how are you doing? My question would be, what was the type of the helicopter that failed? And what was the nature of that mechanical failure?</p>

<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Can’t go into details at this time.</p>

<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: <strong>We didn’t say it was mechanical.</strong></p>

<p>This wouldn&#39;t bother me so much if it wasn&#39;t such a small thing that turns into something weird. Why go to the trouble to blow up a $35 million dollar (assuming it was a Chinook) piece of equipment with remote detonated explosives.</p>

<p>Another thing that needs to be pointed out is crew sizes and capacity. The media has established that 20-25 SEALS were sent into the operation.  The average flight crew for a Chinook is 4 people. The average flight crew for a UH-60 Blackhawk:</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikorsky_UH-60_Black_Hawk#Variants">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikorsky_UH-60_Black_Hawk#Variants</a>&#39;</p>

<p>&quot;UH-60A Black Hawk: Original U.S. Army version, carrying a crew of four and up to 11 equipped troops&quot;</p>

<p>So in both helicopter scenarios 4 crew members are needed. Two helicopters are flown meaning there&#39;s 8 crew members. The media has stated anywhere from 20-25 SEALS were on board. The Chinook has a capacity of up to 26,000 lbs so god only knows how many people could be on board one.  I would imagine that based on the presumed 28-33 people (20 SEALS + 8 crewmen or 25 SEALS + 8 crewmen) that either way it is highly unlikely that 28 (or 33) men are all going to fit on one helicopter. Now I&#39;m not arguing that it&#39;s impossible, I&#39;m just saying it&#39;s unlikely. I can see the reasoning behind bringing 2 helicopters, but to destroy one and have 33 (or 28) fly back together seems strange. </p>

<p>5)The next thing that&#39;s bothering me is how close to the PMA Kakul (Pakistani Military Academy of Kakul) the compound is:</p>

<p><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=34.182308,+73.245075&amp;aq=&amp;sll=34.181977,73.245839&amp;sspn=0.006861,0.009645&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.183166,73.244895&amp;spn=0.006861,0.009645&amp;t=h&amp;z=17&amp;iwloc=A">http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=34.182308,+73.245075&amp;aq=&amp;sll=34.181977,73.245839&amp;sspn=0.006861,0.009645&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.183166,73.244895&amp;spn=0.006861,0.009645&amp;t=h&amp;z=17&amp;iwloc=A</a></p>

<p>Seen here where the arrow is over the compound and the PMA Kakul is listed at the corner of Arawami and Kakul roads. We&#39;re led to believe that no law enforcement, no soldiers no anyone got involved in this. Imagine this scene for me:</p>

<p>You see two helicopters fly overhead and drop at a compound just northwest of your position, fully armed guys get out (20-25 of them) and proceed to get into a firefight, not for 3 minutes like most STING operations, but 40 minutes....a completely lifetime in a battlezone....40 minutes of gun fire that leaves three men, osama, a girl who was being used as a human shield (???) and several others dead. Then the men turn around, blow up one of thier own helicopters over mechanical failure and leave? </p>

<p>It&#39;s just strange is all I&#39;m saying. </p>

<p>Edit:
*****I want to clarify that my main reason for having issues with this is the whitehouse.gov press report that states &#39;mechanical issue&#39; and then the guy goes right back and denies it. To me that could very well be such a non-issue that him denying it makes it suspicious to me. You guys have said plenty of things that could account for mechanical difficulties (the guy who said the helicopter being used a gas reserve and then not talking about it to prevent the range of travel from being known for example) and that&#39;s fine I guess but it just seems to me that it&#39;s odd for that very reason. Also I apologize for the rambling. I was really tired when I wrote this. </p>

<p>In fact Saddam did fight against Iran and then sort of against America. Not saying those are good things he did, but they are not &quot;cowardly&quot;</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong - I&#39;m not in love with Saddam, but I don&#39;t get calling him a coward. Think about what we did. We invaded a country, stormed its capital, and executed its leader. It&#39;s the opposite of a manhunt for a terrorist hiding in some remote compound. </p>

<p>I have to get this off my chest. I just want to point out a few discrepancies that are just really really bothering me:
1) Map of distance from Islamabad (35 miles south of the compound where he was found) to the North Arabian sea where he was supposedly buried at sea using <a href="http://www.distancefromto.net/">http://www.distancefromto.net/</a> , which unfortunately will not let me post a map to my knowledge, but tells me that from Islamabad to the Northern Arabian sea is roughly 900 miles.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>2) I want to establish that the media is reporting two different helicopter types were used: the Chinook and the Sikorsky MH-60 Blackhawk helicopters (personally I believe the latter as they&#39;re more for extraction and less for transporting large crews like the Chinook)
<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/05/the-secret-team-that-killed-osama-bin-laden/238163/">http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/05/the-secret-team-that-killed-osama-bin-laden/238163/</a>
first sentence : &quot;From Ghazi Air Base in Pakistan, the modified MH-60 helicopters made their way to the garrison suburb of Abbottabad, about 30 miles from the center of Islamabad. Aboard were Navy SEALs,&quot;
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_CH-47_Chinook#Iraq_and_Afghanistan">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_CH-47_Chinook#Iraq_and_Afghanistan</a>
&quot;On 1 May 2011, Chinook helicopters were used for carrying around two dozen US Navy SEALS into the compound where Osama bin Laden was staying. The overnight raid ended in the killing of Osama bin Laden&quot;
and now we establish the sources of chinook reporting: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=SEALS+chinook&amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;aq=t&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;amp;client=firefox-a#sclient=psy&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;hs=Z3P&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US%3Aofficial&amp;amp;source=hp&amp;amp;q=SEALS+chinook+osama&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;aqi=&amp;amp;aql=&amp;amp;oq=&amp;amp;pbx=1&amp;amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&amp;amp;fp=c9365e657b732f11&amp;amp;biw=1367&amp;amp;bih=685">http://www.google.com/search?q=SEALS+chinook&amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;aq=t&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;amp;client=firefox-a#sclient=psy&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;hs=Z3P&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US%3Aofficial&amp;amp;source=hp&amp;amp;q=SEALS+chinook+osama&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;aqi=&amp;amp;aql=&amp;amp;oq=&amp;amp;pbx=1&amp;amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&amp;amp;fp=c9365e657b732f11&amp;amp;biw=1367&amp;amp;bih=685</a>
you can see that for yourself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right. There was four helicopters. Two with a mix of DevGru and SOG/SAD and another two on standby that were PJ&#39;s should it be a trap or something goes horrifically wrong. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>3) now we establish the cost and specs of each: mh-60 Blackhawk Cost :14 million as you can see from the little box on the right there <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikorsky_UH-60_Black_Hawk">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikorsky_UH-60_Black_Hawk</a>
Speed: 222 mph top speed in good conditions <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikorsky_UH-60_Black_Hawk#Specifications_.28UH-60L.29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikorsky_UH-60_Black_Hawk#Specifications_.28UH-60L.29</a>
Chinook cost: average of $35 million <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_CH-47_Chinook">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_CH-47_Chinook</a>
top speed: 196 mph top speed in good conditions: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_CH7_Chinook#Specifications_.28CH-47D.29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_CH7_Chinook#Specifications_.28CH-47D.29</a>
So what we have here is a 900 (roughly) mile trip from Islamabad to the ocean to drop the body is completed in roughly 4 hours 6 minutes by the Blackhawk or 4.6 hours by the Chinook. Either way, you mean to tell me that the body was positively ID&#39;d in the 4 hours it was in flight?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No it wasn&#39;t. It was positively ID&#39;d on the aircraft carrier they landed on. The fire fight lasted 41 minutes, the flight back lasted just over four hours. We can assume five and a half hours if you really want to. That means that they had 18 to 19 hours left to do something, anything with the body. The brain of Osama&#39;s sister is in the hands of the FBI, and was to be used for DNA testing should they find him. Guess what? They did just that. The testing was done on the ship, and they already had a DNA reference to compare it to. This takes no more than 12 hours to do these days, even under less than ample conditions. The fact that they had a probable ID and the DNA reference to go, only made this happen faster. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>4) The reason I brought up the cost of the helicopter is to point out that the SEALS either detonated and destroyed a $35 million dollar piece of equipment or a $14 million dollar piece of equipment. Why?
Going back to the whitehouse.gov press release found here: <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/05/02/press-briefing-senior-administration-officials-killing-osama-bin-laden">http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/05/02/press-briefing-senior-administration-officials-killing-osama-bin-laden</a>
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: &quot;During the raid, we lost one helicopter due to mechanical failure. The aircraft was destroyed by the crew and the assault force and crew members boarded the remaining aircraft to exit the compound. All non-combatants were moved safely away from the compound before the detonation.&quot;
&quot;Q Yes, hey, how are you doing? My question would be, what was the type of the helicopter that failed? And what was the nature of that mechanical failure?
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Can’t go into details at this time.
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: We didn’t say it was mechanical.
This wouldn&#39;t bother me so much if it wasn&#39;t such a small thing that turns into something weird. Why go to the trouble to blow up a $35 million dollar (assuming it was a Chinook) piece of equipment with remote detonated explosives.
Another thing that needs to be pointed out is crew sizes and capacity. The media has established that 20-25 SEALS were sent into the operation. The average flight crew for a Chinook is 4 people. The average flight crew for a UH-60 Blackhawk:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikorsky_UH-60_Black_Hawk#Variants">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikorsky_UH-60_Black_Hawk#Variants</a>&#39;
&quot;UH-60A Black Hawk: Original U.S. Army version, carrying a crew of four and up to 11 equipped troops&quot;
So in both helicopter scenarios 4 crew members are needed. Two helicopters are flown meaning there&#39;s 8 crew members. The media has stated anywhere from 20-25 SEALS were on board. The Chinook has a capacity of up to 26,000 lbs so god only knows how many people could be on board one. I would imagine that based on the presumed 28-33 people (20 SEALS + 8 crewmen or 25 SEALS + 8 crewmen) that either way it is highly unlikely that 28 (or 33) men are all going to fit on one helicopter. Now I&#39;m not arguing that it&#39;s impossible, I&#39;m just saying it&#39;s unlikely. I can see the reasoning behind bringing 2 helicopters, but to destroy one and have 33 (or 28) fly back together seems strange.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because destroying U.S. military equipment in the event of an accident is quite literally priority one after retrieval. You do not let equipment fall into anyone else&#39;s hands, no matter how innocuous it might be. Let&#39;s not forget that we technically did declare war on Pakistan with this mission since it violated their sovereign rights. By calling this a joint operation however, Obama has successfully routed this issue. Also, no it isn&#39;t strange. This is done regularly during emergency and you can find dozens of videos and recorded instances of people literally flying on the outside of these helicopters should the situation require it. These were flown by the best pilots we have with the most hardcore operators in the military. Death does not scare them, bringing back this target&#39;s body at any cost would have been well worth it for them. As for the crash landing of the helicopter? That is the only really vague question remaining. They could have done a hard landing and fucked up the chassis (this can happen), they could have had a legitimate mechanical failure (this has happened during clandestine operations before, Operation Eagle Claw), or the pilot could have lost control due to the extremely poor landing area, hit the compound and crashed. I am going with the last one since there were complaints of how difficult the area was to drop the DevGru and SOG/SAD operators off at. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>5)The next thing that&#39;s bothering me is how close to the PMA Kakul (Pakistani Military Academy of Kakul) the compound is:
<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;source=s_q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=34.182308,+73.245075&amp;amp;aq=&amp;amp;sll=34.181977,73.245839&amp;amp;sspn=0.006861,0.009645&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=34.183166,73.244895&amp;amp;spn=0.006861,0.009645&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=17&amp;amp;iwloc=A">http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;source=s_q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=34.182308,+73.245075&amp;amp;aq=&amp;amp;sll=34.181977,73.245839&amp;amp;sspn=0.006861,0.009645&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=34.183166,73.244895&amp;amp;spn=0.006861,0.009645&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=17&amp;amp;iwloc=A</a>
Seen here where the arrow is over the compound and the PMA Kakul is listed at the corner of Arawami and Kakul roads. We&#39;re led to believe that no law enforcement, no soldiers no anyone got involved in this. Imagine this scene for me:
You see two helicopters fly overhead and drop at a compound just northwest of your position, fully armed guys get out (20-25 of them) and proceed to get into a firefight, not for 3 minutes like most STING operations, but 40 minutes....a completely lifetime in a battlezone....40 minutes of gun fire that leaves three men, osama, a girl who was being used as a human shield (???) and several others dead. Then the men turn around, blow up one of thier own helicopters over mechanical failure and leave?
It&#39;s just strange is all I&#39;m saying.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right. This is the Syria situation in 2007 all over again. We&#39;ve done this before. Pakistan goes, &quot;I don&#39;t know what the fuck they did, they&#39;re Western Wizards or something!&quot; defers blame to our superior technology and preserves relations with current foreign threats. Or fuck. Maybe they are just completely incompetent. I&#39;d say it is about a 50/50 chance. Hopefully I&#39;ve set your mind at ease, but this was just a perfect operation done perfectly by some of the most well trained and informed military groups on the planet. Nothing in the history of modern military operations has ever gone so perfect as this scenario. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uh. There was live video of it. There was video and photographs taken at the scene, of the autopsy and of the body being tossed out into the ocean. Muslim burial rites respected, of course. It just hasn&#39;t been released yet. I have a feeling you are comparing the Sadam situation to this. That is stupid, you aren&#39;t stupid for thinking this way, but the comparison itself is stupid. Allow me to explain why:</p>

<p>DevGru and the SAD/SOG aren&#39;t acknowledged by the U.S. Government. They have total deniability. Notice in the news that we&#39;ve only heard &#39;CIA lead SEAL teams&#39;? That&#39;s because that is all they can say. This isn&#39;t wholly inaccurate, but it isn&#39;t accurate either. So back to Sadam. Sadam was found by a team of lucky grunts out on patrol. They snapped photos of him, they have families they can go visit, they have Facebook pages. Besides the fact that they were out in a desert in fatigues, we are talking about Average Joes. It&#39;d be like a fisherman pulling in a massive catch. Of course they&#39;d shoot pictures. Now the hanging of Sadam? That wasn&#39;t carried out by the U.S., that was Iraq through and through and we only have video of that because a guy snuck in a camera phone. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you understand who DevGru and the SAD/SOG are. These are people who, probably existed at some point, but don&#39;t exist anymore. It may sound like I&#39;m exaggerating, but I&#39;m not. These people do not exist officially. Their identities are carefully protected with the strictest measures, before any photos can be released, before any audio can be released, before any video can be released, before anything can be released the most careful measures to protect against compromising identities must be undertaken. These people are professionals to an extent that is staggering, there would be no leaks of information before it was time do so. Not from these guys. </p>

<p>There is talk of the video and photos being released soon, but I doubt it will happen because that sort of negates the careful steps taken to minimize damage. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> meant to say &quot;do not exist&quot; instead of &quot;do exist&quot;. </p>

Ideally you bring back ringleaders and such, send them to Hague and put them on trial but that wouldn&#39;t have happened. OBL was a polarizing figure. The politicians here would have wanted OBL in America (or Guantanamo), the U.N. would have wanted him sent to Hague. The original plan, the one that Obama&#39;s security council told him to use, was just to bomb the compound with B2&#39;s dropping 2,000 pound JDAM&#39;s. So, he would have died either way. Just this way we have more evidence to say we killed him. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is true, but people still do visit grave sites. A lot of the fighting we see between Palestine and Israel is over the possible locations of places where some people might have been buried. Maybe.

<p>I&#39;ve never heard of these. Can you explain more? Are they officially US military? How are they organized? </p>

<div class="comment mb-3 ml-4" data-depth="4" data-id="c1s99nf">
    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">5</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../user/[deleted].html">[deleted]</a> 2011-05-03</p>
    <div class="md"><p>Sure.</p>

<p>DevGru used to be known by the name SEAL Team 6. They are a Tier 1 Special Operations group, there are three tiers to the system. This list here: <a href="http://i53.tinypic.com/2wec5e8.png">Tier List</a> is mostly accurate, the only problem is it doesn&#39;t include the ISA but they don&#39;t really belong to any branch of the armed forces. They are the only Tier 1 intel group while the USAF 24th is a support group that does the piloting. So there are four Tier 1 groups total, but only two of them put boots on the ground and carry out the missions. At the top of the list you have an unknown tier of special operations, that is SAD/SOG. They belong to the CIA and consist of people recruited out of Delta (Tier 1) and DevGru (Tier 1) plus normal CIA operatives. For the record, tier does not mean better skilled. The tiers are merely there for the levels of black area they work in. Tier 1 = Black missions. Tier 2 = Grey missions. Tier 3 = White missions. The more denial needed for a mission, the higher up the tiers you go. </p>

<p>In addition to this, SOF units in the U.S. are numerous as a mother fucker. There are several not listed on this graph but they are all pretty much Tier 3 and Tier 2 guys, so it doesn&#39;t matter. Every single SOF group is trained in particular fields. For most part, a lot of them receive much of the same general training (taken to different degrees and different lengths with different methods), but then you need to specialize. The human body can only specialize in so many things. So when people wonder why we have so many SOF groups, it is because for the most part they do different things. Think of a scalpel tray in an operating room, most of the scalpels will look the same at first glance but when you really look at them they are different. And it is the subtle difference in them that makes one more apt for a mission than the other. </p>

<p>Green Berets are excellent at working within the populace to set up rebel networks, or support previously established ones. They are also wonderful at helping the general populace get used to a prolonged American presence. These are the dudes that the native populations tend to like because they let them do more for themselves. CCT&#39;s for example are one of the smallest SOF groups there is. I&#39;d go so far as to reckon they could possibly be the smallest since DevGru, Delta, and SOG/SAD&#39;s numbers are classified. Their job is to be pathfinders, navigators, and to call in air support. CCT&#39;s are extremely skilled operators in their own right, but they are also one of the few military units that is usually seen being protected by everyone else due to their important role. </p>

<p>So back to the official nature of DevGru, SAD/SOG, and Delta. Well, I can say for sure that the U.S. government does not acknowledge the actions of all three. I also know that they do not acknowledge DevGru, and Delta as existing, but... SAD/SOG is something else.</p>

<p>As for the organization, that varies. I couldn&#39;t even start with SAD/SOG because I know so little about them. DevGru and Delta change so frequently that the only info we have on their structure is a decade or two old. Those aren&#39;t even likely their names anymore. We just call them that since it was the last official name used. At one point though Delta was structured like the SAS, but I have heard that was officially changed thanks to Cheney. I can&#39;t cite that last bit, but that&#39;s what I&#39;ve heard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not arguing you in any way, you seem to have a lot of relevant information that I&#39;m very interested in. Would you be able to give me sources of information pertaining to:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Right. There was four helicopters. Two with a mix of DevGru and SOG/SAD and another two on standby that were PJ&#39;s should it be a trap or something goes horrifically wrong</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve not read anything saying anything other than two helicopters and DevGru guys. Not disputing you, just want to read more of what you&#39;re citing. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>That means that they had 18 to 19 hours left to do something, anything with the body. The brain of Osama&#39;s sister is in the hands of the CIA, and was to be used for DNA testing should they find him. Guess what? They did just that. The testing was done on the ship, and they already had a DNA reference to compare it to. This takes no more than 12 hours to do these days, even under less than ample conditions. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve not seen anything to establish a timeline of 18 to 19 hours, everything I&#39;ve seen was 5-6 hours. Also the thing about his sister&#39;s brain? where is that from because that&#39;s really interesting to think about. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because destroying U.S. military equipment in the event of an accident is quite literally priority one after retrieval. You do not let equipment fall into anyone else&#39;s hands, no matter how innocuous it might be.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and that&#39;s fully understandable I guess? Lots of people are saying that but where can information about that issued by the military be obtained, like a field ops manual or something related in the past. My interpretation has always been that so so much gear was left in Vietnam that had to be brought back after the fact but I fully concede that this is a topic I know very very little about beyond my own speculation and conjecture. </p>

<p>Also, more than anything else I&#39;d like to know more about your background because you seem like you have a military background and some interesting things to say/stories to tell. </p>

<p>Please don&#39;t misconstrue this, I&#39;m not being a dick, I&#39;m really interested in learning relevant material. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So the four helicopters (two modified Black Hawks, maybe Sea Hawks) and two Chinooks along with PJ&#39;s as back up originally comes from this: </p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/03/world/asia/03intel.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/03/world/asia/03intel.html</a></p>

<p>NYT tossed out the most accurate numbers. Other information regarding PJ&#39;s was from... shit, I think Telegraph. I&#39;m having trouble remember where I read that. However that article is pretty much the basis for this entire operation&#39;s numbers and the vehicles involved. Only four copters would make this work. The rumor of two of the copters being Chinooks also fits this operation. Chinooks have a carrying capacity of anywhere between 30 to 50 people. Blawk Hawks can carry a few over a dozen each. Everyone is reporting just over two dozen DevGru and SOG/SAD people on the ground attacking the compound. This fits the numbers two Black Hawks can carry. One of the Black Hawks crashed. So you need to get the other half of the personnel out, how? The Chinooks. There&#39;s nothing conflicting with this. Even if the numbers are well below the assumed count by the NYT, and there was only four Black Hawks then it works. As I said earlier, in an emergency you can cram more people inside and put people on the outside of the copters. </p>

<p>As for the brain, that story was run by ABC. Since then there was an update where they couldn&#39;t substantiate the claim that his sister was in the hospital they claimed she was. However, when inquired about this the FBI hasn&#39;t denied the story either. I accidentally said it was in the hands of the CIA last night. So, allow me to correct for that. Story with update:</p>

<p><a href="http://thephoenix.com/BLOGS/phlog/archive/2011/05/02/osama-s-sister-s-brain-the-boston-connection.aspx">http://thephoenix.com/BLOGS/phlog/archive/2011/05/02/osama-s-sister-s-brain-the-boston-connection.aspx</a></p>

<p>The exact timeline to my knowledge hasn&#39;t been nailed down yet, but I expect it to be. My 18-19 hours was just to remark how much time they had to do things. Not how long it took for them to dispose of the body.</p>

<p>Although I don&#39;t feel like diving through Army manuals on the correct procedure to destroy equipment, but this is done regularly. If you want a pretty well known example, just look up all of the Abrams we destroyed because they were disabled. Or I&#39;ll do it for you:</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_M1_Abrams#Gulf_War">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_M1_Abrams#Gulf_War</a></p>

<p>And no, I don&#39;t have a military background or will even claim to. I&#39;m not some 1337 OPERATOR LOLOL, despite the fact I wish I was, haha. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I beg to differ:</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uday_Hussein">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uday_Hussein</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Uday Saddam Hussein al-Tikriti (18 June 1964 – 22 July 2003), (Arabic: عُدي صدّام حُسين‎) was the elder son of Saddam Hussein and his first wife, Sajida Talfah. He was the brother of Qusay Hussein. Uday was for several years seen as the heir apparent of his father; however, Uday lost this due to his erratic behavior and troubled relationship with his father and brother. Following the United States-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, <strong>he was killed along with Qusay by a secretive combined Special Forces Task Force (Task Force 20) during a brief gunfight in Mosul.</strong></p>

<p>...</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>The U.S. Administration released graphic pictures of the brothers&#39; bodies. When criticized, the U.S. military&#39;s response was to point out that these men were no ordinary combatants and to express hope that confirmation of the deaths would bring closure to the Iraqi people.[18]</p>

My point is that once we know it is a fake I don&#39;t understand how adding detail after detail moves us forward.  Granted we are only a few days later so its still relevant but I want to know for example what the next false flag event is so that I 1) survive it and 2) profit from it.  His death is fake fake fake, I get it.  Wanting to move on at some point in the future doesn&#39;t mean that I have no attention span.

    <div class="md"><p>If only sighs were my experience.  I&#39;m met with sharp opposition and fury.  An practical example would be trying to get my family to buy some gold or silver either physical, mining shares or ETFs.  Nope, they won&#39;t have any of it.  I&#39;ve begged them to get 1-2% into these things back when the price was $700-900.  Now its approaching $1600.  Do I get a nod of recognition?  Not even in the slightest.  Their small box is built with reinforced titanium polymers (and maybe alien nano-technology?).  There is zero approval and zero validation as I become increasing right and as we move closer to what people on this subreddit know is coming.  So I&#39;m focusing on y&#39;all folks here, who are at least interested (not to say that I know everything at all).  Everybody has their own audience.  For me my ideas and words in any format provoke extreme anger in average folks so that is not my cause.  So I&#39;m not on a holy mission to save everyone.  Seriously I&#39;m quite pessimistic and I think that the drugged out baby boomers need to just die off and that situation will take care of itself without me lifting a finger.  I believe that Americas crash is guaranteed.  I think that we would already be in it now if the free market were allowed to flourish.  Then perhaps we would have some difficult several years and the next generation would not even need to worry about about the shit that we have to deal with.  Well though just look around you.  These people are not capable of stopping what is coming.  I might be willing to return to help with the rebuilding but I refuse to be here when things are full on bad.  The disparity between what I will be perceiving and what others around me will be perceiving will be too great and I will feel too alienated to be of much use.  I can deal with the alienation but I don&#39;t see the point.  I&#39;ve had an audience of thirty Chinese before who were very eager to here me speak about anything that I wanted.  Compared to here (US) it is an astronomically large difference.   I have enough cultural experience and reference points to know how good things can be and I have more faith in other parts of the world than I do the US.  I think that probably the renaissance will not begin in the US but in other parts.  Also I am of European ancestry who has only been here four generations.  We celebrate the brave people who came here long ago to escape the futile and brutal conditions in their lands but now we denounce anybody who leaves here in that same vein to simply shed the great weight.  We are not entitled to be relevant, interesting or prepared.  Basically I am ready for a revolution but obviously others are not because they still feel like the system is serving them more than it is hindering them.  So there needs to be some kind of consensus there and obviously there is currently no such thing.  Also I am a master of computer technology so my location on the planet is not of much importance for me to contribute and also I am not the best at navigating the mind field of common perception.  There are hundreds of implanted trigger words that set people off and I will leave that to others more skilled in that art.  I speak to the aware and anything beyond that is beyond aggravating for me.</p>

<p>Anyways, I type quickly.</p>

<p>[edit] Additionally Americans have religious faith in their Illuminati paper.  There is not cure for this delusion except hyper inflation and misery.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if it was fake, but I recall seeing the leaked execution video of Saddam Hussein. Assuming it was genuine, how come that was leaked but we can&#39;t get a single toe from Osama Bin Laden? I&#39;ll continue to believe that it never happened. Know why? Because most politicians are liars, and I&#39;d rather eat shit for telling the truth than have my ass wiped by George Bush for lying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a great post and exactly the sort of thing most threads in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> lack: proper skepticism, an attempt at rationalism, and actual sources. </p>

<p>That said, let&#39;s take some of your points into consideration:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The reason I brought up the cost of the helicopter is to point out that the SEALS either detonated and destroyed a $35 million dollar piece of equipment or a $14 million dollar piece of equipment. Why?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reason these machines cost so many millions of dollars is because of the serious hi-tech equipment they&#39;re filled with: weaponry, guidance systems, positioning systems, state-of-the-art shielding, and so on. If it crashes and it can&#39;t reasonably be protected until it&#39;s recovered, the only way to stop that technology being scavenged by insurgents is to blow the thing up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Either way, you mean to tell me that the body was positively ID&#39;d in the 4 hours it was in flight?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The body didn&#39;t necessarily need to be identified while in flight, DNA samples can be taken and checked later on.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I would imagine that based on the presumed 28-33 people (20 SEALS + 8 crewmen or 25 SEALS + 8 crewmen) that either way it is highly unlikely that 28 (or 33) men are all going to fit on one helicopter. Now I&#39;m not arguing that it&#39;s impossible, I&#39;m just saying it&#39;s unlikely. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="http://www.fas.org/programs/ssp/man/uswpns/air/rotary/ch47chinook.html">Federation of American Scientists</a> say that the CH47 is capable (depend on the configuration) of carrying as many as 44 seated troops. Bear in mind also that in a situation like this where there&#39;s no other line of retreat, nobody&#39;s complaining about being crammed in like sardines or not having enough leg room :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Going back to the whitehouse.gov press release found here:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Official may have just misspoken and didn&#39;t realise he&#39;d said &quot;mechanical failure&quot; in the earlier sentence, or perhaps he did realise but wasn&#39;t meant to have revealed it was mechanical failure and was trying to reassert that he wasn&#39;t confirming it at all. This is just speculation, of course. I&#39;m curious to know what significance you think this part has?</p>

<p>With regards to the rest of your post, I don&#39;t have any reasonable answer regarding PMA Kakul because I&#39;m not familiar enough with it to speculate, but maybe someone else can chime in.</p>

<p>Again, your post is fantastic and it&#39;s awesome that you went to the trouble to actually find sources and do the work. </p>

<p>I guess the biggest issue I have with that train of thought, and I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s wrong, is that you heard about the Russians having a fire sale after the cold war of all the Soviet weapons and arms, you hear about China getting a hold of things from pakistan, you hear about this tech trading all the time. You hear about Brazil requesting chinook helicopters to buy from other governments, I mean you would imagine that at this point tech is tech and just about everyone&#39;s got the same stuff. I mean we&#39;re talking about Pakistan, a largely militarily active country in a relatively dangerous and active place, to me and this is purely conjecture, wouldn&#39;t pakistan have the same crap?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem isn&#39;t (just) the Pakistani military getting a hold of technology, it&#39;s insurgents and &quot;terrorists&quot; scavenging the wreck that they&#39;re worried about. Also, whether the level of technology involved is a factor or not, you certainly don&#39;t want to increase the amount of weaponry the other side has if you can avoid it, and I imagine that chopper had a bunch of missiles and other weapons that could have been scavenged.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you should feel stupid for being honest and trying to inquire about something, that&#39;s the hallmark of a true skeptic and someone who values rationality. It would be silly to ignore evidence and make wild assumptions and treat them as fact, but that&#39;s not what you&#39;re doing -- you have questions, and you&#39;re looking for answers. </p>

I&#39;m paranoid and a cynic but when I read this and hear it over and over it screams assassination.  Was it a movie moment when he had the woman as a shield and a brave SEAL took out his .45 and BAM!  One shot one kill?  Maybe he was shot in the back of the head and that&#39;s why they couldn&#39;t keep the body.  All speculative of course...I&#39;m just saying I don&#39;t like it when everyone keeps reaffirming something.  I&#39;ve known some pathological liars that do the same.  Yours truly included.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Blowing up a downed aircraft is common practice by the U.S. military. They have the largest budget in the world so the price tag means nothing. It&#39;s simply a piece of equipment, especially in the case of a &quot;dime a dozen&quot; helicopter.  We aren&#39;t talking about a B-2 or F-22 here, but they would blow those up too. They don&#39;t want the enemy to use them and they don&#39;t want other countries to get a hold of potentially advanced technology inside of it.</p>

<p>To fuel your conspiracy though... I&#39;m an air traffic controller, I&#39;ve never seen a helo fly at 190mph. 110-130kts is a more realistic cruising speed. That converts to 126-150mph.</p>

Who says the first thing they did with the body was bury it at sea. Have you considered that they took it to a closer airbase before taking it to an aircraft carrier where it was &quot;buried&quot;? You say it all needed to happen in 4 hours but what if it took longer by taking the body to a base first where it is identified?</p>

<p>The real question here is that why didnt the US take him alive.  He was trapped in a room and unarmed.  Couldn&#39;t these SEALS toss a couple of flash grenades in there and grab him?  Why didn&#39;t the US government want him brought back to face trial?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I&#39;ve been thinking is that the whole thing was not an ambush and in fact it was a battle. Which ruins the sort of spin you&#39;d want to put on this kind of thing to make the conquering heroes look like ninjas who came in the night, took care of business and departed without disturbing a leaf of grass. Because that kind of thing sells. The image of these guys showing up, getting into a fire fight and having mortars or RPG&#39;s shot at the helicopters makes it look a lot less flawless and therefore less controlled. If this was a capture mission it would have been a capture (so we&#39;re to be told anyway) instead it seems a lot like a massacre in the night (so we&#39;re to be told anyway). I subscribe to the same sort of thinking that maybe he was going to start running his mouth and they wanted him gone for good. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>DEVGRU (aka SEAL Team 6, or ST6) would have most likely been brought in on MH-60L by the Army&#39;s 160th SOAR.  These have extender tanks, getting them a range of ~500 miles, but they certainly have in-flight refueling capacity.  They also have a higher top and cruise speed than the standard HH-60 due to upgraded engines..  They carry 4 crew, and up to 12 pax. This means two helos were used to get them in.  A third helo (supposedly) was brought in to assist with extraction.  Let&#39;s say 20 DEVGRU and 8 crew.  1 helo lost adds 4 crew to be extracted, for a total of 24 for extraction...  That fits perfectly onto two MH-60L.  They would bring an extra &quot;empty&quot; helo for backup purposes, and may have had a 4th with additional DEVGRU should it be necessary.</p>

<p>The destruction of the aircraft left behind would be necessary, in order to prevent cryptographic (especially the HaveQuick units) equipment from falling into enemy hands.  The other amounts of tech on the aircraft is insignificant.</p>

<p>I would say that this is nothing but a well-executed mission that had a singular small speedbump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think an over arching point to this is that we don&#39;t know (or I, personally, have not heard/seen) the exact minute by minute schedule of how and when things happened.</p>

<p>So that the time frames involved are not clear yet.  That makes it hard to talk about distances, just yet...</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to assume that the direct combat operations were done via helicopter as we have heard and been told.   But I&#39;m also going to assume that there was a covert staging center nearby that quite possibly had jet transport waiting on the ground.    I&#39;m absolutely completely making this up, and have never heard them say it, but I think its un reasonable to assume they flew 900 miles by helo with the heavy load they have.   The choppers don&#39;t have the flight range either.   Ferry range of 1,380 mi.    Combat radius is 368mi (both from your wikipedia article).</p>

<p>which takes me directly to ...</p>

<p>(personal conjecture) I think the destroyed helo was a fuel tanker to increase the range of the other 3 combat transports.   They drained it of all its fuel to reac the location, and then destroyed it since it had used its purpose.   Destroying it protects the sensitive avionics on board the craft, and also allows them to make a diversion.   The &quot;mechanical failure&quot; story is a cover.  Simply because if they say that it was a fuel tanker, it gives people a &quot;range&quot; of operations, and they can figure out how SEAL TEAM 6 does its dirty work. </p>

<p>As for how many people that were being transported.   I agree with you that 3 choppers is a tight fit for that many people.  Though the fuel tanker may just have had 2 on board, and I think they only took 2 or 3 people captive.</p>

<p>Combined with the number &quot;25&quot; I heard for how many SEAL Operators were involved, thats
2+3+25 = 30.</p>

<p>Wikipedia says that each Blackhawk can carry 14 troops.</p>

<p>These are all rough numbers based on my own reading/hearing, but I there is plenty of room in the remaining 3 choppers to carry the 30 persons + captured assets. (body, computer equipment, physical documents).</p>

<p>In conclusion.
1. The idea that they used 4 Blackhawks (of some modfication, I&#39;m sure) to assault the compound makes perfect sense.   Because of operational range, I made up the idea that one of them was a fuel tanker that was intended to be destroyed.
2. Because of the 900 mile range back to the Carl Vincent in the Arabian Sea, I&#39;m guessing they had jet transport waiting for them somewhere near by.   What kind of jet?  no idea.   Maybe they got on an S3 transport, and went right to the carrier.   Or maybe they got in something ground based, and transfered one more time to a carrier based plane before getting to the Carl Vincent.
Its the ONLY thing I can guess that makes sense for the time frames they were talking about.</p>

<p>Additionally.
Obama didn&#39;t get up and speak until they had CONFIRMATION of his body being his.  (assuming you beleive that, this is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, afterall).  So operations had been in motion for a while before we knew anything was up.   Unless you were randomly fowllowing that guy on twitter who was live blogging the event before he realized what was going on in his home town...  <a href="http://www.reallyvirtual.com/the-guy-who-liveblogged-the-osama-raid-without-knowing-it/">http://www.reallyvirtual.com/the-guy-who-liveblogged-the-osama-raid-without-knowing-it/</a></p>

<p>With all that said.   Blowing up one of these is a operational decision, its pennies compared to the worth of the success of the mission.</p>

<p>So, ignoring the ideas that Osama&#39;s been dead for years... and that this was just a show piece for the media... I think this makes the most sense.  To me, based on the idea that they&#39;re not using superpowered jet helos out of a bad GI JOE movie...</p>

I heard there were FOUR helos involved in the op.  Not 3...   So maybe my numbers don&#39;t make sense if there were only 3 total (one left behnd).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK!</p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard reports of two or three helos. Can&#39;t really decide as to how many just yet. </p>

<p>First, the helicopters don&#39;t fly always at top speed. Find the cruise speed - they won&#39;t fly for forever at top speed, it&#39;s not as efficient. Likely, they have a base nearby, and either refueled or switched choppers to get to the ship that they dropped him off in the water. Afghanistan and India are right over the border, a long flight round trip, but there isn&#39;t a shortage of FOB&#39;s in Afghanistan IMO.</p>

<p>Second, they blow up the helicopter because leaving it is a greater risk. They don&#39;t want people to get their hands on it and reverse engineer their tech. It&#39;s a security thing. You can&#39;t fly it back, so don&#39;t leave it either. Planes go down all the time, what do they do? Bomb the fuck out of it. Likely, you&#39;ll kill enemy combatants trying to scavenge as well. </p>

<p>Third, I have a feeling that they used blackhawks - some people still think chinooks, but the pictures are showing a tail boom section at the compound. I&#39;m not sure if they used another helicopter other than that, but it&#39;s definitely not a chinook tail. Chinooks don&#39;t have tails, per se. </p>

<p>Fourth, say they used blackhawks. You really only need a pilot, co-pilot, and maybe a loadmaster type, for the rappelling dudes going out. Maybe. We&#39;re talking SEALS here, they don&#39;t really need a lot of support other than fly us in, let us do our thing, get us the fuck out. So, we&#39;ll assume they carry 15 dudes. 3 crew, 12 dudes - maybe only 2 crew, 13 dudes. Why would you need the two extra crew, if you&#39;re packed to the gills with seals - who likely are trained in some form as to what to do on the chopper. So 15 dudes. One chopper goes down, now you&#39;ve got to cram in 30 dudes into one chopper. Likely, &quot;OK LETS GTFO WE&#39;LL SORT OUT SHOTGUN ON THE WAY OUT!&quot; Plus a body. I think, personally, 3 blackhawks makes more sense. you get ~25 dudes on the ground + crew for all, then two choppers on the way back to split the extras. But even still, 4 crew, 10 dudes apiece for each blackhawk leaves 20 seals on the ground securing this bitch. Blackhawks are pretty large, but when you&#39;re in Pakistan, getting everyone out is priority.</p>

<p>Fifth, there likely wasn&#39;t any need to go all crazy at the nearby base, as choppers probably go in and out all the time. So, until you hear the gunfire, you don&#39;t freak. It took 40 minutes for the whole op. I doubt that there was gunfire for all forty of it. Otherwise, we probably wouldn&#39;t have any dudes to bring back home. I imagine 10 minutes, maybe a hair more, while they land, neutralize the threats, go in, kill Osama, then spend the next 30 getting intel in the way of HD&#39;s, papers, memos, whatever they can readily find, and getting back onboard and making sure everyone is accounted for. Let&#39;s not forget that they were taking fire as soon as they were over the compound, so likely both sides are shooting. Kill the dudes on the roofs, go kill everyone inside, sweep it up, clear it, get the intel, GTFO. </p>

<p>I see what you&#39;re getting at though - the news is pretty inconsistent. I mean, shit - we&#39;re hearing about it merely hours after it happened. Let&#39;s see what shakes out as we go. The thing that bothers me the most is that they dumped the body out in the ocean. And so fast. Although, I believe it because the last thing we want to do is piss off all muslims in the world. We already have enough crazy ones, why make millions angry?</p>

<p>Maybe we&#39;ll get lucky and get to watch the firefight cams. The pres watched that shit in real time with Joey Biden and Hill Clinton. So, the video exists, we just need to be able to see it now to be able to dissect it.</p>

<p>Edit: Weakgrip <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/h2tpd/some_stuff_that_is_bothering_me_about_the_whole/c1s6iqz">below,</a> has it on lockdown. I get that there are inconsistencies, and that&#39;s bothersome, but I really do think that it was a well executed snatch and grab op gone right. </p>

<p>Edit 2: What creeps me out, is hearing that this compound was built in 2005. 2005, let&#39;s remember, is the year that Bush closed down the unit hunting Bin Laden. So, after he was basically not wanted anymore, he gets to chill out in this compound. The Bush&#39;s and the Bin Ladens go way back - so I fear that our former president is just saving face by saying &quot;Hey guys! Good job!&quot; What a fucker.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m surprised there aren&#39;t even more posts like this, the whole thing is fishy. It seems likely that if he died recently and there were zero other casualties, then at the very least it probably wasn&#39;t a &quot;firefight&quot;, it was an assassination. Beyond that, the dna testing bit is fishy. They can do it in 4 hours, but that&#39;s the absolute bare minimum using a fairly new process that hasn&#39;t been approved for general use by law enforcement. And there&#39;s still the question of getting the sample there, which takes time. It can&#39;t be done on the helicopter, it needs good lab conditions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is interesting to me, is that if I were going to take credit for a Osama&#39;s death long after the fact (just once we had proof that he was definitely dead), I can&#39;t think of a better lead-in than to release the birth certificate a week earlier that has become such a major issue after being initially brought up by someone that would go on to be one of my closest allies (Hillary Clinton).</p>

<p>The report was that Bin Laden had been killed a week ago, which makes the releasing of the birth certificate pretty interestingly timed.  They released the birth certificate literally the day after &quot;he was killed,&quot; which takes the spot light for a few days, making anyone that would dare question what the Obama administration is doing look like a fool.  Now, the most wanted man in many years is assassinated and his body buried at sea, and those asking for proof are ridiculed as being like &quot;Birthers.&quot;  It is just all really convenient.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem people are falling into right now I think is believing too much of the initial reports.  We&#39;re simply too close to the actual events to make sense of all the details.  Right now every reporter that covers this type of thing is hungry for any possible detail they can print.  So anyone who will talk to them that can be credited along the lines of &quot;Senior Pentagon official&quot; or whatever is getting quotes.  This leads to a lot of bad information out there.</p>

<p>If you pay attention while a major emergency is going on, the initial reports are always wrong.  I can even count how many shootings I&#39;ve seen where the initial reports claim multiple shooters.  Almost every time there is a shooting, right away people are saying there are more than one shooter.  Almost always it turns out those reports were wrong.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll need to wait a few weeks before more concrete details have been released before trying to really parse what&#39;s been said and all the data that is available.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible that Osama did not want to be captured alive?  I am sure that I have read reports of exactly that - he was always armed, and his own men were under standing orders that he was not to be taken alive.</p>

<p>Another thing to remember is that this mission had a <strong>very</strong> limited amount of time that the operators could remain on the ground.  They were inside Pakistan, unannounced.  The Pakistani Air Force did, in fact, scramble jets looking for the US helicopters.  They could not just surround him, and wait him out.</p>

<p>Once you have accepted those two pieces of information, the outcome becomes a lot easier to accept.  Consider the following:</p>

<p>The SEAL team assaults the compound, with orders to capture Bin Laden if possible, and kill him otherwise.  Once they are on the ground, Bin Laden does <strong>not</strong> just surrender, and a firefight ensues.  During this firefight, they are under constant threat of being discovered by the Pakistani Armed forces.  The firefight is drawn out over 40 minutes, and the team is forced to go with option B - terminate Bin Laden, and collect his body / whatever intel they can get their hands on.</p>

<p>In the end, disposing of his body, as quickly as they did, might be a little suspicious, but their killing him is not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, think about this ... they must have had complete samples of Bin Laden&#39;s DNA in the freezer, ready to test. It&#39;s the only way they could verify the authenticity of what they took from the body. That means they could, in theory, have used that DNA and falsely claimed they extracted it from a fresh corpse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If only sighs were my experience.  I&#39;m met with sharp opposition and fury.  An practical example would be trying to get my family to buy some gold or silver either physical, mining shares or ETFs.  Nope, they won&#39;t have any of it.  I&#39;ve begged them to get 1-2% into these things back when the price was $700-900.  Now its approaching $1600.  Do I get a nod of recognition?  Not even in the slightest.  Their small box is built with reinforced titanium polymers (and maybe alien nano-technology?).  There is zero approval and zero validation as I become increasing right and as we move closer to what people on this subreddit know is coming.  So I&#39;m focusing on y&#39;all folks here, who are at least interested (not to say that I know everything at all).  Everybody has their own audience.  For me my ideas and words in any format provoke extreme anger in average folks so that is not my cause.  So I&#39;m not on a holy mission to save everyone.  Seriously I&#39;m quite pessimistic and I think that the drugged out baby boomers need to just die off and that situation will take care of itself without me lifting a finger.  I believe that Americas crash is guaranteed.  I think that we would already be in it now if the free market were allowed to flourish.  Then perhaps we would have some difficult several years and the next generation would not even need to worry about about the shit that we have to deal with.  Well though just look around you.  These people are not capable of stopping what is coming.  I might be willing to return to help with the rebuilding but I refuse to be here when things are full on bad.  The disparity between what I will be perceiving and what others around me will be perceiving will be too great and I will feel too alienated to be of much use.  I can deal with the alienation but I don&#39;t see the point.  I&#39;ve had an audience of thirty Chinese before who were very eager to here me speak about anything that I wanted.  Compared to here (US) it is an astronomically large difference.   I have enough cultural experience and reference points to know how good things can be and I have more faith in other parts of the world than I do the US.  I think that probably the renaissance will not begin in the US but in other parts.  Also I am of European ancestry who has only been here four generations.  We celebrate the brave people who came here long ago to escape the futile and brutal conditions in their lands but now we denounce anybody who leaves here in that same vein to simply shed the great weight.  We are not entitled to be relevant, interesting or prepared.  Basically I am ready for a revolution but obviously others are not because they still feel like the system is serving them more than it is hindering them.  So there needs to be some kind of consensus there and obviously there is currently no such thing.  Also I am a master of computer technology so my location on the planet is not of much importance for me to contribute and also I am not the best at navigating the mind field of common perception.  There are hundreds of implanted trigger words that set people off and I will leave that to others more skilled in that art.  I speak to the aware and anything beyond that is beyond aggravating for me.</p>

<p>Anyways, I type quickly.</p>

<p>[edit] Additionally Americans have religious faith in their Illuminati paper.  There is not cure for this delusion except hyper inflation and misery.</p>
