    <div class="md"><p>Its not absolutely a bad idea but for the majority case it will have a negative influence.  I have a computer science degree and I am always striving to utilize the most powerful, secure and free software and hardware.  Soon enough we will be able to print our own circuits and then there will be a movement for open source hardware to complement the open source software.  Already we are close to having open source firmware for all  computers through the Coreboot project.  Today I can run all open source software using state of the art security and privacy systems and browse anonymously with networks like tor.  Bitcoin is introducing some new currency constructs that will surely evolve over time.</p>

<p>So the way that I look at it if you have a hammer you can choose to be slave or an independent contractor.  Most people will be slaves, probably forever.  You can&#39;t stop the tools from evolving.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well, think about it.  If everything is touch screen, you&#39;ll be paying out the ass for everything.  Right now, I can watch movies for free.  I can read newspaper for free and the reason is because people are able to make programs and software.  There is an open-source community.  If you are unable to make software independently without microsoft or apple&#39;s approval, you&#39;ll have to pay to read the newspaper, watch movies, or do anything online.  Everything will be subscription based.  It&#39;ll be like, &quot;hey, have you paid your $5 yahoo subscription?&quot;    Touch screen = closed source operating systems.  Things that are closed like that are unable to have independent-free software created for them.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The British Empire (which I believe is the one in question here) never really fell. After WWII, Britain simply &quot;gave&quot; autonomy to its colonies, as compared to France, who were engaged in a number of costly wars around the globe.

<p>Religious freedoms were but 1 of the reasons albeit a big one. Taxation without representation was <em>THE</em> main reason and another lesser known reason was to escape the corrupt banks.</p>

<p>&quot;The refusal of King George to allow the colonies to operate an honest money system, which freed the ordinary man from clutches of the money manipulators was probably the prime cause of the revolution.&quot;</p>

<p>This has been quoted from Franklin but likely not written by him rather quoted him as saying, perhaps for a biography. </p>

<p>Basically, it wasnt the tax that sent them over the edge. It was the refusal of being allowed to print/use their own money and King George imposing british money on the colonies.</p>

I had a hard time grabbing an edge on any spin where my old deck would have put me in the hospital. It did get noodely at a higher speed and felt more unstable then the HP board I&#39;ve got and its 5 years old.</p>

<p>The hippies saw war and environmental destruction bring our end.</p>

<p>The anti-globalization protestors saw the 90&#39;s as devestating.</p>

<p>This is just another phase where &#39;extreme measures&#39; by the government will be imposed on us, our taxes will go up, our freedoms will be stripped away, and next decade there will be another threat (most likely food, water or oil) that will mean a further impedement on our lives.</p>

Keeping up with all that&#39;s going on just brings down my quality of life. Spreading the word feels pointless, people have already made up their minds. I have so many problems of my own and a family to care for. What am I supposed to do with all the intonation I know? The more I learn about the way things work, the more I realize I know so fucking little. What am I supposed to do? I hold two jobs, work 60+ hrs a week, am in massive student loan debt, have to provide for my parents, live with them cause I have no other choice, can&#39;t afford health insurance, etc. What the fuck can I really do? Everything seems so twisted and ugly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, we&#39;re fucked. The people running the show have made a total mess of the economy, and they are now turning Western nations into neo-fascist states, where the big money interests control the legislation the politicians pass into laws. The whole Free Trade philosophy that began under Ronald Reagan was just a way for the corporations to move manufacturing overseas where there was cheaper labor. It benefited the rich, but hurt the greater mass of the population. And it hurt the country. Now we have a situation where the economy is geared to war -- where invading and occupying foreign nations for no particular reason is what keeps the greased wheels of the war machine turning. Lots of jobs in the military. Lots of jobs making weapons to give to Israel, so that the Zionists can kill people in their homes at long distance. Lots of jobs building cruise missiles to blow up houses in Pakistan. And it is all completely and utterly insane. It will collapse in upon itself, and soon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This morning&#39;s job number was horrendous.  Given the 280 pt slide the other day in the Dow and now with futures down around 140 pre-open, we think that this is the official start of the double dip that everyone&#39;s been waiting for.  Housing prices are still falling, foreclosures are still occuring and show no signs of slowing, and firms and households are still way too overleveraged.  Overleveraged households means that consumer spending will stay weak as consumers pay down their debts instead of increasing consumption to precrisis levels.  Overleveraged firms have a double incentive to not expand production: no demand for increased goods/services, and their balance sheets still being a mess due to the enormous fall in asset prices that the crisis brought upon the corporate sector.  Firms figure that if there&#39;s no demand for their products/services, they&#39;ll just use their cash to quietly fix their insolvent balance sheets, leaving unemployment stagnant.</p>

<p>TL;DR - It&#39;s going to get a lot worse in America before it gets better.  Japan&#39;s real estate bubble popped in 1990, and it essentially took them until 2005 to recover (only to be smacked by the US&#39;s real estate bubble, and then an earthquake, and then a tsunami, and then a nuclear crisis)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am of the opinion that for the past three decades the US has been moving increasingly to the political right, putting corporate interests before the public interest, and passing increasingly draconian legislation. I predict barring any major financial collapse, massive environmental disaster, energy or resource crisis; (but quite possibly in conjunction with these events) as the gap between the haves and have-nots widens, there will eventually arise a leftist cultural revolution. I am basing much of my opinion on how various revolutions across the world throughout history were sparked and primarily on the start of the Spanish revolution.</p>

<p>A land, wealth, and resource controlling elite can only tighten their grip so firmly to control their serfs and slaves. It is the greed of the elite that will be their own undoing. Unless they are able to use technology and their wealth effectively to keep the left oppressed, divided, and confused. Unity and a common shared vision among liberal types will be key to a successful cultural revolution. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I definitely agree it could take decades for conditions to become dire enough for citizens to take action. I think its a possibility that by then the means of control and oppression will become more effective and may stave off revolt indefinitely. The elite want the masses to be as placid and servile as cattle. However, advances in technology also have the potential to free us from that servitude. I can see that if the elite feel threatened enough, they may result to fomenting massive wars, releasing bio weapons, or creating some other crisis to ensure their success and survival, while they hide in bunkers underground. The elite have threatened and attempted in the past to plunge society into chaos and panic when backed into a corner.</p>

<p>I agree, but not only that -- from historical example, it looks like this process of gradually morphing into a totalitarian state is self-perpetuating once it gets past a certain point.

    <div class="md"><p>For an example of what we are going through, look up Easter Island. The reason why we are collapsing is because of the greatest meme ever to be created, the meme of civilization. If you&#39;re familiar with Daniel Quinn, he states it as follows &quot;Civilization is the only way in which humanity and proceed, and it has to at all costs.&quot;</p>

<p>That is why very soon we will see this in practice, when open nuclear warfare will set upon us. Does this HAVE to happen? NO! You have to get out of your house and talk to anyone that will listen. And don&#39;t tell them pure doom and gloom shit, just tell them how fragile this is.</p>

<p>We are the product of 4.5 billion years of evolution, our DNA has arisen and propagated itself right up to this point. The sun will die and take Earth with it in another 4 billion years, and any humans that are still around then will certainly not be anything like us.4</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oY59wZdCDo0">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oY59wZdCDo0</a></p>

<p>The new meme we have to create should go something like this &quot;We are far to fragile to endanger ourselves with the thought of world war 3, we have to move forward and manage our lives and resources equitably. We have to abandon 2 words: Hope and Faith. Those words are temporary and transitory, it&#39;s human life that is real&quot;</p>
