    <div class="md"><p>So far the best theory is that the Sun is part of a binary star system with a brown/black dwarf that is comparatively cool and hard to see (89% of the star systems in the observable universe are at least binary in nature, and typically featuring a brown dwarf in the relationship). This dim star has its own system of planets, one of the inner being Nibiru, the home of the Anunaki which the Sumerians say created our species, and whom they worshiped as gods. Occasionally this star passes between Jupiter and Mars, causing the planets in our system to shift their orbits (this might explain the Mayan calendar ending at the end of 2012), and pulling their poles out of alignment with the Sun&#39;s. In addition to the effects of the brown dwarf, which the ancients claim ignites into a full-on blue-phase star as it passes; its outer planet (&quot;The Destroyer, Nemesis, Leviathon, Red Sky Dragon&quot;) swings through the inner solar system under great duress from the planets and the dueling stars, it&#39;s crust cracking apart as it does so, causing it to become an enormous flaming comet which showers the planets with magma and hot gas as they pass through its fiery tail. Sumerian texts suggest this planet is used as a weapon by the Anunaki, though they aren&#39;t specific about how this is accomplished, or against whom it is wielded if anyone in particular; wicked and degenerate humanity perhaps, as it certainly has a devastating effect that amounts to a total reboot of civilization.</p>

<p>According to the late Zecheria Sitchin&#39;s interpretation of the Sumerian tablets which record the event, it happens every 3600 years, and is due to happen again in about 400 years. But Sitchin&#39;s interpretation is being questioned by many who cite the complexity of the Sumerian counting system and that the length of the year has changed since Sumerian times (the brown dwarf shifted the earth&#39;s orbit and added 5 days to the year), as well as all the prophecies from ancient cultures around the world pointing to catastrophic events in 2012 which include all the features of a brown dwarf fly-by, not the least of which is the abrupt ending of the 14 billion year Mayan calendar and also the similarly ancient Chinese I-ching.</p>

<p>One fascinating theory is that Sitchin did indeed interpret the Sumerian counting incorrectly (I have seen the math establishing this); the proper orbit of the brown dwarf actually being 2160 years, and not 3600. This would put it square on schedule for 2012, and it explains a lot more global catastrophes in history than Sitchin&#39;s theory. According to the adherents of this theory, the brown dwarf only passes inside of Jupiter every other time, and when it passes outside of Jupiter it&#39;s effects on the solar system are rather mild, though it still briefly ignites. One interesting correlation is that Christlike figures throughout history have invariably been born the same year as the passing of this star when the interval is counted this way.</p>

<p>The conspiracy stems from the NASA announcement in 1983 that a very large-but-dim infrared body had been discovered in the outer solar system, hailing it as the tenth planet. Despite all the fanfare, NASA suddenly recanted, saying they were mistaken and it was nothing after all. But NASA did hurriedly, and at great expense, build an infrared telescope at the South Pole immediately afterward; unlike other NASA astronomical installations, most of the data from this telescope has remained classified as top secret. The Sumerians did say that the dwarf star comes from the south (33 degrees off the ecliptic actually), and that may be why they didn&#39;t see it until late in the game themselves. As the wealthy and government officials vigorously build bunkers deep underground for themselves (google Denver International Airport conspiracy), and concentration camps for the rest of us, more and more people are questioning whether the authorities are hiding knowledge of the approach of our Sun&#39;s dim companion from the general public. One telling event is the absolute hammering of money and influence the Vatican recently levered against a reluctant state of Arizona to permit the building of a sophisticated telescope in a scenic place where no sane astronomer would put one. It also happens to be smack in the best place, according to the Hopi prophecy, to see &quot;the dance if the blue and red kachinas&quot; which heralds the end of the 5th world.</p>

<p>TMI? Damn straight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s visible in people who experience &quot;ADD&quot; or &quot;ADHD&quot;. Those two terms were invented by Big Pharma to make dumb scared parents think their kids have a problem and consequently require medication, of which the pharmaceutical industry can provide solutions to (for a price, go figure).  I was actually one of these people growing up, and it was very apparent to me that this was clearly the case. To sedate such intensely creative minds is to effectively erase any threats to the current paradigm.</p>

<p>Hyperreality is a not-too-distant reality where all human beings maximize their productivity into the greatest expression of their own existence. When people do &quot;too many things at once&quot; they are actively participating in this reality, but they are not matured yet, as none of us truly are. When we enter hyperreality, mankind will spread infinite perfection throughout the entire universe. That is our destiny, and it will only be possible with our next stage of evolution. </p>

<p>We already possess the capability to be, but our expression of it is extremely lacking (obviously). Humans are the only species aware of what <strong>G</strong>enerates it, <strong>O</strong>perates it, and <strong>D</strong>estroys it.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>13,880 B.C. and tailing off 13,785 B.C., closely corresponds to the date encoded in zodiac star lore marking the arrival of a galactic superwave. Verification (2004): Glaciologists find that the concentrations of iridium and platinum in submicron sized “meteoritic smoke? particles present in polar ice are two to three times higher during the last ice age. Verification (2007): A group of scientists, the Younger Dryas Boundary (YDB) group, reports high levels of extraterrestrial indicators (Ir, Ni, cosmic spherules, microtektites, 3He, fullerenes at the 12,950 yrs b2k Alleröd/Younger Dryas boundary layer that overlies extinct megafauna and Clovis artifacts. Verification (2008): LaViolette locates the legendary solar conflagration event in Summit, Greenland ice cores. Using correlations to the Cariaco Basin varve chronology, he dates this event at 12,885 years b2k. He finds that it is marked by a sudden increase in atmospheric radiocarbon concentration which occurs together with a climatic warming climate in Greenland changing from glacial to interglacial temperatures within less than two years. He finds that the event is also associated with an increase of ammonium, oxylate, and formate ion, which is indicative of a period of global biomass combustion. This suggests that this is the time of the conflagration that produced the Usselo Horizon. He also finds that it occurs together with an acidity ECM spike lasting less than a month as well as a rise of nitrate ion, both being indicators of a dramatic rise in the influx of solar cosmic rays.
