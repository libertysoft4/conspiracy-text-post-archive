This comet is interesting because last time it was aligned with us and the sun, the Japanese earthquake happened.  Time before that?  The earthquake in New Zealand happened.  Correlation is not causation, but this paper from Cornell University&#39;s Library finds an implied predictability of 90% over the last 50 years with other celestial alignments.</p>

<p>Does anyone else think it&#39;s interesting that this whole &quot;Rapture&quot; that started on May 31st is slated to end in utter destruction right around the time Elenin is supposed to align again?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If a passing comet (or whatever you believe Elenin to be) causes earthquakes, why the hell isn&#39;t the moon tearing the planet apart?</p>

<p>The moon&#39;s diameter is 25% of Earth&#39;s. Its gravitational pull on the Earth moves oceans without tremors. But somehow a pea-sized rock passing by 34 million miles away will cause massive earthquakes and end the world?</p>

<p>Seriously.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>[<em>sigh</em>] It&#39;s physics, people. The comet is still a long way away from the Earth. Being &quot;aligned with us and the sun&quot; has no descernable physical effect. It is astrology, not astronomy. The gravitational force exerted by a comet on our planet is so tiny as to be not even worth mentioning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that&#39;s the implication those who are tracking this object are trying to make - that it&#39;s <em>not</em> a comet.  It&#39;s always so interesting to me that those things which seem too coincidental to be dismissed are always dismissed by debunkers as being nothing but a coincident.  As I said, correlation is not causation...But correlation is CORRELATION, so it would be wise to at least be cognizant of past history as it approaches and aligns yet another time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something that dense and that small for it to have a gravitational effect is not very realistic.</p>

<p>Yes, indeed the comet was &quot;aligned&quot; on Mar 11, 2011 BUT as was Mars and Mercury. I doubt this comet had anything to do with the earthquake(s).</p>

<p>@OP, You say Elenin was aligned with us and Mars on Mar 11, 2001. This is false, see the link below.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People call it Elenin, but what if Elenin is the PSY OP for something worse? </p>

<p>Look at all the shit being flung at you right now, DSK finds out there&#39;s no gold in Fort Knox - SEX SCANDAL. He&#39;s fucking rich, why would he want to bang some cheap ass, poor woman (in comparison to WHOM he could bed).</p>

<p>Julian Assange has something so powerful he&#39;s DETAINED for weeks, SEX SCANDAL.</p>

<p>This new Weiner guy - SEX SCANDAL.</p>

<p>PSY OP to hide the truth.</p>

<p>What if Elenin is a Brown Dwarf? Undetectable? WISE, SETI, shut down. Most of the shit we have [technologically] to see it, has been SHUT THE FUCK DOWN. What timing, huh?</p>

<p>It&#39;s coming from behind the sun, it wouldn&#39;t take a genius to realise we wouldn&#39;t see it if we can only see it in infra-red, and if we can only see it in infra-red, our petty little amateur astronomers wouldn&#39;t pick it up because of the intense brightness of the thing it&#39;s next to - our fucking SUN.</p>

<p>Now, people think astronomers would tell us - yeah, because Scientists aren&#39;t Government-funded, and tell us Global Warming is human-caused. HAHAHA biggest joke, but again, people BUY IT and BELIEVE IT.</p>

<p>If something were coming, do you truly think we&#39;d know?</p>

<p>Look at everything that&#39;s happening... the US can&#39;t pay their debt - what the FUCK do you truly think is going to happen? They can&#39;t continue like this... once they fall, China falls, once China falls most of the world falls.</p>

<p>It won&#39;t be the same world we&#39;ve experienced for the past 50+ years, the Elite have well and truly fucked EVERYONE over and we&#39;ve all taken it because we trust in HIGHER power (law enforcement, look at Reddit shit posted lately, the Government, scientists, fucking BREAST milk from COWS from genetically modified tech).</p>

<p>And this &quot;Elenin&quot; is coming smack bang in the middle of a time when shit is REALLY going to hit the fan.... US government won&#39;t get their debt extended, Pakistan is about to go to war, the US is truly fucked, China is not happy... </p>

<p>What gets me is people just dismiss shit because they can&#39;t see it, or can&#39;t read it on fucking news.com or something. When was the last time any life-changing event was talked about beforehand? </p>

<p>Do you think if TPTB truly had knowledge of this, they&#39;d tell the news stations? Cause mass panic? Why would you continue going to work if this &quot;thing&quot; was coming toward us and will possibly (if it&#39;s a Brown Dwarf or Black Hole or something WE JUST DONT KNOW/DON&#39;T HAVE THE SCIENCE FOR) comes between us and the Sun and pushes us OUT of orbit.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t need to hit us.
It doesn&#39;t need to effect us.</p>

<p>It just needs to have a strong magnetic pull, and we stop orbiting the Sun and for 2 - 3 weeks we Orbit &quot;Elenin&quot;, which then slowly pulls us away from the Sun and sling shot around it and away... by that time, we&#39;re away from the Sun and start coming back. Yet our orbit is changed..........</p>

<p>We would then start floating away from the Sun and have a much longer orbit, causing a new Ice Age to engulf the Earth within 6 - 12 months. There would be much longer nights than days and it would get MUCH FUCKING COLDER as we float away from our Star.</p>

<p>Just think about it... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was the Russians that busted the news about Elenin though, and Russia is not NWO. NASA is actually rather taciturn about it (I grant you that may be part of the op). My reckoning is that the banksters and their cronies have looted the planet and created unsolvable problems for themselves like there was no tomorrow because there is no tomorrow; they fully expect to jump down down their condo-bunkers while the <em>useless eaters</em> burn and drown along with all the knotty problems they caused.</p>

<p>But in my opinion the thing(s) we call Comet Elenin is not the destroyer, though it may get a few licks in somehow (I&#39;m thinking electrical discharges as it passes) but the harbinger of it; the blue kachina that dances before the red one which will purify the earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Russia is always involved in everything the US do... </p>

<p>It also is fishy how some random Russian guy finds it... yet the almighty technology of the US can&#39;t. So either the US are scared of something and they&#39;re PSY OP-ing the shit out of it (NASA saying we&#39;ll see a &quot;bright object&quot; in the sky toward Sept, etc), WISE, SETI, etc all shutting down, the mysterious shit going on in Antarctica, etc.</p>

<p>There&#39;s SOMETHING happening, what it is - we don&#39;t know. </p>

<p>What fucks me off MORE is people are far more willing to put their ENTIRE belief system into Religion, something that cannot be proven and is pure fucking BLIND FAITH, yet something scientific, actually able to be proven or shown (if TPTB weren&#39;t hiding it) is not even considered a reality.</p>

<p>Until it happens people will be blind and if shit really starts hitting the fan the people will only turn to the Government and wonder why.</p>

<p>But, the Government won&#39;t be there or contactable, because if this object is fucking with the Sun and causes a massive CME/something unexpected and knocks out half the Sun-facing satellites, there&#39;ll be no communication, Internet would be very half/half, etc.</p>

<p>What the hell would you do if the Earth started rumbling one day and didn&#39;t stop? Yet no phone calls, electricity, TV, internet... or the Earth does indeed do what I said it would and starts floating away from the Sun and they blame out coolness and eventual Ice Age on Global Warming........ and ride it out until the Satellites go out of working order when &quot;Elenin&quot; comes close?</p>

<p>Also, according to <a href="http://www.calleman.com/content/ninthwaveintro.pdf">Carl Calleman</a> the end of the Mayan calendar is not in 2012, but October 28th of this year. About the same time as Elenin makes a very close pass to Earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed.  Currently I&#39;m of the camp that it is simply a bringing of a &quot;new age.&quot;  Will there be catastrophes and a lot of hardship?

    <div class="md"><p>Most people are coming around to it being the end of <em>our world,</em> but merely a purification for the planet, and life-in-general (the movie 2012 is a good example). There is a reason John the revelator named the offending object &quot;Wormwood,&quot; after an anti-parasitic purgative drug. For us it means great catastrophes, and generous amounts of fire and water are indeed present in the Mayan prophecies alongside the 9 descending gods, and this is the case with all the other eschatalogical prophecies around the world as well. The gist of the New Age and Modern Mayan feel-good routine, is that if you embrace the spiritual ascension of love and hope, it doesn&#39;t matter whether you survive the cataclysms or not (the difference between death and a truncated, horrible life in ruined world) because what matters is that you are reborn into the golden age; so just don&#39;t think about that part of it, and pretend like it&#39;s only ascension. Perhaps it&#39;s not coincidental that this is exactly the sort of drug NWO needs to manage the doomed masses as entropy increases.</p>

<p>NASA has observed a wobble which confirms it is composed of more than one object, and it should perhaps be called a cometary cluster at this point, rather than a single body. Its reflectivity is quite a bit lower than comets generally, suggesting materials more dense than ice, and there is speculation among Russian scientists that alien technology is somehow involved; Dr. Elenin&#39;s photo does seem to support that hypothesis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually asked Neil deGrasse Tyson about this when I had the chance a little more than a month ago.</p>

<p>Now I know you guys may consider him one of &quot;them&quot;; but it&#39;s hard to argue the physics.</p>

<p>At those distances, the comet would have to be absurdly enormous to have any measurable gravitational effect on the earth. He equated it to a mosquito&#39;s gravitational pull affecting that of an elephant&#39;s.</p>

<p>If alignments in our solar system caused earthquakes, why don&#39;t we have a major earthquake everytime we &quot;align&quot; with jupiter,saturn,neptune etc. All of which are larger objects that are much closer to us.</p>

<li>Alignments are nothing.  Lining something up so they form a line in your mind doesn&#39;t actually do anything.</li>
<li>The Planet X crap is about the stupidest conspiracy stuff Ive seen. Most people who promote it lack even a primary school level science education.</li>
<li>New Zealand and Japan have hundreds of earthquakes every day, as do most places on the pacific rim.  It has nothing to do with a comet.</li>
<li>Planet X nuts are predictably starting to scramble for anything to match their flawed belief system. Once 2013 hits we shall see all the same signs as the other doomsday nuts, oh we got the date wrong, oh we translated this new age bullshit text wrong, buy my book for the real date... etc etc etc.</li>
