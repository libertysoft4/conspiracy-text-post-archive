<p>I am about to make this terrible decision in life. The right thing to do is obvious but I&#39;m not going to do it!</p>

<p>Or alternately, my friend is about to make this terrible decision in life, how can I stop them!</p>

<p>And so ensues a bevy of good hearted people offering predictable advice. I&#39;m starting to think that we&#39;ve been had and these aren&#39;t just trolls but part of Reddit&#39;s business model. They make sure enough posts make the front page that pull emotional chords to trigger a response. I&#39;m not buying it anymore. The frequency of these manipulative posts is too steady and predictable to be real. Surely there must be boring reddit news days too, but instead there&#39;s always a steady stream of teenage level drama. I&#39;m calling BS on our friends at Reddit and think they&#39;re playing with our minds to ensure their continued success.</p>

<p>Completely disagree, I&#39;ll point out whatever I want.  I think it&#39;s good for people to realise that they&#39;re not the only ones fed-up with the bullshit submissions.  People who post batshit insane theories need to be told to shut the fuck up and I&#39;m often happy to oblige.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting. I don&#39;t subscribe to r/conspiracy, but the r/relationships, r/suicide, and r/depression seem to have a number of posts that can&#39;t possibly be true. And it&#39;s not like you can call BS on them because what if someone&#39;s really hurting. If you&#39;re seeing similar things in r/conspiracy then perhaps we&#39;ve found a trend...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The big &quot;emotional&quot; and &quot;outrageous story&quot; posts that gets lots of attention only happen in the big subreddits like Ask Reddit or IAMA or Pics.  Suicide Watch and Depression posts only generate a handful of responses, and most of them are of the quick &quot;<em>PM me if you want to talk</em>&quot; variety.  The &quot;<em>OMG Where can I send money?</em>&quot; responses that grab lots of attention occur much more frequently in the big subreddits.  If Reddit employees are trolling behind the scenes to generate buzz, then it makes more sense to devote their resources to the most popular subreddits and not Suicide Watch or Depression, which are smaller and less influential in comparison.</p>

<p>I also just don&#39;t see what&#39;s so hard to believe about the majority posts in Suicide Watch and Depression.  I&#39;ve never thought anything was particularly trollish in either of those subreddits, and I&#39;m usually among the first to call BS on just about anything in IAMA or Ask Reddit.</p>

<p>i know that digg&#39;s userbase was made up of people with somewhat dissimilar interests to the userbase of reddit and i can see the influence of those people on reddit. am i saying that <em>every</em> digger was an immature douche? no, obviously that kind of generalization would be false and there&#39;s really no need to be so defensive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is all anecdotal from my experiences with these websites. i was a digger for a couple years prior to migrating here so i&#39;m just going on what i observed. i think digg was much more easily accessible to a younger audience than reddit was. digg was more well-known.</p>

<p>reddit changed after the whole digg fiasco, whether it was caused by the influx of users straight from digg or the randoms reading about it on the tech blogs. not to mention all the Anons who were undecided about which site to post their recycled 4chan material on suddenly had that decision made for them. is it better or worse? who&#39;s to say really? but it is undeniably different imo.</p>

<p>ninja edit: i guess you think i&#39;m bitching about the state of reddit but i am still here and i still enjoy it, fwiw. also to quote just put &gt; in front (no space!) of what you want to quote on a new line like </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never dismiss a post as being fake. If something strike a cord with me I follow it until I find logical fault with it. Why use an online medium like a forum if I&#39;m just going to dismiss everything I read as a hoax or a bot? I might be missing out on a chance to find out something interesting or new. IMHO it&#39;s worth the risk of being fooled. It&#39;s the Internet. Play at your own risk :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are some posts fake? Yes, but the growing majority, I don&#39;t think so... not even close.  you&#39;ve got to admit it&#39;s somewhat pessimistic/cynical to think that of all the people on reddit, that a &quot;majority&quot; of people submitting new posts are fake.  </p>

<p>Do these sensationalist bullshit submissions happen, totally, but it certainly doesn&#39;t mean that they&#39;re all fake.  Beyond that, it&#39;s totally unprovable that it&#39;s even a &quot;growing&quot; number, and if you really wanna debate it, you&#39;d be better off spending some time over at <a href="/r/circlejerk">/r/circlejerk</a>.  </p>

<p>All I can say is that most everything that I&#39;ve noticed in life goes in some sort of cycle of up and down like a sine wave, and if you believe that more of these new submissions are fake, then perhaps we&#39;re just in a higher part of the fake submissions wave.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was here when Reddit was a bit smaller.  The comments would be so retarded like
&quot;Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah  &quot;
and then the next person would be like
&quot;Zip-A-Dee-A&quot;
and then of course the next
&quot;My oh my what a wonderful day&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a certain type of person who is suspicious of everything and you, my friend, are almost certainly of that type. That&#39;s why you hang out in a place like this.</p>

<p>People of your type can never be dissuaded from this view because anyone attempting to do so is obviously part of a conspiracy.</p>

<p>The truth is in the real world there are fake stories and there are real stories and I suspect Reddit reflects that by having both kinds.</p>

<p>Incidentally, I&#39;m not subscribed to r/conspiracy. I just submitted to it since my proposition was based on a hunch and wouldn&#39;t survive the scrutiny of other sub reddits.</p>
