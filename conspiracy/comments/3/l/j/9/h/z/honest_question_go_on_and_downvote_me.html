    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t hate Jews.  I just don&#39;t trust or share views with anyone in the entire world who requires a condition of someone else suffering as part of their acceptable conditions for success.  Built into the very works of Jewish Monetary Philosophy in Socio-Religious contexts are premises that some are chosen to be wealthy, and others must be deliberately impoverished.</p>

<p>This is a side edict to Tikkun, or &quot;good will&quot; which is the opportunity for philanthropy as a way to excuse the immoral practices necessary to gain disproportionate wealth.  Masoretic Judiasm carries and promotes a strong heritage that God makes his chosen wealthy, by their own deception and ambition.</p>

<p>I do not hold this against ALL Jewish persons, or ONLY Jewish persons.  In fact, there are some Jews who purge such mess from their religion, recognizing it as a ROMAN influenced redaction.  Then again, this does not indicate by any means I take issue with every Italian, just some of their tenets that aide, abet, and generate an atmosphere of corporate and governmental deception as a means of success for a specific designation of people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your question is based on a false premise. This sub (I presume you mean the subscribers to this sub) don&#39;t hate Jews. The reason you <em>think</em> they hate Jews is because Jews are criticized as a group here. There are not many other places where Jews are criticized for their crimes. The freedom to criticize the actions of Jews is perceived by you as hatred, because you&#39;ve been brainwashed all  your life, by Jews, that you must never question or criticize Jews.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you sure are going through a lot of trouble to justify discriminating against Jews, and to harass me about it in particular. I&#39;m getting less and less interested in talking to you by the minute, due to this erratic and senseless behavior. Just a heads up.</p>

<p>All Jews view their religion differently, just like all Americans view their nation differently. Most Jews just consider themselves Jews because they were born into Jewish families, or because they have Jewish heritage, and don&#39;t actually practice Judaism as a religion. I know some rabbinical sources encourage the acquisition of wealth, but you also won&#39;t even be able to find a Jew on the street who knows these rabbinical sources, I guarantee it. Not to mention the acquisition of wealth isn&#39;t even evil in itself, just like I said earlier.</p>

<p>There is, and it&#39;s called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talmud">the Talmud</a>, a series of books which have collectively been described as an &quot;instruction manual for Judaism&quot;. </p>

<p>Although there is much ancient wisdom in the Talmud, there is also much therein to offend <strong>anybody</strong> who is not Jewish. It is a race hate bible which declares that only Jews are human, and describes the goyim (non-Jews) as beasts. It encourages and/or permits Talmud-adherents to cheat, lie, steal, rape and murder non-Jews, declaring such actions to be &quot;non-criminal&quot;. </p>

The Hebrew Scriptures are full of many instructions for those with wealth to share with others in need, and not to lend with interest, and stuff like that. They&#39;re common themes and they&#39;re reiterated many times. So it doesn&#39;t really make any sense to say the religion itself is the problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, it is.</p>

<p>See the story of Cain, a murderer, who is given a NATION and diplomatic immunity from heaven.</p>

<p>See the story of Abram who discards the surrogate mother that Rachel consented to allow to bear him a child.  Then see how he almost tricked the king if Canaan to commit adultery (which would have left him IN DEBT OF SLAVERY to Abram)</p>

<p>See the story of Jacob, who tricks his father into giving his birthright to the wrong son, and this is GOD&#39;s PLAN?</p>

<p>See the story of Solomon, risen to a godly throne by a sanctioned assassination in secret, plotted by their highest leaders of religion and politics.</p>

<p>See the story of Cyrus,..  </p>

<p>When does the world look at how what the biblical god does is by the same standard of judgement that which we are indoctrinated to fear; how the corrupt keep their iron fist in a silk glove upon the yokes around all our necks?  In Isaiah, he even says to Cyrus,  everything you do good, is all good.  Screw Good and Evil, cause I made them both.  He encourages Cyrus in Persia to do EXACTLY what the current conspiracy are all based around...   Confuse, Conspire, and Confound, and Conquer.</p>

<p>Even if it is not just Jews, or all Jews, the inspiration is EXACTLY this story, the chaos created that the order of the second temple arises out of.  How the prosperity and poverty of nations were both cards in the same deck to fuel secret HOLY SANCTIONED world building events... that people were distracted from either by the emergent need of their own survival, or the distractions of their own greed.  And ANY attempt at truth by any but the chosen was met with financed and endorsed rumor.  Even plotting to cause sin foreign nations to cause them to totally lose sight of common sense and human decency...  moral decay.</p>

<p>I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these things. (Isaiah 45:7)</p>

<p>The danger of the story of Cyrus is that from it emerges that as the chosen people are God&#39;s chosen, they do what god tells them to, and it is good...  even if it would be evil for anyone else.   The old testament ESPECIALLY instructs the world to live in a double standard existence where the excuse for any action for a Jew is &quot;God Approves&quot;, or as it is now written on the US Dollar &quot;Annuit Coeptis.&quot;</p>

<p>The only consequence of a Jew, by Old Testamen edict is the punisment of God HIMSELF, and to this end he can conceal any and EVERY atrocity -  but the Midrash says he should not endeavor to abuse TOO MUCH this privilege.  Though if he does, he is fulfilling prophecy which says this is what makes necessary a messiah,  the abuse of some Jews of their UNIVERSAL PRIVILEGE FROM EXCLUSIVE AND HOLY PREFERENCE.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>like I said, what you&#39;re saying is completely illogical. Yes, bad things are done with the aid of money. However, the acquisition of money has no actual relationship to those things. It&#39;s completely possible to acquire money and not use it to do evil things. Money doesn&#39;t cause those things to happen in any way, they happen because evil people cause them to happen. The issue isn&#39;t &quot;the concentration of money&quot; - it&#39;s evil people, who just happen to be using money.</p>

<p>I do believe the 9/11 attacks were staged, yes. I believe in plenty of conspiracies and believe most authorities and most powerful figures to be corrupt. I just don&#39;t believe in the nonsense you&#39;re posting, because it&#39;s illogical and it doesn&#39;t make any sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Money and power are synonymous. Money literally buys power. A great example of this is Ross Perot in his presidential bid-- he did it all with the concentration of wealth. Money can, and has, flawed countless scientific studies. Corrupted hundreds of millions of people. <strong>It is the single most powerful, tangible resource on the planet.</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.thesimpledollar.com/money-and-power/">&quot;The real reason people want to be rich isn’t so they can buy stuff. It’s so they can have power over others. People want influence and respect and they see that people with money have influence and respect, so they seek money.&quot;</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.123helpme.com/view.asp?id=82072">&quot; One of the most obvious examples is politics. Ross Perot was an unkown
multimillionaire and his money is the only reason that he made it into the
presidential election. If a man who earned a standard salary wanted to run for
president, he would have almost no chance at all unless he was backed by people
with money.&quot;</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-does-money-have-so-much-power">&quot;Money has power because the accumulation of money (wealth) gives you claim cheques, that allow you to allocate this wealth to any mode of consumption or project you deem worthy. It also influences other people to do things for you, as can be seen by the rampant political corruption in so many political systems&quot;</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your account has JIDF written all over it. You defend Judaism as if it were your job.</p>

<p>Your comment history:</p>

<p>&quot;I honestly think we should start taking a hard stance against all this anti-Jew bullshit. Just get a mod who is able to discern thoughtful anti-Zionism and anti-Israel material from the completely unreasoned anti-Jew material and ban every single post and every single user that fails to make the distinction and goes off on some Jew talk. &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have no affiliation with Jews and no vested interest in Jews whatsoever. I argue in favor of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. I argue in favor of sensible discussion and against idiocy. Fuck the Jews. I don&#39;t even care about Jews.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My point being that regardless of any Jewish predominance in this or that field, the only sensible approach is to view Jews from this same exact perspective as we view Americans.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I was talking to someone who accused me of being JIDF.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They all work together toward the same ends with the same ideologies! But you have to go ahead and say, herp derp, they&#39;re Jews! Must be something pretty dastardly about the Jews!</p>

<p>Seriously, are you a complete fucking idiot? You might as well just blame the heterosexuals for 9/11.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So ok. In a hypothetical situation, when five Mossad agents are picked up near the WTC, and when the Israeli national government directly commissioned the 9/11 attacks, even still, why does this have anything to do with Jews? Why isn&#39;t it just Mossad, or just the Israeli government? It has to be &quot;Jews&quot; ? Absurdly simplistic finger pointing like this is the reason nobody respects conspiracy theorists or this subreddit.&quot; <strong>Good, gtfo.</strong></p>

<p>&quot;So you&#39;re telling me you actually believe that Jews are naturally a thieving and manipulative race? Because if so, you&#39;re an imbecile, and you have no place in a reasoned discussion between adults.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Actually, they&#39;re hidden behind layers and layers of fall guys who each have very little understanding of what they&#39;re doing. Either way, though, none of that excuses the foolish talk of &quot;jew masters,&quot; as though an entire ethnicity is secretly pulling strings in the world. That just makes us look like idiots.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nobody&#39;s denying anything. But if anyone is going to take <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> seriously, ever, we could really do without simple-minded accusations like &quot;Jews are very cunning.&quot; &quot;(Jews) know how to get things done.&quot; &quot;(Jews) have mastered the art of lying, cheating, stealing, and deception to get what they want&quot;</p>

<p>These statements have nothing to do with Zionism and everything to do with racism.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Shut the fuck up with your Jews bullshit.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I guess it must be my mistake then, seeing how two hours before this thread you posted another one with the title &quot;So Why Did The World Let The Jews Get Away With 9/11?&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why would we name the planet Jupiter when there aren&#39;t even any Jews on it?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never claimed I believe the white race deserves to die out, that&#39;s a pretty serious thing to accuse me of believing when I never said anything even similar. You&#39;re the only one worried about the white race dying out. I already told you: I don&#39;t care about race at all.</p>

<p>in a hypothetical situation where whites are outbred by other races, or where all ethnicities are completely mixed and the world becomes one race, the same attributes that have allowed whites to make their technological advancements would continue to exist, even if whites no longer existed. This is because there is no relationship between those technological advancements and the ethnicity of white people - no relationship at all. Those white people just happened to be in the right place at the right time, and that&#39;s the reason those technological advancements occurred - not because of their ethnicity. So there&#39;s really nothing to worry about.</p>

<p>If you had an accurate understanding like I do, you wouldn&#39;t need to worry yourself about such silly things, like the Jews, or like protecting the fate of white people, or whatever other nonsense you worry about. Those topics and those viewpoints are only for confused people who lack understanding. It is impossible for a sensible person or a mature person to take them seriously.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are asking the wrong question. The correct question should be:</p>

<p>Why are Jews involved in so much wrongdoing, exploitation, war crimes, abuse and general injustice against fellow man, that you&#39;d have hell of a hard time finding a misdeed that Jews don&#39;t have their hand in?</p>

<p>If you tend to see many posts about Jews, it&#39;s not because people hate Jews, but because Jews do evil things incomparably more often than anyone else. If they stopped doing it, pure magic would happen - the posts about them would decrease significantly.</p>

<p>Why does this sub hate Jews so much? </p>

<p>HOW much does THIS SUB <em>hate</em> Jews?</p>

<p>What do you even mean, &quot;Jews&quot;? The &quot;race&quot;, or tribe? The culture? The religion? The nation-state some Jews, or Jewish people, (re-)founded for themselves to be safe from another Shoah? The nice watch-maker around the corner named Kohn without any ties to Judaism at all or the venom-spitting atheist Zionist trumpeting his superiority over the goyim? </p>

<p>HOW much does THIS SUB <em>hate</em> Catholics if there&#39;s an occasional post about Jesuit conspiracies, strange rituals and occult symbology? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Either the racists lost every other sub they once hung out in or else they are here solely for the purpose to ruin this sub and discredit the conspiracy theory community… However, &quot;this sub&quot; does not hate any race. Hate and racism has nothing to do with why we are here. My question is, why are the racists here now? The moderators need to ban every account promoting racist views, like NOW before this sub sinks entirely… which is probably the point of why they are allowed to be here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s no reason acquiring wealth should be considered a sin, there&#39;s really nothing wrong with it as far as I can tell. If you acquire wealth and you don&#39;t share with others in need, though, or if you use the wealth immorally, I think that&#39;s definitely wrong and should be identified as wrong. The Hebrew Scriptures are full of many instructions for those with wealth to share with others in need, and not to lend with interest, and stuff like that. They&#39;re common themes and they&#39;re reiterated many times. So it doesn&#39;t really make any sense to say the religion itself is the problem.</p>
