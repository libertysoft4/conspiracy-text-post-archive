    <div class="md"><p>ok, i like a good conspiracy as much as the next guy...some would even say i&#39;m one of those crazy tin foil hat guys...</p>

<p>but i will not believe that someone willingly built a nuclear device under the sears tower, and that no one has discovered it. the fact that this rumor has come this far that two dudes on reddit are randomly discussing it means SOMEONE would have gotten word and mayyyybe checked on it by now.</p>

<p>i&#39;m gonna file that one under &#39;unlikely&#39;. but thanks for elaborating on that for me! appreciate it!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People who understand the 9/11 predictive programming scheme are seeing the same thread with 9/23. There are countless videos on the amount of 9/23 symbolism placed in movies and media that rivals (even surpasses) what was done for 9/11.</p>

<p>What we have now are the same type of &quot;warnings&quot; from the Hollywood media cabal that preceded 9/11.</p>

<p>Just a reminder, that the usage of propaganda in the US was legalized under the NDAA. So, it wouldn&#39;t be surprising if a &quot;legal&quot; FF was conducted by the same group of zog playwrights.</p>

<p>EDIT: People who don&#39;t understand <em>why</em> predictive programming is important should understand this. If you were <em>not</em> exposed to fictional images of &quot;rag-head&quot; terrorists attacking Americans or American buildings leading-up to 9/11, you&#39;d be less-inclined to believe the &quot;official&quot; story when it&#39;s delivered to you. Without predictive programming before 911, people would say, &quot;Wait a second.. what just happened there?.. Hold on a minute, this is just an isolated event, no need to attack another country yet. This is out of the blue, etc, etc&quot;.</p>

<p>However, if you have been previously exposed to a stream of images and media that vilifies a certain entity over and over, portraying them attacking Americans, there&#39;s a much better chance you will accept the &quot;official&quot; narrative once the &quot;real event&quot; takes place, and will be more inclined to demand immediate action (such as Patriot Act acceptance and a permanent &quot;war on terror&quot;). PP is absolutely critical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is another possible reason for this sort of behavior. Rather than predictive programming, the ominous insertions could be for people like us and people that work with those that commit such crimes. This would also be the same reason why they flash their symbolism on the media. It&#39;s about control through fear. This is seen through self awareness. &quot;<em>Why do I do what I do?</em>&quot; thinking. </p>

<p>How does it make us aware people feel when <em>we</em> see this information? Afraid? Of what? The power of the cabal? Wouldn&#39;t that also affect the minions, willing or otherwise, as <em>they</em> see the information too? Doesn&#39;t this manifest fear of the power of the cabal affect how we might act to resist the cabal, as observers like us, or as those that could release some damaging information? It&#39;s to keep us in our places so they can keep pulling the levers of power. The message is basically, &quot;<em>look at our power over the things that greatly affect your life. You don&#39;t have a chance. Give up and submit.</em>&quot;</p>

<p>This does not mean predictive programming is not also afoot concurrently. </p>

<p>Part of what you are talking about is rooted in the concept of <em>Revelation of Method</em>. I think ROL is inherent in whatever force is driving the bus.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are two main levels from which to perceive this concept. The first is that preconditioning is simply a method to get the subjects to accept the agendas being implemented. The other is, without our explicit or even implied agreeance, these things cannot take place.</p>

<p>While they work in concert and both beg humanity’s compliance, those dynamics are powerfully different. Both require human awareness at different levels, yet the second more esoteric notion implies a sort of restrictive code whereby without agreeance any such takeover plan apparently would not be “allowed” to succeed. <a href="http://www.zengardner.com/revelation-method-predictive-programming-prime-directive/">source</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>honestly Moo, there were a lot, it was very strange when I found out about it via youtube videos - almost too creepy, honestly - one or two could be a coincidence, but all of these (check youtube for it)?</p>

<p>for example in The Matrix from 1999 - right before 9/11 - they released it and Neo is in the government offices with the &quot;agent smiths&quot;  - the part of the movie where they magically shut him up by literally sealing his lips together so he can&#39;t speak out against them or argue with their power over him .. they show him he is powerless over the monolithic &quot;agent system&quot; - they cut to a scene showing Neo&#39;s &quot;official documents&quot;, including a passport of his - his passport says &quot;MAJOR CITY USA&quot;, &quot;11 SEP / SEPTEMBER 01&quot;.. </p>

<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_lUu92QY0YZo/S8pRtXZqPwI/AAAAAAAAA24/YPT0YNVIoL4/s1600/matrix+passport.JPG">http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_lUu92QY0YZo/S8pRtXZqPwI/AAAAAAAAA24/YPT0YNVIoL4/s1600/matrix+passport.JPG</a></p>

<p>there are many more - that&#39;s just one incident. Google it, &quot;neo&#39;s passport 9/11&quot;. Then there is the X-Files Spinoff series that was titled &quot;The Lone Gunman&quot; I think, that only had one or two episodes released before being pulled by the network (or maybe they only needed to put one out to get their message out? =/ who knows how this stuff <em>really</em> operates behind those fucking cabal scenes) -- and in it, they literally had a plot-line about criminal break-away portions of the government doing <em>exactly what happened on 9/11</em> and basically showing what the conspiracy theorists have come to believe - prior to the event even happening.</p>

<p>Like, what the fuck? Here are some more small incidental parts in major shows that just make no sense: <a href="https://johnkimber.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/simpsons-9-11-1997-m11-622131.jpg?w=640&amp;amp;h=426">https://johnkimber.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/simpsons-9-11-1997-m11-622131.jpg?w=640&amp;amp;h=426</a></p>

<p>Either this is all a natural part of the collective human subconscious magically knowing this shit will happen and putting it out there - or it&#39;s an announcement by some nutty crazy psychos or people who are part of a hidden terrorist/criminal plot against America -- which <em>you already believe in</em> even if you believe the story we are all told -- the only difference is <em>who is behind it</em> and what level of infiltration have they achieved against us all. It seems to me they have achieved an extreme level of it, a harmful, scary, bad level where they can hurt everyone..and they do.. they have.. they have literally used America to kill millions of people and get millions of us Americans hurt in more ways that I can list here.</p>

Your examples do nothing at all to predispose citizens to accept the official explanation for a putative 9/11 plot, they actually do the exact opposite.

<p>That&#39;s what &quot;moo&quot; asked for, that&#39;s what he said verbatim. You are sort of making stuff up and ignoring what I said while going all over the place and putting words into other people&#39;s mouths while failing to address the meaningful points being made.</p>

<p>you say this thing like - </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve never even seen a motive for the type of foreshadowing that you provided that didn&#39;t evoke the occult.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>as if it&#39;s a vague argument against the validity of the stuff I posted? You think some big group of people &quot;predictively programming&quot; is more likely than &quot;evoking the occult&quot;(which just means not readily understood by simpletons)?</p>

<p>speaking of &#39;the occult&#39;, have you ever heard of Hermeticism? Where we get the word &quot;hermetically sealed&quot; - allowing nothing in or out - sealed up tight like the mysteries of Hermes to the dumbasses. The Matrix is basically a mystery &quot;occult&quot; story/play like the medieval and classical mystery plays. Even his name - Neo Anderson has &quot;occult meaning&quot; - he is the perfected man, or man becoming god - the <em>new man</em>, &quot;<em>the one</em>&quot;, the man who has realized he is the one, and the all is in him/he has the power of &#39;the all&#39;(within the matrix and outside, godlike powers).</p>

<p>His name means <strong>&quot;Neo&quot;(meaning &#39;new&#39;, like &#39;neo-conservative&#39;) - &quot;Ander&quot; (from the Greek word for Man) - &quot;Son&quot; (meaning &#39;son&#39;) -  He is the &quot;New Son of Man&quot; - Neo Andrson.</strong> Then you have mind (morpheus) and heart (trinity) - or intellect / spirit - and the machines represent intellect without wisdom or spirit - it&#39;s literally FULL of symbols, language, and allegories taken from the most well-known mystery religion/occult spiritual philosophy on the planet. Neo wakes up in the world of the matrix and overcomes his lower, base imagined self to realize and regain his true place as &#39;god&#39;, or as &#39;the one&#39;, overcoming the illusion and having power over it all. He is the illumined man.</p>

<p>you have no idea how deep this shit goes, apparently, and you seem to be thinking in very shallow terms as if there&#39;s only a simple answer to everything like normal psych. warfare - and you seem to think that everything else is woo or hooey? But that is not so.</p>

<p>You&#39;re totally right, I was hasty in my reading and was thinking about the poster that moo was responding to. </p>

<p>I do think that my explanation for the apparent foreshadowing 9/11 is the more likely one. The occult motive I alluded to was more about the idea of an occult ritual that is made more effective by giving hints for it that cannot reasonably be deciphered until after the fact.  The occult you reference seems to be a uselessly diluted version of the word, more like basic symbolism and entomology that anything else.  </p>

<p>Can you give a plausible motive for why high-level actors would insert this sort of foreshadowing into the media? I don&#39;t dismiss occult motives out of hand, and am aware that elites have long had a fascination with the occult. But I do feel that the occult is frequently and lazily given as an explanation for many things conspiracy, without the backing of facts or reason that such a claim should come with. In lieu of those, cherry-picked hindsight seems a more likely explanation to me. Of course, my mind is always open to an alternative explanation, provided adequate facts and reasoning. </p>

<p>It is ironic that you say this after accusing me of putting words in people&#39;s mouths and going all over the place. and going off on a diatribe on meaning of words in the matrix, of all goddamn things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you heard of 911 predictive programming? The TV show the Lone Gunmen, not only predicts the events of 911 on the March 4, 2001 pilot episode but he accurately discusses that it will be an inside job. This is the guy who made the X-files.Down to the war games simulation details. How is this possible without prior knowledge? Not to mention Bill Cooper was in the conspiracy channels fully describing how they were about to do a false flag and blaming Muslims any minute now before September 11, 2001. NOT to mention the WWF wrestling blatantly describing demolition of the twin towers by the &quot;major powers&quot; as mass entertainment. Please Google everything I mentioned it&#39;s been covered in millions of forms,videos etc on the Internet. </p>

<p>Now, knowing this predictive programming prior knowledge thing....Now that we are paying attention we see the same thing about September 23, 2015. We have Jade Helm drills coinciding with this prediction. We have drills, specifically &quot;Shelter in Place&quot; drills for Marines and military families September 22, 2015.We have  the French foreign Minister saying &quot; 500 days&quot; before climate disaster, &quot; not a day more&quot; he mentions SEPT 23 as important. We have a peculiar ticker on the July 10, 2015 Today Show banner saying &quot; a 9.0 earth quake hits Bay area&quot; 7-10-2015 code for tishri 10(7-10) on the Hebrew calendar which is Sept 23, 2015 on our calender.hmmm...someone had to program that into the ticker.It is specific. On July 21-23, Fox and CNN were warning / predicting the &quot; Big One&quot; for California. The Fox news guy even says &quot;you should move&quot;. We have the  Pope says expects to not to live long as visited the US. Madonna release an album in December 2015, in her song Ghost town she says &quot; In one year from now, 6 US cities will be destroyed&quot;. CNN airs video of North Korean leader touching a nuke that reads 239 in bold letters. A viral marketing video called : Be ready #231134421, had a hidden message: a clock with hands reading 1:00, a ☯ ,  mem or water sign, North and South America on map, and a power/outlet plug. In the video, it warns New Yorkers to &quot;runaway&quot;. The yingyang symbol/position has been deciphered as hidden code for autumn equinox in chinese/ Asian wisdom which = September 23, 2015. Kali, the destroyer was projected onto the Empire State building in August 2015 with her third eye open, it means whatever she is looking at will be destroyed in Hindu beliefs. </p>

<p>So the predictive programing is clear: New York is in major  trouble, Pope will be assassinated as already predicted in the Third Secret of Fatima text in the &quot; Big City&quot; that has been destroyed by some disaster, he will be killed while praying for this city.The major California earthquake will hit in 2015.US government is ready down to the last drill and, even the Fed moved from New York. I pray for New York. The predictive programing pattern is telling a sad and terrible story.</p>

The World doesn&#39;t have to end but the right crisis can, is being manufactured to usher in a new way of life that may not be a great future. Many people assume Apocalypse or Revelation means &quot;doomsday&quot;.It actually means &quot;revealing or unveiling&quot; of something. Like &quot;Heliophant&quot;...in I pet Goat II. The World may not end for you or for me, but our way of life and understanding of the World we live in may end, in which some poor folks may have their world end like 911 to accomplish the sinister plans to bring their Order out of the  Chaos they manufacture.</p>

<p>The Shanghai market is down significantly as it opened 10 minutes ago. If this data is worse than expected when it comes out tonight, we could see a drop that seriously disrupts our market here in the US. Any bad news this week would send the market overboard. </p>

Think this is all true? Realize &quot;the conspiracy&quot; is real right as the state uses some terrifying incident to lock up / lock down all dissidents as &quot;potential home-grown extremists&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>YouTube, type &quot;9/11 prediction in movies.&quot; Hundreds of 9/11 &quot;too-coincidental-to-be-coincidental&quot; images, lines from characters and scenes replicating the events of 9/11 before 9/11 ever happened.</p>

<p>My personal favorite is the WWF Twin Towers scene with Hulk Hogan and Macho Man Randy Savage. </p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not to mention Bill Cooper was in the conspiracy channels fully describing how they were about to do a false flag and blaming Muslims any minute now before September 11, 2001. NOT to mention the WWF wrestling blatantly describing demolition of the twin towers by the &quot;major powers&quot; as mass entertainment. Please Google everything I mentioned it&#39;s been covered in millions of forms,videos etc on the Internet. - <a href="/u/themeanbeaver">/u/themeanbeaver</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>honestly Moo, there were a lot, it was very strange when I found out about it via youtube videos - almost too creepy, honestly - one or two could be a coincidence, but all of these (check youtube for it)?</p>

<p>for example in The Matrix from 1999 - right before 9/11 - they released it and Neo is in the government offices with the &quot;agent smiths&quot;  - the part of the movie where they magically shut him up by literally sealing his lips together so he can&#39;t speak out against them or argue with their power over him .. they show him he is powerless over the monolithic &quot;agent system&quot; - they cut to a scene showing Neo&#39;s &quot;official documents&quot;, including a passport of his - his passport says &quot;MAJOR CITY USA&quot;, &quot;11 SEP / SEPTEMBER 01&quot;.. </p>

<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_lUu92QY0YZo/S8pRtXZqPwI/AAAAAAAAA24/YPT0YNVIoL4/s1600/matrix+passport.JPG">http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_lUu92QY0YZo/S8pRtXZqPwI/AAAAAAAAA24/YPT0YNVIoL4/s1600/matrix+passport.JPG</a></p>

<p>there are many more - that&#39;s just one incident. Google it, &quot;neo&#39;s passport 9/11&quot;. Then there is the X-Files Spinoff series that was titled &quot;The Lone Gunman&quot; I think, that only had one or two episodes released before being pulled by the network (or maybe they only needed to put one out to get their message out? =/ who knows how this stuff <em>really</em> operates behind those fucking cabal scenes) -- and in it, they literally had a plot-line about criminal break-away portions of the government doing <em>exactly what happened on 9/11</em> and basically showing what the conspiracy theorists have come to believe - prior to the event even happening.</p>

<p>Like, what the fuck? Here are some more small incidental parts in major shows that just make no sense: <a href="https://johnkimber.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/simpsons-9-11-1997-m11-622131.jpg?w=640&amp;amp;h=426">https://johnkimber.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/simpsons-9-11-1997-m11-622131.jpg?w=640&amp;amp;h=426</a></p>

<p>Either this is all a natural part of the collective human subconscious magically knowing this shit will happen and putting it out there - or it&#39;s an announcement by some nutty crazy psychos or people who are part of a hidden terrorist/criminal plot against America -- which <em>you already believe in</em> even if you believe the story we are all told -- the only difference is <em>who is behind it</em> and what level of infiltration have they achieved against us all. It seems to me they have achieved an extreme level of it, a harmful, scary, bad level where they can hurt everyone..and they do.. they have.. they have literally used America to kill millions of people and get millions of us Americans hurt in more ways that I can list here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ok, i like a good conspiracy as much as the next guy...some would even say i&#39;m one of those crazy tin foil hat guys...</p>

<p>but i will not believe that someone willingly built a nuclear device under the sears tower, and that no one has discovered it. the fact that this rumor has come this far that two dudes on reddit are randomly discussing it means SOMEONE would have gotten word and mayyyybe checked on it by now.</p>

<p>i&#39;m gonna file that one under &#39;unlikely&#39;. but thanks for elaborating on that for me! appreciate it!</p>
