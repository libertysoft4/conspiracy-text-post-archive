    <div class="md"><p>Anyone in a position of power must be subservient to Rome. Doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re Jewish or Arab like Sheikh Hamad bin Thamer Al Thani who owns Al Jezeera (which broadcasts the same news as the western stations) or Asian like Park Geun-hye who is the President of South Korea and was Jesuit-trained out of Sogang University. Besides modern-day Israel, when have Jews autonomously run any Kingdom of sovereign territory? Not since the Kingdom of Judah. But the Jesuits specifically put Jews in places of power to act as scapegoats. That&#39;s why all these Jews are somehow connected with the Jesuits/Papacy usually through a Knighthood or an educational institution. Look into some of the Jewish Pontifical Knights of Saint Gregory the Great who have fostered relations between Roman Catholicism and Judaism. Also look into the ADL and how until recently it was headed by Abe Foxman who is a racial Jew but is a Roman Catholic Knight of Malta and how the ADL gives out the “The Cardinal Bea Interfaith Award” named after Jesuit Augustin Cardinal Bea. &quot;Augustin Bea was a German Jesuit, an intimate
collaborator with brother Bavarian Jesuit Robert Leiber (the confessor of Pope Pius XII),
and a trusted subordinate of Superior General Ledochowski.
Ordained a Jesuit priest in 1912 at the age of 31, Bea proved to be an invaluable warrior
during the Second Thirty Years’ War though suffering a heart attack in 1942.
Collaborating with Leiber, Bea secretly worked with Himmler’s “sole point of contact”
Nazi statistician in numbering victims of Gestapo and SS “extirpation”—“traditionalist”
Roman Catholic Dr. Richard Korherr. After Germany’s cold betrayal by Masonic Hitler and
unconditional surrender, Bea orchestrated the Pope’s Vatican Ratlines escorting top
Nazis to safety in Italy before they departed to foreign ports. The confessor of Pius XII
shortly before he died in 1958, Bea was promoted to the Masonic office of Cardinal
Secretary of State in 1959 serving Masonic Popes John XXIII and Paul VI. For Jesuit Bea
was a member of Italy’s Masonic P2 Lodge headed by SMOM Licio Gelli, the protector of
SS/SD Captain Klaus Barbie. During Vatican II, Bea was the Jesuit who led a pretended
reconciliation with the hated Jews.&quot; Jesuit General Ledochowski was revealed in David Kertzer&#39;s latest book &quot;The Pope and Mussolini&quot; to have been markedly pro-facist and antisemetic and in fact he disseminated the Protocols of Zion to American Jesuit Charles Coughlin who was the father of &quot;Hate Radio&quot; and then to Henry Ford. Within weeks, the Protocols were being used by Hitler and Himmler in their attacks on the Jews. The holocaust was caused by the Jesuits and not only did they want to kill Jews but Protestants, liberals, heretics and Orthodox Serbs the latter of which were slaughtered by the Vatican&#39;s Ustaše in Yugoslavia.</p>

<p>That said, please do not conflate all Jews with being traitorous. It is true that many are apostate Sabbatean-Frankists and some of them will be in the arms of the Papacy working in the media or government, but there are true Jews who do not condone the Israeli government or their political system which was designed to be controlled by Jesuit-aligned Sabbateans like Shimon Peres who gave legal custody of 60% of Jerusalem to the Vatican in the Oslo Accords. Barry Chamish is perhaps the most well-known Israeli whistle-blower who exposed how it was Peres who had Yitzhak Rabin assassinated. Chamish got national news coverage in Israel and subsequently his life was threatened and he moved to America. He tells the true history of the Jewish people and Israel and admits that the Vatican is in control of Israel and is behind this New World Order. Also note that the <em>very high</em> government/intelligence positions are never filled by Jews but by white Gentiles.</p>

<p>The Vatican gave Sauidi Arabia to the House of Saud and the Vatican controls Sunni Islam, having wrote the Koran before Mohammad was even born and Islam being all about Mary worship which completely aligns with Roman Catholic doctrine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it&#39;s just that the definition of theory according to merriam-webster is vague and more appropriately identifies a hypothesis. It defines theory in the way it is used colloquially; but it&#39;s a corruption of what a theory actually is, and the reason it&#39;s so is to discredit scientific theories such as the theory of evolution. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"> A theory is not the same as a hypothesis. A theory provides an explanatory framework for some observation, and from the assumptions of the explanation follows a number of possible hypotheses that can be tested in order to provide support for, or challenge, the theory.</a></p>

<p>yeah, that was kind of my point from the beginning. </p>

<p>And since you don&#39;t seem to understand, I&#39;ll explain the relevance. The word &quot;theory&quot; was intentionally corrupted from it&#39;s original meaning in order to discredit scientists and scientific theories in the same way that the word &quot;conspiracy&quot; was corrupted in order to discredit people who call out hoaxes. </p>

<p>Make sense now? </p>

<p>EDIT: People say &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; and what they think it means is &quot;incorrect idea&quot; but what the technical meaning would be is &quot; the generally accepted assertion that there is a secret plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful that is substantiated by facts and evidence&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My understanding is that the people who are running hollywood are talented people. And if they HAPPEN to be Jewish, then that doesn&#39;t mean Jews are running hollywood. The accusation of Anti-semitism come from the fact that you&#39;re saying they&#39;re in hollywood BECAUSE they&#39;re Jews.</p>

<p>Regarding the media/news channels, rich people own corporations and media is one of those corporations. Like many others in oil, diamond, defense industry etc. Obviously, they&#39;re going to use THEIR companies to benefit them.</p>

<p>I think it is true that most of the world&#39;s most powerful people are Jewish. Now, no one except from themselves say how Jewish they actually are. I was born a Muslim but i can&#39;t hate that culture/religion more. I would be pretty pissed if i was called a Moslem and sidelined because i just happened to be born in a Muslim country/household. </p>

<p>But another interesting thing you have to note is that George Soros is also Jewish and anti-Israel. IIRC, some Rothschilds were hardcore Zionists and some/few family members were against such a policy. </p>

<p>Bottom line is that they are powerful because they were persecuted and they used their intelligence to get power. Other people who were intelligent fucked over the rest of us as well. So give credit where its due. It&#39;s not like those &quot;sneaky Jews&quot; had super powers. They were just more intelligent than the rest of us.</p>

<p>Why do you mention <strong>persecuted</strong> here?  It doesn&#39;t follow.</p>

<p>If you mention it as a form of priming -- I&#39;m starting to recognize a pattern.  Any time anybody brings up any subject that Jews or Israel are associated with -- somebody inevitably brings up general persecution or if they want to break out the big guns, the holocaust.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re saying that they have sought power <em>because</em> of persecution -- the obvious question is &quot;to what end?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They were persecuted. Most people who doubt the holocaust also tell about some 100 countries they were banished from. Some which one is it? If they have weren&#39;t persecuted and always had power, then still they get the credit for that.</p>

<p>By denying historical facts, regardless of whether you believe in the holocaust or not, you won&#39;t be able to determine the future. I haven&#39;t looked into the holocaust being fake or not because i think there is sufficient evidence that they were persecuted so it doesn&#39;t matter whether the holocaust happened or not. I personally think i did happen. There is plenty of evidence it happened. You can doubt whether 6 million were killed or 2 million but Jewish people of Europe were rounded up and killed on an industrial scale. But that is not the discussion. The discussion is their power.</p>

<p>To what end? I dont know. Maybe they want to play god. Probably like a lot of people who have held even a tiny shred of power.</p>

<p>Jews are separate from Israel.  Israel is not separate from Jews.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can candy-coat Hafrada all you want.  It&#39;s most definitely the same as apartheid.  </p>

<p>Quoting a newspaper article from last year:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Apartheid&quot; isn&#39;t just a term of insult; it&#39;s a word with a very specific legal meaning, as defined by the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid, adopted by the U.N. General Assembly in 1973 and ratified by most United Nations member states (Israel and the United States are exceptions, to their shame).</p>

<p>According to Article II of that convention, the term applies to acts &quot;committed for the purpose of establishing and maintaining domination by one racial group of persons over any other racial group of persons and systematically oppressing them.&quot; Denying those others the right to life and liberty, subjecting them to arbitrary arrest, expropriating their property, depriving them of the right to leave and return to their country or the right to freedom of movement and of residence, creating separate reserves and ghettos for the members of different racial groups, preventing mixed marriages — these are all examples of the crime of apartheid specifically mentioned in the convention.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And while most Jews don&#39;t live in Israel, Israel <em>is</em> a Jewish State.</p>

<p><strong><em>The</em></strong> Jewish State in fact.  So when the Jewish State systematically oppresses a population that is Arab -- you see where I&#39;m going with this, right?  Jewish misbehavior.  </p>

<p>The understatement of the millennium.</p>

<p>I myself am an atheist and find American Christianity to be oppressive and judgmental (in our house we call it the American Taliban).</p>

<p>Why aren&#39;t you worried about fundies? Why aren&#39;t you pointing out how many congressmen/women are going to make oppressive medieval laws based on their interpretation of a 3,000 year old book? Why are you so obsessed with another person&#39;s private beliefs?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All those things may be interesting too. I stumbled in here because the OP posed an interesting question.  The comments have proven far more interesting than I&#39;d have expected.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Because of all the flack.  WWII bomber pilots had a saying:</p>

<blockquote>
<h1><a href="http://i.imgur.com/PpClngU.jpg">You know you are over the target when the flak is heaviest.</a></h1>
</blockquote>

<p>If I asked how many major corporations or industries are run by people who go to church every Sunday -- I&#39;d probably have people falling over themselves to give me the most up-to-date lists.</p>

<p>But this kid asked why nobody is allowed to mention apparent Jewish  control over the media -- and people come out of the woodwork to distract people from the question.</p>

<p>They go on the offensive to paint anyone who simply wants an answer precisely as the OP&#39;s question indicated they would.</p>

<p>Anything to deny, to distract, or whatever to get people away from the question. Even your comment does that.</p>

<h1>Methinks the distractors doth protest too much.</h1>

    <div class="md"><p>Regarding Jewish culture: it is cohesive and strong (I&#39;m generalizing a little here). And there isn&#39;t a strong belief in the afterlife, so they push their kids to excel academically and improve the family situation generation by generation. They also push their kids to college degrees like engineering &amp; science. These things taken together are why you see a disproportionate number of Jews in so many fields.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve stated here before: I am a big critic of Israel&#39;s politics and behavior in the middle east. It&#39;s unbelievable what they get away with, specifically in regards to human rights. But part of the reason they get away with it is people shouting &quot;the Joooz! The Joooz did everything!&quot; and being so anti-semitic. This discussion will never rise above the petty until we take the racism out of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See, the answer is simply that the culture is cohesive.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a simple answer.  If left at that, it&#39;s innocent enough.  I too, have preferences for who I work with.</p>

<p>But the Army that swoops in to vigorously deny any suggestion that Jews might like to hire other Jews -- well you see, <strong><em>that</em></strong> looks like a conspiracy.</p>

<p>And labelling even the most innocuous inquiry &quot;anti-semitism&quot; is not a good look.  Has conspiracy written all over it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve completely missed the point.  It&#39;s not about jealousy over someone&#39;s station in life.  None of us were ever going to be a Fortune 500 CEO anyway.</p>

<p>But when an identifiable demographic has a stranglehold on the channels through which almost everybody gets their information -- then it is automatically suspicious.  And because Jews make up only 1.4% of the US population, it is extraordinary that they&#39;d overwhelmingly control the media.</p>

<p>If you can control those information channels you control public discourse -- you control what conversations are even possible -- you control the democratic process.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure all those people have worked very hard and deserve all the success they&#39;ve enjoyed.  Nobody as far as I know has ever said otherwise.</p>

<p>And it doesn&#39;t require racism to wonder why the number of people of any demographic in any position of influence is wildly out of sync with that demographic&#39;s percentage of the general population.</p>

<p>And by wildly out of sync, we&#39;re looking at 100% of reputable media being controlled by an identifiable group that only represents 1.4% of the general population.</p>

<p>It is unquestionably extraordinary.</p>

<p>And it would not be unreasonable for someone to wonder if any <strong>overwhelming disparities like that also exist in banking and law.</strong>  </p>

<p>I mean, <strong><em>can you imagine a world in which a tiny population with strong in-group preferences controlled MONEY, LAW, and INFORMATION?</em></strong>  That group would be able to control everything that depends on money, law and/or information.</p>

<p>Even whether it&#39;s socially acceptable to question whether such a disparity exists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody is talking about any of that mishigas.</p>

<p>Instead, we&#39;re discussing the observation that a social group with strong in-group preferences has overwhelming control over money, law, and information.  </p>

<p>One observation about the people with that control, is that they&#39;re all Jewish.  It is not antisemitic to recognize that a person&#39;s name is a Jewish name.</p>

<p>Neither is it antisemitic to wonder why anyone who observes that all the people in control of our information are all Jewish -- is called names like &#39;anti-semite&#39;.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s not anti anything.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s a reasonable question.</p>

<p>Maybe the answer is that other people don&#39;t pursue that line of work.  Maybe other people are incapable of the work. Or maybe, just maybe, other people are somehow excluded from positions of power.</p>

<p>And if that were the case, it would be reasonable to wonder whether it were some sort of conspiracy -- and if so, what is the purpose of the conspiracy.  And what, if anything, is their agenda. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Claiming that the media and banking system are fucked up cause Jews is grounds for accusations of racism. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nobody in this thread has suggested that either the media or banking is fucked up.  I think direct deposit, ATM cards, and Game of Thrones are all wonderful.</p>

<p>The question was about why nobody is allowed to observe that those in control of those things are overwhelmingly members of a demographic that represents only 1.4% of the population.</p>

<p>Jews don&#39;t like this. They&#39;ve been trying to destroy America&#39;s culture for decades, via their almost total control over the mass media. Jews make up around 2% of the population. Why should they control OUR MEDIA? It doesn&#39;t make sense. Why should the white majority give over almost total control of the most powerful propaganda and brain-washing tool in the world to an alien tribe that constitutes only 2% of the population? Answer: it should not.</p>
