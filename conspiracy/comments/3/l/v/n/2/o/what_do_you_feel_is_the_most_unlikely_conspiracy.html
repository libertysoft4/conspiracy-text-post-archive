    <div class="md"><p>I believe human civilization is much older than we think it is.  I don&#39;t think aliens are involved, but there&#39;s so much that&#39;s out of place in our history that nothing else explains all of it.</p>

<p>There are odd coincidences in culture all over.  Mayans and Egyptians have a lot of similarities in their writing system.  The Hopi language is similar to Japanese.  The Vimenas in Hindu literature are basically aircraft.  And every culture on earth has a story in which the gods get pissed and almost destroy mankind (utnapishtim, Atlantis, Noah, etc).  Now, how does this make sense in conventional history?  How do you have the Hopi meet the Japanese, or the Egyptians meet the Maya, or teach the Hindus flight dynamics? How do you convince everyone that they used to have a utopia until they pissed off the gods and got destroyed?  Easy answer is to have a civilization that got destroyed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also that circumcision&#39;s true purpose is to mess with our (male&#39;s) maximum  maximum pleasure sensation.  This may have a plethora of effects which include<br/>
1) Affecting how our brain develops.  Some say that the brain area(s) which produces pleasure never needs to develop as much and leaves room for a more &quot;spiritual&quot; human being.  At first thought this might sound like a good reason, but I&#39;m skeptical of this being the case.<br/>
2) Causing relationship and attachment issues.   According to nurses and doctors, some circumcised infants have been anecdotally described as not being as trusting with their parents.<br/>
3) On average, causes a more introverted personality type   </p>

<p>Edit: Added u/LetsHackReality reason which I forgot!<br/>
4) Although episodic memory is most probably yet to be functional, emotional memory might linger.  Expanding on this; the traumatic, un-natural, immensely painful experience (anesthetics use to never be administered, now only a fraction get local anesthetics) which usually occurs soon after birth.  Nice first memory to be imprinted into an infantile mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate when people bring up aesthetic preference.  This is incredibly biased, and depending on your procedure, circumcision leaves a very noticeably scar, which is certainly not aesthetic.  It took me quite a while to figure this out, since we&#39;re only born with one penis.  </p>

<p>Additionally, I hate when people bring up sanitary benefits of circumsion.  Has evolution left us with an appendage that is so prone to infection that we need to alter it permanently by amputation?  It&#39;s normal to have to clean our bodies.  The laziness is legendary. </p>

<p>If it wasn&#39;t obvious I am an upset individual who was circumscribed against my free will.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>its quite apparent, although i dont think thats a wrong position. how do you reconcile aesthetic difference in your mind? of course it isnt a just response, but certainly at least in america, the preference is very real. most mothers asked will say circumcision simply because its what they are accustomed to. its a bad reason, but a very much existant one</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whether you believe in evolution or a creator, it&#39;s easy to feel that the human being should not be intentionally and unnecessarily mutilated.  Regardless, aesthetics are a function of what one is use to.  If there existed no circumcised penis, it wouldn&#39;t even cross anyone&#39;s mind, in addition to maintaining the normal and much more pleasurable sexual feeling due to thrusting. The circumcised penis also absorbs much more moisture and evaporates the rest due to high friction (no skin to act as a gliding sheath.)  </p>

<p>That&#39;s not to say some babies benefit from circumcision, and there a few of reasons why; one being tight and uncomfortable erections.  But this is quite difficult to determine at birth, and the solution is not to just cut everyone.</p>

<p>And yea, that&#39;s sort of the case with me.  The reason I was given was that she had it done because her husband (my father) was.  Typical sheep response. So sad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Subscribe to might be the wrong word, but I&#39;m quite interested in the idea that the top members of NASA and other space agencies collaborate to produce fake pictures and videos of planets and space.  It&#39;s definitely a real possibility.  The information, and videos which attempt to expose it are, for the most, part produced by people sounding like idiots.  I have a strange feeling this is by design though.  I just watched a video of a supposed Chinese crew repairing their spacecraft in space, and I am over 97% sure it was produced under water on Earth. The video very well might have been altered to make water look more transparent, removing the blue hue, in addition to speeding up the footage to remove the time delay that would be caused by viscosity.  There is also what seems to be bubbles occasionally percolating from the depressurized entrance/exit chamber and their suits.  The rebuttal proposed is that is was &quot;debris.&quot;</p>

<p>Anyway the conspiracy theory would be that we have yet to leave lower earth orbit.  This allows the existence of satellites which I have seen with my own eyes.  (They look like stable shooting stars , and you can catch them if you stare up at the sky long enough a few hours after sunset and later)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed.  I also am unsure why there are claims that landing on the moon isn&#39;t worth our time or effort, and that a few times in the 70&#39;s was enough.  I feel like setting up base there would open up the possibility to launch drones and humans out of an atmosphere-less environment with a substantially lesser gravity well.  The velocity that spaceships can reach far surpasses anything we could launch from earth.  </p>
