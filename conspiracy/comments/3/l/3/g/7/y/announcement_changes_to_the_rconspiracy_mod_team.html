        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">78</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2015-09-15 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/axolotl_peyotl.html">axolotl_peyotl</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In the interest of full disclosure, the following will hopefully explain recent events concerning <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and the mod team:</p>

<p>One of our mods, Orangutan, has been removed due to his company (Company A) having alleged financial ties to another company (Company B) through yet a third company (Company C). </p>

<p>We&#39;ve recently received documents between Company A and Company B (which can&#39;t be released for obvious doxxing reasons) which reveal that Orangutan&#39;s partner at Company A also owns Company C. </p>

<p>Company C received financial assistance from Company B. However, there&#39;s no record of Orangutan&#39;s Company A receiving assistance.</p>

<p>The financial assistance from Company B to Company C occurred during the 2013 tax year.</p>

<p>Note: all three companies are involved in the 9/11 truth movement.</p>

<p>Orangutan has denied any wrongdoing and insists he&#39;s never benefited financially from his company or his partner&#39;s company&#39;s reception of financial assistance from Company B.</p>

<p>The <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mod team has voted to remove Orangutan based on these allegations. Even if they&#39;re not true, keeping him on the mod team could still give the appearance of impropriety.</p>

<p>Part II of the saga, concerning AssuredlyAThrowaway:</p>

<p>The aforementioned documents were shown to AATA by another moderator here a few days ago.</p>

<p>AATA started a thread within the hour and stickied the post without any approval from the mod team.</p>

<p>Following much discussion amongst the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> moderators for the past few days, a vote was taken. It was decided that AATA should be demoted to the lowest spot on the mod team. </p>

<p>This morning, AATA was removed and invited back. AATA has not yet accepted the invitation and instead posted <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/3l2gvg/we_need_to_address_the_continuing_censorship_of/">this statement</a> to <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a>.</p>

<p>As a result, we will renew discussion on AATA&#39;s mod status.</p>

<p>We, the mod team, apologize for any actions taken or any conflicts of interest that have reflected poorly on this sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I own the website <a href="http://911blogger.com">9/11 Blogger</a>.  There were some finances that changed hands in I think 2013 with another leading 9/11 Truth organization, AE911Truth.org, and another owner of 9/11 Blogger.  I was not involved with this transaction and have never benefited financially from my work related to 9/11.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see my ownership position with 9/11 Blogger being a conflict of interest with me being a moderator here, I got involved in all this madness because I became passionate about 9/11 Truth after seeing a talk online by David Ray Griffin in Madison WI in I think 2005 or 2006.</p>

<p>I was a good mod here whose goal was representing the interests of the users above all else.  I was voted in around the time of the fake Richard Gage AMA fiasco and during a time of upheaval with the moderation team in general.  (I can&#39;t currently find the open thread where the community vote took place)  </p>

<p>I since brought in quality AMA&#39;s with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3l3g7y/announcement_changes_to_the_rconspiracy_mod_team/">James Corbett, Russ Baker, and Bill Still</a> and fought for stricter standards of proof for all AMA&#39;s as a general rule going forward.</p>

<p>Like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3l3g7y/announcement_changes_to_the_rconspiracy_mod_team/cv2ue0m">user jacks1000</a> I think people like Kevin Ryan, David Ray Griffin, Richard Gage, and Neils Harrit are people worth promoting while others are not.  My user history will show that.</p>

<p>With the way Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2nhv01/how_reddit_was_destroyed_ver20/">has gone over the years</a>, I&#39;d continually question the mods and criticize actions you think take away from the validity and legitimacy of the subreddit.  One mod, AssuredlyAThrowAway advocated for the outright banning of AE911Truth as a url on this subreddit.  Other mods have tried to stifle and limit what I consider legitimate criticism by overusing Rule 10.</p>

<p>I value quality investigative journalism and hope to see many more posts with links to organizations and people doing just that!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So this is the big &quot;payola scandal?&quot;</p>

<p>One of the mods runs pretty much the BEST 9/11 truth website out there.</p>

<p>Of course, this is exactly the kind of people we want involved in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. 
So, there is no &quot;payola scandal&quot; at all - that was a lie. The people saying that AE911Truth was paying people to manipulate <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> lied. That didn&#39;t happen at all.</p>

<p>One only needs to compare and constrast the quality of information at 911Blogger and AE911Truth to the nonsense often posted here about &quot;mini-nukes&quot; and &quot;micro-nukes&quot; and other such nonsense.</p>

<p>On the one hand, you have quality, evidence based explanations of 9/11. On the the other hand, you have complete nonsense. The same people promoting complete nonsense make up lies about &quot;payola.&quot;</p>

<p>It couldn&#39;t be more clear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point though is, if the Richard Gage scandal was not a &quot;high crime&quot; that warranted mod removal, then this surely isn&#39;t. How is running 911 Blogger a conflict of interest for fucks sake there is a sticky of a 911 Truth video on the sidebar right now, it&#39;s clearly within the interests of the community to have someone who moderates that actually represents and hold the views and opinions of a majority of the sub, and besides there is really no such thing as neutrality on this issue anyways, are we to be forever &quot;on the fence&quot; about everything to be considered &quot;credible&quot;? Fuck that.</p>

<p>You offered to step down, but the community overall chose to keep you as they felt you added value. But now, you and your buddies just decide without input to remove a mod, that was voted in by the community, without asking for the input from the community. So when it&#39;s you that fucks up, you get a chance to ask for forgiveness, but when it&#39;s someone else that &quot;fucks up&quot; (in your eyes), they get the banhammer no input required, and for shady and unclear reasons. Equality of justice clearly is not present in this decision. </p>

<p>A relevant and ancient story:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Buddha, on hearing about some particular religious practices, comments that there is no special merit in them, but rather that they are &quot;like the noise the hare heard.&quot; He then tells the story of a hare disturbed by a falling fruit who believes that the earth is coming to an end. The hare starts a stampede among the other animals until a lion halts them, investigates the cause of the panic and restores calm. The fable teaches the necessity for deductive reasoning and subsequent investigation.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps it would be in our best interests to establish a constitution. I say we pitch a sticky post up for a week or two, let the ideas flow in, let the mods deliberate and put it up there. It should only give general rules, such as no racism, no caps lock etc., or even things like no banning someone unless they break x amount of rules in x amount of times or whatever, but <strong>not</strong> something like the banning of a certain website link (unless it makes sense to do so). After the mods deliberate, they sticky what they came up with for a week and let the people help. If it needs more fixings, we can repeat the cycle (perhaps using time spans less than a week), if not, then put it below the rules. After this, nothing can change on the constitution (which will be an amendment listed in the constitution), unless we can agree on a voting system if something seriously needs to be changed. This is to prevent future cycles of mods from destroying the reddit (which happened in quite a few subreddits, including <a href="/r/astrophysics">/r/astrophysics</a> for a couple months), which we should realize we&#39;re never impervious to. It&#39;s simply to protect future sub-generations of redditors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for your comment, I agree with most of what you said and I apologize that my assertion that you have conflicting interest was warped by others into less accurate accusations such as &quot;payola or bribes&quot; because I don&#39;t think that to be the case AT ALL.</p>

<p>A few points that I don&#39;t completely agree with.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I since brought in quality AMA&#39;s with James Corbett, Russ Baker, and Bill Still and fought for stricter standards of proof for all AMA&#39;s as a general rule going forward.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We all pretty much agreed without a fight that the fake Richard Gage AMA was unacceptable and that stricter standards of verification were necessary.  And while I appreciate the quality AMAs that you managed to produce, your unwillingness to forgive your fellow moderators for the mistake made with the Gage AMA has not been a net benefit to the mod team.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Other mods have tried to stifle and limit what I consider legitimate criticism by overusing Rule 10.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is where the conflicting interests are most visible,  The users who were spouting off ridiculous accusations such as &quot;You&#39;re a nazi scumbag&quot; and &quot;You faked the Richard Gage AMA to discredit the truth movement&quot; were all cut from the same cloth, fanatical AE911 supporters.  You had absolutely no problem with us banning racist users for breaking rule 10 or any other users that I can remember for breaking rule 10. But when one of these AE911 (the fake gage crew, as they came to be called) were repeatedly breaking rule 10 you ended up with your foot in the door for them almost every time.  That is the definition of biased action.</p>

<p>I know we aren&#39;t going to agree about the bias that was evident to me as well as others so i&#39;ll just leave it at that.</p>

<p>Lastly, the suggestion to ban AE911truth.org URLs from being shared on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> was probably the stupidest suggestion that I&#39;ve ever heard. That will never happen with any URL on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>Sorry for parting like this.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>I&#39;ll be idling on the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> IRC channel linked in our sidebar if anyone is inclined to interrogate me.</p>

<p>I agree with you and am sorry you were demodded over this.</p>

<p>The government knows from the Cold War that the best way to fight ideology it doesn&#39;t like is to criticise its proponents for being forced to exist within the present capitalist system. It is fairly ludicrous really. People fighting capitalism being criticised because they are simultaneously forced to obey the rules of capitalism by the same people they are fighting!</p>

<p>The same applies to the 9/11 Truth Movement. The people we are fighting are trying to rupture the solidarity we have fought so hard to achieve, and are using the same Cold War fallacy that if you make any money from your beliefs, they are to be discredited on that basis alone.</p>

<p>Maybe I don&#39;t know the full story, but being paid is not evidence of all that much. Perhaps the problem was with the financial disclosure on your part, I don&#39;t know. Whatever it is though, I remember having a conversation with Flytape about this where he basically tried to convince me that the entire A/E Truth Movement was crooked. Begged him for evidence, and apparently in his eyes this request was satisfied by posting its non-profit tax status.</p>

<p>We&#39;re on a conspiracy forum. There are lots of paranoid people around. I think the basis of this business about &quot;financial ties&quot; is the government&#39;s effort to utilise that paranoia to its own advantage.</p>

<p>Bro, you tried to discredit the entire organisation in one broad stroke. You claimed it was a business taking funds in exchange for results, which retains its employees by paying them a salary. When I asked you for evidence of your claims you consistently failed to provide anything which substantiated them.</p>

<p>Where do you think 9/11 Truth would be without A/E? What credibility do you think we would have without these guys?</p>

<p>Absolutely fucking none, is what. We wouldn&#39;t even know what was used to bring the towers down. NIST would still be claiming WTC7 never entered mechanical freefall.</p>

<p>Everything those guys have done and said has seriously undermined the government&#39;s story. Their research is publicly available.

    <div class="md"><p>Right.</p>

<p>The OP goes out of its way to state that he did not get money as some have stated.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>there&#39;s no record of Orangutan&#39;s Company A receiving assistance.
The financial assistance from Company B to Company C occurred during the 2013 tax year.
Note: all three companies are involved in the 9/11 truth movement.
Orangutan has denied any wrongdoing and insists he&#39;s never benefited financially from his company or his partner&#39;s company&#39;s reception of financial assistance from Company B.</p>

<p>The OP is the one that set up a fake AMA with Richard Gage - and those two mods are the ones complaining about a &quot;conflict of interest&quot; because orangutan runs the most popular 911 Truth site, 911blogger.com.</p>

<p>They may or may not have shared resources, like internet hosting, three years ago.</p>

<p>Considering axolotl_peyotl posted a completely FAKE AMA about AE911Truth, isn&#39;t it a conflict of interest for him to have ANY say on anything related to AE911Truth anymore?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m noticing an ongoing pattern here with my comments related to situations regarding mods and the ongoing issues that takes place here. </p>

<p>I have yet to see any hard evidence of the removed mod <a href="/u/Orangutan">/u/Orangutan</a> being proven guilty of anything. I have only words from other mods stating that there&#39;s a conflict of interest. </p>

<p>As skeptics of all subjects we should remain open minded and look at things from all angles. Especially facts. Mods that claim to have these facts cannot release them due to doxxing. I get that. Yet I still have no personal proof to ponder. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not for or against any mod but I am sceptical of each mod in every subreddit all the same. I&#39;ve never personally had any bad experiences with any mod here. </p>

<p>Any way we can see documents without doxxing anyone? In a sub that questions sources and asks for proof or links to such; this is hardly an unusual request. </p>

<p>Additionally-</p>

<p>Like I have previously, I&#39;m going to ask again...What&#39;s up with the inactive mod in this sub <a href="/u/9000sins">/u/9000sins</a>? There&#39;s been very little activity on their part. One post I recently remember vividly from 9000sins was a bizarre stripper ritual supposed illuminati YouTube link. C&#39;mon now. That&#39;s what stands out to me the most about a mod that&#39;s up on the list of current mods here. That&#39;s saying something serious IMO. If they aren&#39;t willing or able to participate here then we need to question that. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve brought similar questions up previously regarding inactive mods. I&#39;m not implying there&#39;s any mal intent on their part personally. But we should however consider removing a mod higher on the ladder who hardly ever participates here. Especially if there is going to another vote for mod(s). </p>

<p>Going back to 2011, I was only able to locate one other grant in the amount of $2,430 in 2012. It&#39;s not listed who received the grant as it was under the $5,000 threshold. I&#39;ve not yet located the 2014 filling. </p>

<p>This is about as far as I can post without doxxing anyone.  The information is open source and not very hard to locate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will respond to this question only because I feel that you have some misconceptions about me and what I do. I was the first active mod on this sub since it&#39;s inception and helped to build this sub into what it has become today. I used to eat, sleep and breathe <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. I created all of the original CSS code by myself even though I hardly knew CSS. It&#39;s since been replaced by much better code, but I the some of the original changes I made are still here today such as the sidebar image. I had a son a couple of years ago, and it has put a serious damper on my availability. I sincerely apologize to all of the subscribers of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> for my lack of participation. I would never abuse my position of power, and I will never censor anyone who isn&#39;t breaking the sub rules or using abusive language, and even then not after a warning. I may be a little crazy, and my tastes in conspiracies may be a little strange for some, but I like to keep it weird. I used to be at the top of the mod list just under illuminatedwax and donbueno, but I and all of the other mods at the time were removed as mods by the latter for instituting a rule he didn&#39;t like. We were reinstated but the order was different.</p>

<p>Long story short, I have very little time for moderation duties at the moment, but I am waiting patiently for the day when I have the time. I love all of you, and I&#39;m sorry.</p>

<p>AATA, you claim that Flytape got someone&#39;s 1099s because a 501(c)(3) org&#39;s tax filings can be publicly inspected. How was this possible?</p>

<p><strong>The IRS&#39; public inspection process requires availability of only annual returns and some forms filed only when the organization starts, not the 1099s. And neither the annual return (Form 990) nor the instructions for completing it require that 1099s be attached to the return. So from where I&#39;m sitting, it looks like 1099s can&#39;t be obtained by the public.</strong></p>

Did you somehow create Sherlock Holmes to figure out that <a href="/u/orangutan">/u/orangutan</a> ran a 9/11 blog?   Or contact that group that drives around in a van and solves mysteries with a dog?  </p>

<p>I have been researching 9/11 for over 13 years, and have seen his user name on different sites.  He isn&#39;t hawking ware&#39;s or selling books, and you are totally in the wrong for even making an issue of this.  The better question is what did you do that you are trying to divert attention from.  </p>

<p>If you actually paid attention to anything he posts, which he has been doing for years, they are things that are actually a benefit to the movement, and not crap like a lot of the things I see posted here.  You will voat to un mod him here, yet flytape is still hanging form a ceiling somewhere as a mod.  </p>

<p>Brilliant move mods, de mod one of the the persons putting out credible info as it relates to conspiracies and 9/11 in particular, and leave the others.  Makes total sense.</p>

<p>They are trying to divert attention from the fact that they faked a Richard Gage AMA and that they are posting well known disinformation about 9/11.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the whole point of this - to get rid of all credible 9/11 Truth advocates so they can post more &quot;Illuminati Space Beams Nuked the WTC&quot; and Flat Earth crap.</p>

<p>Some people on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> like to discuss government propaganda, disinformation, the Deep State, and corporate cover ups.</p>

<p>Some people on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> like to make up stories about Illuminati Lizards and Bigfoots and Aliens and detailed descriptions of Satanic child sex orgies.</p>

<p>Getting rid of AE911Truth and other credible 9/11 Truth advocates will go a long way to turning <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> into the latter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is at least 50% shit, likely more so.</p>

<p>I suggest anyone who is interested in 9/11 go to <a href="/r/911Truth">/r/911Truth</a>, a highly credible and well moderated sub full of high quality submissions.</p>

<p>The moderators at <a href="/r/911Truth">/r/911Truth</a> have never made up a completely fake AMA with one of the most well-known 9/11 Truthers - but <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has.</p>

<p>So this place <em>is</em> silly, and at least some of the mods are working hard to make sure it stays that way, and gets worse.</p>

<p>There are more.</p>

<p>I think axolotl_peyotl&#39;s bias is showing, and his willingness to be deceptive about AE911Truth and the low quality nonsense 911 posts that have been spammed all over <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> in the last few days.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right and that&#39;s despicable. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s the thing: even if you think a certain topic is disinfo, you should <em>relish</em> the opportunity to educate people when they post about it.</p>

<p>When you stifle discussion on an issue or theory, you do your entire cause a disservice, because you prevent folks from being fully educated.</p>

<p>You got someone&#39;s 1099s because a 501(c)(3) org&#39;s tax filings can be publicly inspected. How was this possible?
The IRS&#39; public inspection process requires availability of only annual returns and some forms filed only when the organization starts, not the 1099s. And neither the annual return (Form 990) nor the instructions for completing it require that 1099s be attached to the return. So from where I&#39;m sitting, it looks like 1099s can&#39;t be obtained by the public.</p>

<p><strong>I have no dog in this fight but I do have an accounting degree and this idea that someone got 1099s via some public inspection process got my senses tingling.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>What are you even talking about?  I&#39;m simply pointing out that your initial comment contained a lie, period.  The sub is not &quot;full&quot; of posts like that and it&#39;s incredibly disingenuous of you to make that claim and then only cite one single user.</p>

<p>You should also look up the definition of evidence as there definitely <em>is</em> evidence behind the theory.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Evidence (definition taken from an old dictionary): That which elucidates and/or enables the mind to see truth; proof arising from our own perceptions by the senses, or from the testimony of others, or from inductions of reason.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The essential point is that evidence, and its credibility, is decided on a person by person basis.  What is evident to me may not be evident to you, and vice a versa.  So there may not be good evidence, or it may not be acceptable evidence for you personally (i.e. the claim of mini-nukes is not <strong>evident</strong> to you), but it&#39;s inaccurate to say that none exists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No less important*</p>

<p>I oppose censorship for the most part. I&#39;ve found it stifles discussion. Then again, I&#39;ve witnessed freedom of speech spoil the discussion. What particularly complicates things is the sheer and utter amount of disinformation and satire that especially floods these spheres of academic and journalistic inquiry.</p>

<p>Robert Anton Wilson was fond of saying something like &quot;the funny thing is, there&#39;s not a conspiracy out there that&#39;s so crazy that somebody else somewhere didn&#39;t already figure it out and start blaring &#39;the truth&#39; with their megaphones.&quot;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think ae911 truth is that kind of disinfo or satirical conspiracy. 9/11 blogger has been my favorite site when researching details of 9/11 for it&#39;s thoroughness and fact-check ability.</p>

<p>I seriously doubt that Orangutan did anything but make this subreddit better/ and with his loss_ this is a sad day for <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>Sadder than the day you made that ridiculous video for me at least. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a fan of David Ray Griffin, Richard Gage, Steven Jones and Neils Harrit.</p>

<p>These are the leaders of the actual 9/11 Truth movement, and they are the ones that have provided evidence of their claims.</p>

<p>&quot;Dimitry Kholslov&quot; &quot;Gordon Duff&quot; and &quot;Judith Woods&quot; are bullshit artists.</p>

<p>Also, I posted one link to a theory I&#39;d never heard about until today - and you and another user jumped in IMMEDIATELY to insult me, instead of quickly and simply debunking the theory (which I probably could debunk, but not going to do your work for you).</p>

<p>I&#39;ve already seen it - I&#39;ve seen all of them. I&#39;ve been observing the attacks on Jones for nearly a decade.</p>

<p>The same people attacking ae911Truth are the same people posting bullshit from Judith Woods and the &quot;mini-nuke&quot; nonsense.</p>

<p>AE911Truth is the ONLY credible 9/11 truth group.</p>

<p>Name another 9/11 Truth group with anything close to the support that AE911Truth has from scientists, engineers, eyewitnesses, architects, etc.</p>

<p>There are NONE. It&#39;s literally the only credible truth group.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No less important*</p>

<p>I oppose censorship for the most part. I&#39;ve found it stifles discussion. Then again, I&#39;ve witnessed freedom of speech spoil the discussion. What particularly complicates things is the sheer and utter amount of disinformation and satire that especially floods these spheres of academic and journalistic inquiry.</p>

<p>Robert Anton Wilson was fond of saying something like &quot;the funny thing is, there&#39;s not a conspiracy out there that&#39;s so crazy that somebody else somewhere didn&#39;t already figure it out and start blaring &#39;the truth&#39; with their megaphones.&quot;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think ae911 truth is that kind of disinfo or satirical conspiracy. 9/11 blogger has been my favorite site when researching details of 9/11 for it&#39;s thoroughness and fact-check ability.</p>

<p>I seriously doubt that Orangutan did anything but make this subreddit better/ and with his loss_ this is a sad day for <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>Sadder than the day you made that ridiculous video for me at least. </p>

<p>Maybe not as sad as when the upvote downvotes counter was removed.</p>

<p>Maybe that is part of the problem. You start off the announcement with &quot;in the interest of full disclosure&quot; but you really haven&#39;t fully disclosed anything and that is why people are confused and wanting more clear answers. </p>
