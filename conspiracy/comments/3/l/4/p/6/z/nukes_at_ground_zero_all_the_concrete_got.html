<p>I&#39;m most concerned with the fact that people who are promoting this theory are also attacking AE911 Truth. I&#39;m sure everyone who has been here more than a month has seen the fantastic research and watched the interviews they have produced. They are also one of the few groups that has managed to get major billboards up.</p>

<p>AE911 Truth rarely attacks other theorists, but the proponents of other theories attack AE911 truth relentlessly.</p>

<p>Didn&#39;t know there were teams, when looking for the truth. Sounds like you buy into partisan politics.</p>

<p>So mainstream? We all know what happens when that happens.</p>

<p>If you are familiar with gatekeepers, they very well could be a front.</p>

<p>As for your &quot;evidence&quot; of intact steel and concrete, you obviously have not look into the theory. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lec9giab90I">Let Dimitri shed some light for you</a>. If you are honest and want to find the truth, I&#39;d suggest hearing <em>all sides</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There shouldn&#39;t be teams. I started hearing about the nuke theory from groups of people who attack AE911. Hear all sides, sure... but the evidence is not strong for a nuke. It simply doesn&#39;t explain the mechanics of the collapse.</p>

<p>No visible compression wave.</p>

<p>If you can give me some specific link explaining the columns of concrete intact at the base sections of the tower, I&#39;ll look at it. A four hour video... I&#39;m not going to do that again. I&#39;ve already sat through a lot of Dimitri over the months.</p>

<p>No you haven&#39;t. If you did, you&#39;d understand the mechanics of the theory. An underground nuclear explosion does not look/act like an atmospheric explosion. There is no compression wave visible. Maybe on a flat plane, but not with a building over it. </p>

<p>So, you admit, you do not want to here other sides. Got it, that&#39;s all I need to hear. I watched the 4 hour video, the 2 hour A&amp;E for 9/11 and others. Hearing all sides. To each their own.

<p>It looks like a controlled demolition. You put the collapses next to 50 controlled demolitions and it is rare to find one that looks significantly different.

    <div class="md"><p>And I know you comment all over the board, plc =P.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think they could have convincingly sold the story of fire initiated collapse on the towers unless they destroyed the building from the collapse down.</p>

<p>A traditional demolition favors taking out the base and crushing the building under the maximum mass. They had to detonate it as it collapsed to be convincing.</p>

<p>The look and feel they were going for kind of takes a nuke out of the equation. A nuke would have destroyed the base first... like most demolitions look.</p>

<p>I was really considering this and the &quot;No Planes&quot; theory. Both have an air of plausibility about them. I&#39;m just concerned with the fact that they Nuke Camp is outright attacking AE911.</p>

<p>2300 Architects and engineers are onboard for AE911 truth.
How many physicists... support this? Not even nuclear... just plain old physicists. </p>

<p>Meanwhile all these PHD prima donna&#39;s are protecting flimsy bits of paper or electronic data and their Brilliant Theory is: Mine Is The One And Only!</p>

<p>As a lay person, I&#39;m fed up! I have a damned right to ask about the other four buildings destroyed on that morning! </p>

<p>I have a right to be fed up when an AMA is clearly bogus! Also have a right to celebrate when another responds like a living breathing being person! (James C.)</p>

<p>Yet, others in here, myself included, are not allowed to discuss <em>additional</em> forms of destruction at Ground Zero, on 9/11/01? </p>

<p>I get it!</p>

<p>What are you going to do about <em>it</em>?</p>

<p>What are you going to do about <em>you</em>?</p>

<p>Free thinking is being shredded by the nano seconds and I&#39;m appalled.</p>

<p>AE911 Truth rarely attacks other theorists, but the proponents of other theories attack AE911 truth relentlessly.</p>

<p>They kind do though. Here is a video of a guy who donated to ae911 for years and got banned from their site for linking another theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good link. He banned him from his site. You saw how he didn&#39;t disparage Judy woods or the guy during any of that. He even offered to go have a beer with the guy to talk about it. He let the speaker have five minutes and ask a number of questions when he said, sixty seconds at the beginning, and he talked to him again after the presentation.</p>

<p>He banned him from a private forum. That&#39;s quite a different thing from attacking other theorists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There shouldn&#39;t be teams. I started hearing about the nuke theory from groups of people who attack AE911. Hear all sides, sure... but the evidence is not strong for a nuke. It simply doesn&#39;t explain the mechanics of the collapse.</p>

<p>No visible compression wave.</p>

<p>If you can give me some specific link explaining the columns of concrete intact at the base sections of the tower, I&#39;ll look at it. A four hour video... I&#39;m not going to do that again. I&#39;ve already sat through a lot of Dimitri over the months.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I respect the sub and learned, discovered so much in my shock and unease. </p>

<p>I posted one link there asking about TSA footage alleged to have been from the morning of 9/11 and I was respected and others joined in with helpful remarks, links.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not settled in any one <em>camp</em> or mind-set of WWWWW...</p>

<p>Perhaps the youth in here know best how to steer this flimsy boat!</p>

<p>JSYK, I appreciate the difficulty the Mods in here face. </p>

<p>I&#39;m running out of time and I do get some shit wrong. I do my best to correct my errors.</p>

<p>Watching this forum flame out like digg? Which is how I found reddit and every time I acknowledge A.S. in here...</p>

<p>I&#39;m tired. The salmonella just keeps on tearing me up.</p>

<p>To old perhaps...</p>

<p>I need an EL5 to sort out this debacle.</p>

<p>Not all of your elders are selfish, money grubbing, soul suckers and some of us have been in the trenches for decades.</p>

<p>Dream great dreams! Dream well!</p>
