    <div class="md"><p>I legit don&#39;t get how people like Larry can smile. He obviously doesn&#39;t have what most people refer to as a &#39;soul&#39;. He doesn&#39;t have empathy, he doesn&#39;t feel emotions. Nothing has meaning to him, I don&#39;t understand, he obviously doesn&#39;t care about being alive or dead, he doesn&#39;t care his family, he doesn&#39;t care about the future, his country, his homeland, nothing, he&#39;s just a dead beaten hollow empty puppet of a human being, incapable of contentment or reaction.</p>

<p>So what goes through his brain, what is the neurological structure of these people? Honestly I kind of understand how people end up believing in the lizard people shit, because it&#39;s a pretty good explanation of how someone like Larry Silverstein is able to function as a living organism yet at the same time doesn&#39;t have a fully functioning consciousness. It&#39;s bizarre, it&#39;s like he&#39;s a programmable robot or something, just input the code and beep boop he&#39;ll do whatever is programmed into him. Fucking bizarre, really does anyone else have an answer? I can&#39;t figure it out, there&#39;s 0 logic. No value of life, can&#39;t value his own life, yet willing to go so far for money for a life that he doesn&#39;t value??? My brain is about to fucking melt this is so stupid...</p>

<p>He doesn&#39;t have emotions so he can&#39;t feel empathy. </p>

<p>But if he can&#39;t feel emotions then why would he value his own life so much.</p>

<p>He values 0 other lives, so life to him has 0 value.</p>

<p>Yet his life has value, yet no value, so he cares about his life but he can&#39;t comprehend that other things are alive so life is nothing yet he values nothing so he&#39;s hollow so he doesn&#39;t care about being alive and why does everything suddenly taste like copper?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The great thing about the West today is that assassinations are no longer necessary. In the past they were because the vote was unified and the population was homogeneous. Today, with the injection of foreign populations into European society mixed with the flipping of values and social thought through liberalism, true conservatism or libertarian-ism poses no threat. Everything has been secured from the government to the dinner table. These people can never become president today. They&#39;ve completely removed any possibility for strong leadership for liberal values and political majorities that pander back and forth, completely masking the corporate strings above. The reason we can&#39;t have leaders is because our borders have been secretly dismantled under neo-liberal &quot;free&quot; market.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After the pro-911 neocon Dem is nominated to run against the pro-911 neocon Rep I&#39;ll be voting for Gary Johnson again and hoping enough people vote against the pro-murder duopoly to get more choice happening by 2020.
