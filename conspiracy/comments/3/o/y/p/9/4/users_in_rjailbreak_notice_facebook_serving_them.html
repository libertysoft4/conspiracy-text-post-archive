<p>Close all the apps on your phone including Facebook. Put on a Spanish speaking channel, and leave your phone next to the speaker all night. </p>

<p>Explain to me why over the next few days you see Spanish language ads all over Facebook. This shit is real whether we like it or not. ￼</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not the type to get mad or upset if it doesn&#39;t do it for anyone else. We need truth in our lives. I would much rather be thankful and grateful to learn that this isn&#39;t actually happening and that my experience must have been a coincidence. </p>

<p>I&#39;m the conspiracy theorist, or as I like  to think I try to speak  truth about conspiracies that are based on fact or proven true, that allthe coincidence theorist&#39; LOVE to hate. They can&#39;t bury their head in the sand and attack me with &quot;your a psycho who wants this stuff to be true and thinks EVERYTHING is a conspiracy.&quot; </p>

<p>Uh no, I&#39;m a decent person who doesn&#39;t enjoy the world being a living hell. That&#39;s not my idea of a good time here on Earth. I love and care for all living things. I don&#39;t enjoy violence, death, gore, or any of that shit. I only subject myself to it when it is beneficial to me in an educational/informing way. </p>

<p>If people would just think...there are charges of conspiracy made in American courts every single day. Many of them end up being true. Do you really think there isn&#39;t fucked up people at the apex of human civilization just as well at the very bottom? I do not enjoy having to tell everyone I know some cold hard truths about reality, and it almost always takes quite a while to get them to come around and &quot;get it&quot;, if they ever do. Until that happens, my relationships with them are ruined and strained. Some flat out end. Why do I continue to do it? </p>

<p>Because...A LOT OF THIS SHIT IS REAL. It&#39;s our duty as human beings to try and save people we love and care about from living and DYING, never knowing the truth. To me, and I&#39;m sure a GREAT many others, this makes it worth it to be ostracized and attacked endlessly by idiots on Reddit, and in real life. I hope at least one person reads this and can relate that I am a normal not insane person and I would not go around trying to convince someone of something that isn&#39;t true. I could really give a fuck what people think for the most part, but I think they deserve to know about the world they live in at the very least. No sane person would WANT this shit to be true. </p>
