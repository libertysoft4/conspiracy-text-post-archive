        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>&quot;Recent reports from <em>Genie, a US oil-exploration company</em>, suggest oil has been found in Israel. Lots of it.</p>

<p>Cautionary statements from experts have followed: there is a difference between oil in the ground and oil that can be brought to the surface cost-effectively.</p>

<p>And as long as OPEC oil-exporting nations are setting a very low price per barrel, bringing Israeli oil to the surface would be more difficult, financially speaking.</p>

<p>The oil is actually in the Golan Heights, which was taken by Israel, from Syria, in the 1967 war. The ownership of the area is still contested. (Haaretz: “Genie Confirms Report of Possible Big Golan Oil Find,” Oct 11, 2015)</p>

<p>That’s not all. Genie, the US company that is doing the drilling-exploration in Golan, has some very interesting characters on its strategic advisory board—men who can exert influence on all sorts of geo-political operations.</p>

<p>For example, Rupert Murdoch; and Jacob Rothschild, the chairman of the Rothschild Foundation and the J Rothschild group of companies.</p>

<p>For example, ex-CIA director James Woolsey.</p>

<p>And Dick Cheney.</p>

<p>And Lawrence Summers, former president of Harvard University, former Secretary of the Treasury under Bill Clinton, director of the National Economic Council under Obama. (Will we see the involvement of the Harvard Endowment Fund in this Israeli oil operation?)</p>

<p>And Bill Richardson, former Secretary of Energy under Bill Clinton.</p>

<p>. . . Exactly how long ago did the Genie people actually know there was oil under the Golan? Did they delay their announcement, to make it seem as if the Syrian escalation was just an unrelated coincidence?</p>

<p>Depending on the size of the oil find under the Golan, the whole configuration of oil-control in the Middle East could be affected. Who has it, who owns it, who sells it, who buys it, and who sets the price.</p>

<p>Go look into the backstory of T. E. Lawrence before the outbreak of the First World War and what he was doing in Syria. Sure, he was a legitimate archaeologist, but he was there basically as a spy. At the same time there were Americans in the region as well, working for private oil interests in the US, scouting for oil. </p>

<p>They&#39;ve known the region was ripe with oil for over a century.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>TIL: Murdoch is involved in oil companies. No wonder NewsCorp is so rabidly anti-renewables in Australia.</p>

<p>Having Murdoch, Rothschild, Cheney and Woolsey all on the same &quot;advisory board&quot; for an oil exploration company with exclusive rights to Israel is shady as fuck, and that&#39;s without even looking at the other people involved, like Mary Landrieu.</p>
