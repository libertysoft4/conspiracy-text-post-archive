        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We have all been conditioned from the moment we were born. Even those of us who frequently explore these controversial topics have to undo years of conditioning. Let me give you an example.</p>

<p>Growing up, I definitely was one to be critical of the government and I even bought a 9/11 truth t-shirt in high school. I was largely influenced by my dad&#39;s open mindedness about conspiracies. Let&#39;s just say I  have always been an open-minded person.</p>

<p>But even somebody like me (not that I think I&#39;m so great) can be caught in the conditioning. Last year on Facebook I was arguing with anti-vaxers. I thought they were so stupid and ridiculous. How could anybody question vaccines? They are good for us! They help us! Right?</p>

<p>Well that was where my mind was settled, and honestly it wasn&#39;t going to change. The thing was I never even investigated vaccines. I just could not go past my conditioning. It&#39;s hard to explain but that belief was already implanted in my mind. </p>

<p>One day I saw a post on here from a credible doctor on some of the possible consequences of using too many vaccines at an early age. My mind was blown. Some of that conditioning had been chipped away.</p>

<p>Now I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m completely anti vaccines now. I still need to investigate.</p>

<p>However, I am saying I am not shocked anymore that people can&#39;t just wake up so easily. </p>

<p>Now, clearly I had some things going for me. I grew up in a pretty open-minded household and was told to question everything. That is NOT the typical American household.</p>

<p>I think I have a very small group of people that I can even discuss conspiracies with, and the sad part is that much of what is posted here on this subreddit is not even necessarily conspiracy related. Rather news is posted here that has been censored from the front page.</p>

<p>Everybody seems so apathetic. After all the changes with Reddit, I am surprised it just seems like everybody is okay with all the censorship (or you are all on Voat, which has been taken over, too).</p>

<p>What I&#39;m trying to say is how can people wake up? The odds are against them. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not hopeless though. I just feel that I finally am starting to understand the extent of the conditioning. It permeates every aspect of our societies and minds.</p>

<p>Well, I know this post is a little dramatic and shills will step in asap, but I wanted to share my thoughts. I feel like the best we can all do is chip away at our conditioning first, and then the conditioning of others if possible. I guess I ask everyone to explore their biases and beliefs. Have you truly examined and questioned them? If not, what&#39;s stopping you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would be great if there were a formula for waking people up.  The best way I&#39;ve figured out is to just keep mentioning topics and information to your friends and wait for something to peak their interest.  There&#39;s so much to the power structure and it&#39;s so interconnected that it&#39;s impossible to just explain someone&#39;s eyes open.  All you can really do is make them aware of something they actually give a shit about and hope they dig those rabbit holes.
It&#39;s like with your vaccine example, I had a similar thought(or lack of) process about their safety.  It&#39;s hard to see the truth when you aren&#39;t searching for it, at that point all your opinions seep into you out of the static drone of popular media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The best way I&#39;ve seen to influence people is the meme approach.  It clearly works the most effeciently because that&#39;s what the modern media is using.  Just have to keep on saying the same, condensed packets of information again and again in an easy to digest manner.  Winning debates and educating are very low success rate methods due to how people have been influenced. Sometimes, you have to fight fire with fire and lower your standards a bit to come out on top.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Memes would make sense in that several years ago I saw a post that mentioned the military had studied and discovered that the best method for someone to learn and retain information was a comic book style of learning. The combination of reading and images makes the largest impact by using different areas of the brain. I could see memes slowly eating away at the walls of conditioning built in the minds of the populace.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason people around the world do not wake up is because they are Fearful of the truth. I would also like to say most people simply do not have the courage to wake up. Can you imagine what the world would do if even one of the theories in this blog were true? If only one ufo were real, if only one ghost were real? If ordinary people knew that actually there are far more powerful people behind the sc new than their government? And I am not saying that these powerful people are malevolent actually just they keep vast vast secrets because they feel they have to.</p>

<p>There is a growing and continuous hatred of capitalism and the rich. But this is wholly naïve in truth. The protests (see UK) against austerity and the dumbass anti-gentrification lobby, are wholly ignorant to the nature of economics. But ordinary &#39;unawakened&#39; people follow the crowd like sheep. They are too scared or lacking the thought to research and educate themselves. They also think that the rich are part of a huge conspiracy against them. Most of the rich are not like that at all - philanthropy being a major pursuit. The fear takes hold though and so they march, thinking this will make a difference but of course it cannot.</p>

<p>Therefore somewhere within us all is a sense that what we have been told or educated in such as typical history or archeology, the flawed theory of evolution (by the way creationism is flawed also when tied with religion which is a whole other crapfest) - somewhere within all of us is a primal instinct that the truth is rather different than what society programmes. Those if us who are Awake realise holy shit there is so much more to life and human existence. The simple truths are that, for example to throw a general spread of conspiracies out there: ghosts are real, so are ufos, aliens, abductions, human beings were genetically created by an advanced race of beings from somewhere else (religion mistakes these beings for &#39;God&#39;), a Spiritual God does exist but that is a different story and certainly nothing to do with the &#39;gods&#39; everyone seems to refer to. Both Mars and the Moon have evidence of past visitations and life. To continue: Jfk was assassinated by more than one gunman and certainly not Oswald, 911 was a terrible terrible tragedy for the USA however all is not what they want you to think. Just dissect the Pentagon evidence to expose huge fractures in what was presented as the truth.</p>

<p>But again, most people just want to live average lives, they don&#39;t want any trouble, they exist, not LIVE their lives. This is comfortable and safe. So most ridicule even the concept of the truth that is out there :-) but you have to understand, as I am sure you must reading this blog, most ordinary folk cannot comprehend nor do they want to, the possibilities within themselves let alone the truth of human-kind. It is simply too much, too frightening. As an analogy: plenty of folk will ramble on about what they will do when they win the lottery. However those very people will fk it up if they have not made a deliberate attempt to understand and manage money. Hence why most lottery winners lose it. Actually winning the huge amount (knowing the real truth aka) is so far out of their reality they cannot deal with it.</p>

<p>To be Awake is to understand the labyrinthian levels within ourselves but also realizing the tremendous hidden knowledge is in fact not so hidden after all if you care to look for it properly. With that comes responsibility: do you tell the ordinary folk and terrify them? Or do you understand why there have to be secrets or the ordinary folk riot and cause destruction?</p>

<p>I can tell you one thing, the question to Bernie Sanders about Hillary Clinton&#39;s hair is super fucking important.  His answer showed everyone that he does not know the truth.</p>
