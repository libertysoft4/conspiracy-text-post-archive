    <div class="md"><p>You have the emergence in human society 
of this thing that&#39;s called the State
What is the State? The State is this organized bureaucracy
It is the po-lice department. It is the Army, the Navy
It is the prison system, the courts, and what have you
This is the State -- it is a repressive organization
But the state -- and gee, well, you know, 
you&#39;ve got to have the police, cause.. 
if there were no police, look at what you&#39;d be doing to yourselves!
You&#39;d be killing each other if there were no police! 
But the reality is..
the police become necessary in human society 
only at that junction in human society 
where it is split between those who have and those who ain&#39;t got.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems we forget about personal responsibility (TRUE anarchy) far too often. Most problems are NOT a result of human nature, rather symptoms of a system that breeds individuals to behave certain ways. What is human nature? We probably haven&#39;t the slightest idea. </p>

<p>We (collective society) still want authority figures/institutions to lead and guide us, which is the opposite of self-empowerment. Activists want to change the system from within instead of stepping back, outside the system with an objective view of reality. </p>

<p>This is the problem. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Greed, envy, wrath, anger, vanity and so forth are the causes of all of our ills as humans. This is well established in both the mind sciences (psychology and sociology) and most religions across the globe.</p>

<p>Until EVERYONE loses these drives within, there is no system that can work. </p>

<p>Yes, it would take personal responsibility, but look around, most can&#39;t even manage their day to day lives because of interference from the above listed problems.</p>

<p>Someone always want&#39;s the positions of power because they think they can do it better, but we all know how that works out. What&#39;s the reason for this drive? Envy, greed and vanity as examples.</p>

<p>When we humans cross these lines in a negative manner, it get&#39;s brutal from the one that was done wrong. It&#39;s called &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocity_%28social_psychology%29">reciprocity</a>&quot; in social psychology.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reciprocity in social psychology refers to responding to a positive action with another positive action, rewarding kind actions. As a social construct, reciprocity means that in response to friendly actions, people are frequently much nicer and much more cooperative than predicted by the self-interest model; conversely, in response to hostile actions they are frequently much more nasty and even brutal, even when the initial stimulus was unsolicited</p>

<p>There is no real solution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The key to life is seeing things as they are, not worse or better than they are, otherwise you make decisions based self delusion as your statement suggest you are.</p>

<p>There is no perfect society, it is not attainable in our current state, it has never been attainable, we fail daily now and it&#39;s showing on a global scale with more knowledge than ever before.</p>

<p>Why do you have a problem with science matching up to &quot;original sin&quot;, as you put it?</p>

<p>The science is there and it&#39;s solid, so what&#39;s the matter here...you don&#39;t like the idea of having to answer for yourself to a higher power?</p>

<p>Here, let me really get your goat. You know that quote in my former comment on reciprocity?</p>

<p>This: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reciprocity in social psychology refers to responding to a positive action with another positive action, rewarding kind actions. As a social construct, reciprocity means that in response to friendly actions, people are frequently much nicer and much more cooperative than predicted by the self-interest model; conversely, in response to hostile actions they are frequently much more nasty and even brutal, even when the initial stimulus was unsolicited.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let me show you how far behind you are. Reciprocity is relatively new science in the scheme of things, but is there ANY religious holy books that say the same thing?</p>

<p>Luke 6:38</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Go back to the reciprocity description from Wikipedia and then the verses I gave you from the KJV Bible. They say the exact same thing and I can show you the same in several different faith based books of old including Buddhism. </p>

<p>If you give of yourself or resources to others, others will swarm you with the same and most of the time more, or better in return.</p>

<p>This is just one of hundreds of examples. You may want to educate yourself, not indoctrinate yourself.</p>

<p>I bet you call religious people deluded...right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It matches science, in fact, ahead of science. So, will you cast out science so you don&#39;t have to face reality if it were to come out that you are indeed wrong?</p>

<p>All of the mind sciences (Psychology/Sociology and others) are well over 2 k years behind loads of religious text. </p>

<p>Archaeology is now finding dig sites based on information from biblical text and are finding them accurate. They&#39;ve even validated people from the bible from the digs based on Archaeological evidence alone. King David is a prime example, but not the only king from that era that was identified as valid by evidence from the digs.</p>

<p>Are you saying you would dismiss science?</p>

<p>I am sure I am not going to shoe horn anything. I practice both psychology and sociology on a daily basis in my businesses. I also have several on the payroll and others that are used as consultants.</p>

<p>I play with peoples minds for a living. It&#39;s what I do, so I am pretty sure that I have a very good understanding of these sciences. Likely far superior to your obvious biased view of anything that doesn&#39;t fit your current and self imposed world view.</p>

<p>It&#39;s sad.</p>

<p>Have a great one!</p>

<p>Me too. Perhaps we&#39;re painting with too broad a brush in referring to &quot;the state.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m against the macrostate, but all for the microstate.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also opposed to this new-agey notion that the state is a &quot;necessarily evil&quot; we can do away with altogether. Perhaps some microstates could survive in a near-stateless way, but for the majority of humankind at the present stage of human evolution, the state is necessary and therefore good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>The Deep State by Doug Casey</em></p>

<p>I’d like to address some aspects of the Greater Depression in this essay.</p>

<p>I’m here to tell you that the inevitable became reality in 2008. We’ve had an interlude over the last few years financed by trillions of new currency units.</p>

<p>However, the economic clock on the wall is reading the same time as it was in 2007, and the Black Horsemen of your worst financial nightmares are about to again crash through the doors and end the party. And this time, they won’t be riding children’s ponies, but armored Percherons.</p>

<p>To refresh your memory, let me recount what a depression is.</p>

<p>The best general definition is: A period of time when most people’s standard of living drops significantly. By that definition, the Greater Depression started in 2008, although historians may someday say it began in 1971, when real wages started falling.</p>

<p>It’s also a period of time when distortions and misallocations of capital are liquidated, and when the business cycle, which is caused exclusively by currency debasement, also known as inflation, climaxes. That results in high unemployment, business failures, uncompleted construction, bond defaults, stock market crashes, and the like.</p>

<p>Fortunately, for those who benefit from the status quo, and members of something called the Deep State, the trillions of new currency units delayed the liquidation. But they also ensured it will now happen on a much grander scale.</p>

<p>The Deep State is an extremely powerful network that controls nearly everything around you. You won’t read about it in the news because it controls the news. Politicians won’t talk about it publicly. That would be like a mobster discussing murder and robbery on the 6 o’clock news. You could say the Deep State is hidden, but it’s only hidden in plain sight.</p>

<p>The Deep State is the source of every negative thing that’s happening right now. To survive the coming rough times, it’s essential for you to know what it’s all about.</p>

<h2>The State</h2>

<p>Now, what causes economic problems? With the exception of natural events like fires, floods, and earthquakes, they’re all caused directly and indirectly by the State, through its wars, taxes, regulations, and inflation.</p>

<p>Yes, yes, I know this is an oversimplification, that human nature is really at fault, and the institution of the State is only a mass dramatization of the psychological aberrations and demons that lie within us all. But we don’t have time to go all the way down the rabbit hole, so let’s just talk about the proximate rather than the ultimate causes of the Greater Depression. And here, I want to talk about the nature of the State, in general, and then something called the Deep State, in particular.</p>

<p>A key takeaway, and I emphasize that because I expect it to otherwise bounce off the programmed psyches of most people, is that the very idea of the State itself is poisonous, evil, and intrinsically destructive. But, like so many bad ideas, people have come to assume it’s part of the cosmic firmament, when it’s really just a monstrous scam. It’s a fraud, like your belief that you have a right to free speech because of the First Amendment, or a right to be armed because of the Second Amendment. No, you don’t. The U.S. Constitution is just an arbitrary piece of paper...entirely apart from the fact the whole thing is now just a dead letter. You have a right to free speech and to be armed because they’re necessary parts of being a free person, not because of what a political document says.</p>

<p>Even though the essence of the State is coercion, people have been taught to love and respect it. Most people think of the State in the quaint light of a grade school civics book. They think it has something to do with “We the People” electing a Jimmy Stewart character to represent them. That ideal has always been a pernicious fiction, because it idealizes, sanitizes, and legitimizes an intrinsically evil and destructive institution, which is based on force. As Mao once said, political power comes out of the barrel of a gun. But things have gone far beyond that. We’re now in the Deep State.</p>

<h2>The Deep State</h2>

<p>The concept of the Deep State originated in Turkey, which is appropriate, since it’s the heir to the totally corrupt Byzantine and Ottoman empires. And in the best Byzantine manner, the Deep State has insinuated itself throughout the fabric of what once was America. Its tendrils reach from Washington down to every part of civil society. Like a metastasized cancer, it can no longer be easily eradicated.</p>

<p>I used to joke that there was nothing wrong with Washington that 10 megatons on the capital couldn’t cure. But I don’t say that anymore. Partially because it’s too dangerous, but mainly because it’s now untrue. What’s now needed is 10 megatons on the capital, and four more bursts in a quadrant 10 miles out.</p>

<p>In many ways, Washington models itself after another city with a Deep State, ancient Rome. Here’s how a Victorian freethinker, Winwood Reade, accurately described it:</p>

<p>Rome lived upon its principal till ruin stared it in the face. Industry is the only true source of wealth, and there was no industry in Rome. By day the Ostia road was crowded with carts and muleteers, carrying to the great city the silks and spices of the East, the marble of Asia Minor, the timber of the Atlas, the grain of Africa and Egypt; and the carts brought out nothing but loads of dung. That was their return cargo.</p>

<p>The Deep State controls the political and economic essence of the U.S. This is much more than observing that there’s no real difference between the left and right wings of the Demopublican Party. It’s well known by anyone with any sense (that is, by everybody except the average voter) that although the Republicans say they believe in economic freedom (but don’t), they definitely don’t believe in social freedom. And the Democrats say they believe in social freedom (but don’t), but they definitely don’t believe in economic freedom.</p>

    <div class="md"><h2>Who Is Part of the Deep State?</h2>

<p>The American Deep State is a real, but informal, structure that has arisen to not just profit from, but control, the State.</p>

<p>The Deep State has a life of its own, like the government itself. It’s composed of top-echelon employees of a dozen Praetorian agencies, like the FBI, CIA, and NSA...top generals, admirals, and other military operatives...long-term congressmen and senators...and directors of important regulatory agencies.</p>

<p>But Deep State is much broader than just the government. It includes the heads of major corporations, all of whom are heavily involved in selling to the State and enabling it. That absolutely includes Silicon Valley, although those guys at least have a sense of humor, evidenced by their “Don’t Be Evil” motto. It also includes all the top people in the Fed, and the heads of all the major banks, brokers, and insurers. Add the presidents and many professors at top universities, which act as Deep State recruiting centers...all the top media figures, of course...and many regulars at things like Bohemian Grove and the Council on Foreign Relations. They epitomize the status quo, held together by power, money, and propaganda.</p>

<p>Altogether, I’ll guess these people number a thousand or so. You might analogize the structure of the Deep State with a huge pack of dogs. The people I’ve just described are the top dogs.</p>

<p>But there are hundreds of thousands more who aren’t at the nexus, but who directly depend on them, have considerable clout, and support the Deep State because it supports them. This includes many of the wealthy, especially those who got that way thanks to their State connections...the 1.5 million people who have top secret clearances (that’s a shocking, but accurate, number)... plus top players in organized crime, especially the illegal drug business, little of which would exist without the State. Plus mid-level types in the police and military, corporations, and non-governmental organizations.</p>

<p>These are what you might call the running dogs.</p>

<p>Beyond that are the scores and scores of millions who depend on things remaining the way they are. Like the 50%-plus of Americans who are net recipients of benefits from the State...the 60 million on Social Security...the 66 million on Medicaid...the 50 million on food stamps...the many millions on hundreds of other programs... the 23 million government employees and most of their families. In fact, let’s include the many millions of average Joes and Janes who are just getting by.</p>

<p>You might call this level of people, the vast majority of the population, whipped dogs. They both love and fear their master, they’ll do as they’re told, and they’ll roll over on their backs and wet themselves if confronted by a top dog or running dog who feels they’re out of line. These three types of dogs make up the vast majority of the U.S. population. I trust you aren’t among them. I consider myself a Lone Wolf in this context and hope you are, too. Unfortunately, however, dogs are enemies of wolves, and tend to hunt them down.</p>

<p>The Deep State is destructive, but it’s great for the people in it. And, like any living organism, its prime directive is: Survive! It survives by indoctrinating the fiction that it’s both good and necessary. However, it’s a parasite that promotes the ridiculous notion that everyone can live at the expense of society.</p>

<p>Is it a conspiracy, headed by a man stroking a white cat? I think not. I find it’s hard enough to get a bunch of friends to agree on what movie to see, much less a bunch of power-hungry miscreants bent on running everyone’s lives. But, on the other hand, the top dogs all know each other, went to the same schools, belong to the same clubs, socialize, and, most important, have common interests, values, and philosophies.</p>

<p>The American Deep State rotates around the Washington Beltway. It imports America’s wealth as tax revenue. A lot of that wealth is consumed there by useless mouths. And then, it exports things that reinforce the Deep State, including wars, fiat currency, and destructive policies. This is unsustainable simply because nothing of value comes out of the city.</p>

<p>It’s also a period of time when distortions and misallocations of capital are liquidated, and when the business cycle, <strong>which is caused exclusively by currency debasement.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Stopped reading here, tired of this gold standard circle-jerk. The business cycle is inherent to any marketplace, the only reason that the business cycle has become so violent and volatile is because of the distortion of the marketplace through endless government manipulation of not just our currency but individual markets themselves. The Fed pumping liquidity into the economy is of course complete idiocy, but that doesn&#39;t mean floating currency itself is inherently evil.</p>

<p>Floating currencies were always going to be the inevitable conclusion to the concept of money. The value of gold backed and other commodity based currencies are inherently unstable because the value of those commodities is always changing. You can not tie a certain amount of paper currency to a certain amount of any commodity, and then expect price stability! Commodity-based paper currencies are so obviously flawed I can&#39;t believe people still talk about them.</p>

<p>Floating currencies like bitcoin or the USD are perfectly stable as long as they can&#39;t be manipulated. The American public gave the state the power to manipulate their currency, so that&#39;s where the problem is. The problem is NOT floating currency, it&#39;s government manipulation.</p>

<p>Even if currency laws were entirely repealed, floating currencies (then issued by private financial institutions) would remain the most stable and popular kind of currency. Commodity backed currencies may exist but they would have niche uses in smaller marketplaces.</p>

<p>The universe is self organizing and cyclical in it&#39;s very nature. The business cycle will always exist but that doesn&#39;t mean it is inherently this violent. Theoretically in a perfectly free society each wave of the business cycle would be so subtle that it would appear as if the business cycle had been eliminated.</p>

<p>Ironically the way to eliminate the business cycle is not through CONTROL of the value of currency, but to completely eliminate all controls or interventionist methods in the first place... not just in the value of money but all other marketplace intervention itself.</p>

<p>The answer to ALL our problems is always FREEDOM, and that applies to the value of money and the economy itself. LET MONEY FLOAT, LET IT BE FREE. The god damn Marxists started to take control over the west over 100 years ago now, and that&#39;s why today we have so many problems. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All modern mainstream economic thought is founded on the very same kind of shallow linear thinking that Karl Marx used to reach his conclusions.</p>

<p>In truth, the entire political-economy is still Marxist for there it was Marx who constructed everything upon a basic assumption – government is capable of altering the economic destiny. Nobody has dared to even investigate what if that basic assumption is wrong.</p>

<p>Separating politics from economics has always been a problem. The simple term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_economy">‘political economy’</a> is made up of two words that are so incompatible that they should have been divorced the moment they first met. Hidden within the union of these two thoughts lies the power of government. Politicians run for office promising CHANGE. But can they really alter the course of the economy? Is economics simply masquerading as a science when at most it is a primitive form of just trying to manipulate society?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>K so it seems to me like you don&#39;t really get Marx. Marx wasn&#39;t about using the government to change the economy. He was about workers seizing control of the means of production and self-organizing to democratize production and replace the functions of the state so that it can cease to exist.</p>

<p>in before &quot;central banks are marxist,&quot; too. The concept of a national central bank was hundreds of years old by the time Marx was writing. So was fractional reserve banking. Marx contributed literally nothing to the concept of central banking except to suggest that it could entirely replace private banks and operate for the common good instead of for profit. It&#39;s not even central to any of his actual analysis. It&#39;s just included in a list of basic &quot;after the revolution&quot; promises, along with free education, redistribution of land, etc. The modern concept of an independent central bank is 100% entirely dissimilar to the Marx&#39;s vision of a people&#39;s central bank.</p>

<p>That&#39;d be a self-fullfilling prophecy. But if I had the power to control the media, I wouldn&#39;t want anyone to know that. Doesn&#39;t make any sense to me that they don&#39;t delete a reddit post (wouldn&#39;t be the first post that got deleted <sup><sup>)</sup></sup> about them. Or at least manipulate media articles.</p>

<p>I think saying that theres the one evil network controlling everything and everyone ist just to simple. What&#39;s a fact is that there&#39;s a small amount of people controlling a large one - that&#39;s called modern capitalism.</p>
