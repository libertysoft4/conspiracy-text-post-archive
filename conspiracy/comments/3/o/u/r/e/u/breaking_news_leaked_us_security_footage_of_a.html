        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A recent ‘leaked’ video of what appears to be a UFO coming out of the sea and apparently splitting in two is alleged to belong to the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and has got truth seekers all over the world stating that this is the real deal and could not possibly be anything else. The VIDEO alleged to have been leaked from the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) shows a “UFO being tracked by thermal imaging camera” recently appeared online.The almost 4 minute long video is being taken seriously by UFO and alien researchers all over the world and was placed online by a group calling itself the Scientific Coalition for Ufology (SCU). According to the SCU website, its researchers confirm that the UFO “exhibits characteristics that cannot be explained by any known aircraft or natural phenomenon”. The video was apparently captured by the US ‘Department of Homeland Security’ (DHS) off one of their planes in the sky! This appears to be a very clear video of an unknown object moving in a way like nothing ever seen before!A US Customs and Border Protection Bombardier DHC-8Q200 – Apparently the type of plane that caught the UFO on cameraThe SCU have confirmed that the leaked footage has come from a DHS whistle-blower who does not wish to be named. Apparently since the video has been released by the SCU, quite a few other witnesses have come forward to confirm the sighting.</p>

<p>The SCU apparently spent two years reviewing the footage and building up an in-depth report to confirm the videos authenticity. It has been confirmed that at least 6 scientists and researchers have been named against this project.This UFO incident allegedly started at about 9.20 pm on April 25 2013 at the Rafael Hernandez Airport in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico and was “monitored by the crew of a DHC-8 Turboprop aircraft from US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) – who are part of the US DHS.Please see the interesting video below:The object in the video appears to look like a metallic sphere, which moves fairly quickly over land and then into the ocean and seems to tumble or change shape, almost like the UFO is ‘morphing’ into something different.U.I.P.s friend and supporter of our project, Nick Pope (who formally investigated UFO sightings for the British Ministry of Defence) who sometimes gets a fair bit of criticism for sitting on the fence too often, gave quite a positive response to this footage, he said:“Assuming the video isn’t a clever hoax – which is always a possibility these days – it’s a fascinating piece of footage.”</p>

<p>About the only conventional explanation that might fit the bill is that this is some new drone, but the entry and exit from the sea and the apparent splitting in two of the object makes even this explanation seem unlikely.This is exactly the sort of video that I and intelligence specialists at the MoD got most excited about, as the available data allows for a proper, scientific analysis.I’ll be watching developments on this one with interest.” Nick PopeThe UFO appears to fly with immense control between trees and tall buildings, with knee jerk reactions when racing towards any object in its way! It is hard to tell but the UFO is either joined by another UFO or breaks into two towards the end of the surreal footage.According to one report, the DHC-8 plane had taken off on just a general ‘routine’ flight when they had noticed this strange “pinkish to reddish light over the ocean approaching towards the south.” </p>

<p>Straight away there was a concern on the plane as to why nobody at the tower had “informed them of any incoming traffic “so immediately radioed it in!A USC graphic showing the flight path of the object and craftIt appears that there was much confusion that day. Apparently the tower responded immediately with:“tower told them they also had a visual on the object, but they were unsure of its identity.”The SCU confirmed that an actual flight was delayed due to this UFO hurtling through the sky. It was confirmed that FedEx flight scheduled to leave at 9:10 pm was delayed until 9:26 pm.The SCU has also released details from a Freedom of Information (FOI) Act request response which purportedly shows the DHC-8 took off at 9.16 pm and circled the airport twice before leaving the area after 10 minutes.Please see below video details from the SCU:There were also further details released which confirmed that tower tracked on radar an “unknown object” minutes before the DHC-8 took off which was offshore to the north and north waist of the airport from 8.58pm to 9.14pm.The report stated that The object was between three to five feet in length and its speed varied between approximately 40 mph to 120 mph. Its median speed was roughly 80 mph.” </p>

<p>But the really intriguing part about all this was that It said the object “apparently submerged into the ocean for over half a mile and flew back out.” Something which makes this object appear very ‘Alien’ to this world as there is no ‘known’ technology out there that is capable of this!?It was then stated that the “researchers ruled out a theory the object was a balloon as wind speeds of “eight to 13 mph” at ground level and 12 to 18 mph at 400 to 3,200 feet”, meaning the object “was moving too fast to be carried by wind currents,” plus it seemed to submerge in water. I am pretty sure I have never heard of a balloon act or behave in this manner before!? (return of the ‘weather balloon’ perhaps!?).It was also mentioned that this could have been a type of bird….but, a peregrine falcon’s top speed in stoop was 69 mph, which immediately ‘dismisses’ this idea!It had also been suggested that this could have been some kind of new Navy ‘drone’ called a ‘”flimmer” drone which can fly and dive under water, but has an air speed of 68mph! But immediately it was questioned WHY would such a test go ahead near a civilian airport?! Also the speed of the Flimmer is a lot slower than the top speed the UFO reached too.</p>

<p>The interesting report concluded with:“There is NO explanation for an object capable of traveling under water at over 90 mph with minimal impact as it enters the water, through the air at 120 mph at low altitude through a residential area without navigational lights, and finally to be capable of splitting into two separate objects.“No bird, no balloon, no aircraft, and no known drones have that capability.”Could this ‘unknown object’ of been an Alien Scout type craft?U.I.P SUMMARY – IF this is all completely true and not a hoax story, which from doing our homework this does appear to be very real, this could in fact be one HUGE piece of evidence towards ‘Disclosure’It is not just the way that this UFO manoeuvres into the ocean at such an impressive speed it is the fact that the object appeared to be morphing into ‘different shapes’ whilst being followed on camera, and then eventually appears to break into TWO flying objects!We have heard many stories about unidentified SUBMERGED UFO’s which have been a subject of discussion for sometime in the Ufology arena, but could this possibly be ‘evidence’ off one, caught on camera by the US Government!

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m up voting this for the sheer fact that it contains no political agenda. Nothing about Russia, nothing about Israel and Palestine, or anything to do with world politics. While all that stuff is interesting to read against a conspiracy theme I feel like the more outlandish stuff gets buried to easily by political posts that basically say the same thing. Thank you for posting something different. This was a sight for sore eyes. Bravo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The Russian thing&quot; is a move from Putin to aid Assad in keeping his country his and allowing Russia to keep their biggest ally in the region a float. This move is described by Russian sources as a means to take serious action against Isis which claims American forces have not taken seriously against American claims that they have in fact been dealing with the threat. If you believe that the west is the root of all modern day problems then Russian actions seem to justify a need for change and are acting out against the evil empire that is the west.</p>

<p>It all comes down to who you support or rather who you don&#39;t on the world stage that is causing people to choose sides. Its interesting, sure. I just feel its getting a bit out of hand with the propaganda pouring in from both sides.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They have absolutely not nearly crippled ISIS what so ever and that&#39;s a fucking lie.</p>

<p>They&#39;re doing fine but have not done much damage to ISIS at all, in fact ISIS was making gains as recently as last week because Russia is bombing other rebel groups and ISIS is taking advantage of it.</p>

<p>Iranian troops might fix this problem though.</p>

<p>The US has been pounding ISIS for over a year and killed many times more than Russia has, the difference is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> ignores all of that and spams Russian propaganda to make it seem like ISIS is getting crushed.</p>

None of these birds dive into water, and none of these birds live near the coast. They live mostly in tropics, woods, and tundras. The Golden Eagle can skim the top of rivers for easy fish to catch but doesn&#39;t actually go under. Pelicans don&#39;t fly nearly as fast as the object was flying and birds just simply don&#39;t act that strange. Also, if it was a bird, then it would have slowed down much more drastically when it went underwater. It wasn&#39;t a bird.</p>

<p>Dude, you can&#39;t even talk about that guy on <a href="/r/ufos">/r/ufos</a> anymore. Even those guys are tired of hearing about him.</p>

<p>He saw nothing while in office. Nothing. His interest in UFOs came about from watching <em>a Peter Jennings special</em> after he retired. He has no more knowledge than you or I.</p>

<p>It gives me faith in humanity that they look at a bunch of hoaxers, scammers, and old men telling stories, and do not conclude that the aliens are here, man.</p>

<p>Here is what the entire UFO thing boils down to:</p>

<p>&quot;We saw some shit that looked like it might have been flying, but we don&#39;t really know, and wouldn&#39;t know what it was if it were.&quot;</p>

<p>The end. Everything else is just speculation.</p>

<p>Patently untrue. Most people reduce the level of recording quality to store more footage in the same amount of space.</p>

<p>Now even assuming they have a decent camera and were recording at optimal fidelity, how many of them have the first idea how to operate a camera properly, video or otherwise? Have you seen the average cellphone camera video?</p>

<p>Now take that number of people and divide it by how many of them take the time to actually look into the sky, then take that number and divide it by their chance to be in the presence of an anomalous event in the first place.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a reason most of the compelling evidence comes from the Air Force; they&#39;re in the right places with expensive gear operated by people trained to use it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Probably because most people don&#39;t wander around with DSLR cameras sporting telephoto lenses or thermals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many believe there is a alien civilization living underwater. I myself seen something flying in and out the ocean once. I was in Cape May NJ on the beach watching the sunset with my girlfriend. We both spotted 1 bright light about 5 miles into the ocean. At first we were both sure it was a flare because of the red and orange glow it was giving off and how it just floating up towards the sky. Then things got weird. The 1 single light turned off and then turned back on. At this point we still believed it to be a flare but then 3 more shot up to the sky. They stopped midair, flew back up and then back down to the water. One of them was going to the left and then to the right. At this point we knew flares couldn&#39;t do this. It only lasted about 4 minutes. Just enough for a small crowd to join around us and make us all scratch our heads trying to figure out what the hell it was.</p>

<p>Also I have family in PR and have visited. Lots of UFO activity over there and I have stories for days. Personal experience to stories from my grandma and uncles who lived there all their lives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I want to sort of clarify something about people assuming UFOs are operated by aliens. The reason so many people automatically think aliens is because flying saucers have been sighted since the beginning of time. So these things definitely had to have at least <em>originally</em> been from outer space for obvious reasons. I don&#39;t know why people try <em>so</em> hard to deny that aliens have visited our planet. It&#39;s not that far-fetched. However, I&#39;m not saying that the government doesn&#39;t have secret technology either. I think it&#39;s very possible that governments have reverse-engineered these crafts in secret. Again, UFOs have been sighted since the beginning of time, so aliens are the only the really plausible answer if you look at it <em>historically</em>. Just my contention anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve watched it 5 times now and I don&#39;t think there is evidence that it ever submerged. From the angle, distance and quality the video was taken I can see this flying low and going behind a swell where the angle of the video would make it look submerged because the water in debt is higher. Also I can easily see the quality being so bad that the object just blends in with the background due to loss/compression. </p>

<p>I&#39;m willing to change my ideas just please point me to a spot in the video where it is obvious that it is submerged. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pretty sure we&#39;re seeing a false thermal image throughout the video.  In fact, I think the purpose of the video is to demonstrate this capability (military helicopters project false thermal images too). </p>

<p>The times the drone disappears and the times there are double images are very likely due to the thermal image reflecting off the water.  So it never splits in half.  And it never goes underwater.  And in fact, when it&#39;s near the water it is never where it appears to be at all.</p>

<p>It is almost certainly a military UAV.  Unidentified solely because military research is meant to be kept secret.  </p>

<p>To date, the only time I ever saw something I was absolutely certain was a UFO (in 1987) -- because it seemed like there was no way in hell something shaped like it could fly -- and it sounded like nothing I had ever heard -- well, I learned a few years later that what I had seen was an early <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_F-117_Nighthawk">stealth aircraft.</a> </p>

<p>And the thing in the video?  You&#39;ll know precisely what it is within the next few years. </p>

<p>That was a genuine question I asked you yesterday. Either you don&#39;t know what you are doing, or you are trying to mislead people into thinking you are the author of the articles you don&#39;t even provide a link to. I&#39;m sure you do have more link karma than me since I have hardly posted any topics in the two years I&#39;ve been here, but the fact that you have any link karma at all tells me you <em>do</em> know how reddit works.</p>

Self.posts are for things you your<strong>self</strong> wrote, not for copypasta. If you have an article to post then fucking post it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me re-iterate my first question: You don&#39;t know how reddit works, do you?</p>

<p>Press the button that says Submit New Link. Compose a title. Copy/paste the <strong>link to the article</strong> into the box. Done.</p>

<p>Reddit is a glorified news aggregator, not a BBS forum.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>we here at Noble Savage TV... stand by our posts!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How many extra hits has your site gotten in the last week from people going there to find the source of your copypasta?</p>
