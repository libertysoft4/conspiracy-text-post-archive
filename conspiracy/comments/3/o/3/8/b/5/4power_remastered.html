<p>Did your father (the one who cared &quot;numero uno&quot; about you, unborn) give you that central nerve, or did his father give him that nerve to give to you? How far do you want to go back? His father&#39;s father&#39;s father? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The theory of everything isn&#39;t a &#39;silver bullet&#39;, it&#39;s the ineffable truth.</p>

<p>A theory of everything would be something difficult and eternal... Not something you can lay back and say, &quot;I know it all&quot;.</p>

<p>1, 2, 3, 4 is eternal and difficult, yet we, being wise animals need only 4 to understand almost anything; not academia, which teaches us only 1---which is 1/4 of our total intelligence; and this was through rotary education that in the beginning we all but a few repented. </p>

<p>Remember when you repeatedly wrote down the letter &#39;a&#39; and the rest of the alphabet? That is the foundation to all your knowledge, rather than a wordless central nerve...</p>

<p>We are rote-educated so much it had become a part of us {i.e. a word-virus}, we rote-educate ourselves, our families, and we rote-educate other people---implemented by rotary academia.</p>

<p>Worship of 1, only, equates to anti-1, 2, 3, 4 behaviour.</p>

<p>There is a legitimate need for our species to continue if we want our children to experience life on the planet. This isn&#39;t a planet for adults to have fun, it&#39;s a planet for reproduction and survival.</p>

<p>Academic, math, science, language, are all against this notion. It&#39;s death education that will, and is, leading to the extinction of our species and &#39;hell on Earth&#39; {i.e. a habitat we struggle to live in; world war III approaches; waste product is amounting to a habitat where we are forced to be cannibalistic in; and to infinity}</p>

<p>That statement does apply except you&#39;re referring to academia, whereas I&#39;m referring to the truth.</p>
