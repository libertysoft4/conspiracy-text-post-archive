        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">41</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2015-10-12 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/qaaqa.html">qaaqa</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>You have to remember that because of extremely agressive US policy in the middle east and europe directed by Israeli Neocons like Pearle and Feith driving literally right up to Russias front door in the ukraine , Russia now is in survival mode. They are fighting for their countries existance and independence. They know if ukraine and sryia fall then only russia is left to fall. They want to fight now.  They will fight the US and nato on smSyrians or Ukrianian soil if need be becuase they prefer to do it there rather than in russia.</p>

<p>Thats all fine with tje Israeli Neocons who are quite happe  to destroy US lives to acheive their objectives as they clearly showed by directing the USA into the ill fated invasion and occupation of Iraq to take out Saddam whose was only a threat to Israel.</p>

<p>Israel stopped caring about the USA when the USA stopped greenlighting Israeli occupation of the West bank and called for a palestian state.</p>

<p>If Isreal can get the USA and Russia into a shooting war then the USA will allow Israel to capture all the territory it wants in exchange for Israels help in the middleeast in any combat between the US and Russia.</p>

<p>Also i think putin feels he has a tactical advantage in weaponary now and is trying to show this to the west to discourage them from falling into the Israeli Neocon trap. The Neocons are of course telling the inexperinced Obama he can dominate in order to lure him into a situation with a high likelyhood of escallation.(these people have a huge influence on Obama. They got him elected. Remember Roem Emmanuel was Obamas first Chief of Staff and he was a duel US Israeli citizen and had served in the Israeli military - just think of that for a minute. Where are the president&#39;s advisors true loyalties?)</p>

<p>Putin is trying to stop the invasion of eastern europe and the middle east by the  USA before it reaches Russia (itswhy he brought out the troops in ukraine and grabbed the Crimea buffer zone ) and why he is proping up Assad to hold the russian naval base  there and why he is overdemonstrating all his weapons including the 1500km range cruise missiles he just launched which no one knew he had.</p>

<p>Putin is trying desparately to say to Obama that Obama is being led into a trap of mutualy assured destruction that only Israel will win. Israel is doing it now because it thinks iran will get the bomb and Israel will be done so they care less about the risks now.</p>

<p>What would  be the actual result of a shooting war between russia and the usa starting in the middle east lands? Planes lost. Cruise misiles lost. Maybe a nuke or two in the middle east. Probably a rentention  of current infuence boundries. It woukdnt be a fight to the death.might only last a few days befoee a ceasefire. Would either russia or the us homeland be targeted. Higly doubtful. Afterall russia and the usa have fought before in afghanastan and elsewhere through proxies. They never let it get off the other guys land. They arent stupid.Would Israel launch quick strikes to seize lots of land while the usa snd russia are preoccupied shooting down some planes in syria and nearby. Probably. And then would probably nuke iran too if they felt they could stop them.</p>

<p>Would snyone really care ?  No because both russia and the usa would be glad it stopped in the middleeast and both wohld pull back and the balance of power and bluff would be forever shifted away from internstional adventurism just like after the cuban missile crisis.</p>

<p>Israel would have a lot more land (they wpuld probably go way way beyond current borders of they are going to do this) and would have demonstrated nuclear weapons and eliminated Iran. Leaving them essentally a regional superpower and untouchable.</p>

<p>Israel likely wouldnt be attacked by russia for this like in  normal times becuase russia would be too scared to trigger more with the USA.</p>

<p>What will be the signs Israeli Neocons want this?</p>

<p>Well like before the iraq invasion all the media controlled by israeli neocons would push the fear of russia and demand obama be more agreesive in syria like they are doing now. They would provoke the american publics fears of russia etc like they are doing now. This is actually one of the biggest signs this plan is happening.</p>

<p>Putin is desperately going on all the media he can and being as reasonable as he can to try to encourage the un and the world to stop this. He now has an outlet for his media in RT which is really disrupting the typical total control the neocons had over the media during the raw scaremongering so Putin is able to have more effect. People watch RT are better informed about this.</p>

<p>But for the older americans who only read or listen to mainstream media news they are being led down the path to hate Putin and Russia just like they were with Saddam and Iraq and that only helped Israel.</p>

<p>.so how do we stop it?</p>

<p>Call out an Israeli Neocon every time you see one on TV or in the news trying to rile you up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a hard time understanding the point of your post. But, I am not sure that Israel would want nuked land as it is sorta hard to live on. </p>

<p>So, I can&#39;t really see Israel want Russia and the US to fight in the ME. </p>

<p>Also, it is hard to have a nuclear war with only 1 or 2 nukes. Once they start to fly, all bets are off.</p>

<p>I think that Israel/Jews has been using the US to destabilize countries around Israel. The weaker they are, the better Israel&#39;s situation becomes.</p>

<p>Putin is under attack because he wants to make Russia stronger and the US wants to keep it weak. It is almost a reflex reaction on the part of US/UK at this point. </p>

<p>Both sides suffer from disinfo thru the media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think israel would nuke some hard targetsin iran a dthe us and russia might do a similoar thing.</p>

<p>I dont think anyone woukd use nukes agaisnt us or russian forces becuase that wpuld escallate.</p>

<p>I think we would all be surprised how non plussed the world wod be after a small nuke was used o  a hard target like a bunker of some type.</p>

<p>By the way i am not at all saying anyof this is a reasonable thing.</p>

<p>I am saying ireali neocons have done insane things for what they perceive as their own interests (which i actually beleive will ensure their destruction not save them).  I think this is another insane thing they might be doing. If you listen to Pearle and others speak you see a sort of socipathic misunderstanding of balance  in their thoughts.  Its like the guy who jokes about jumping off a cliff and the guy who constantly stands on the edge with no protective gear.  One is a loudmouth and the other is demented.</p>

<p>Perle and his ilk are demented.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i think basically along these lines, everyone is telling israel no, they cant expand their lebensraum and keep palestinians in a concentration camp but israel would rather have global nuclear war than admit that they arent the real superpower</p>

<p>i sure hope the real americans in the us armed forces and government dont continue to get played</p>

<p>i have tried for a long time to keep israel separat from judaism but i really cant anymore, the jewish people in the united states are cheering this all on. </p>

<p>judaism is a selfish religion that encourages the exploitation and subjugation of others</p>

<p>i have the same to say about christianity and islam, but since the jewish people were already once the oppressed and now use their former oppression as a tool to oppress others, their behavior is beyond</p>

<p>all i know for certain is its risky to say these things and be revealed if you care about your career in the usa, and that the extent of the jewish subversion of the usa is so advanced our entire country may be lost, unless your jewish or like being the pawn in their game.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the reality. In a stable geo-political system, there is no room for aggressive nations to expand themselves, or to dominate their neighbors. Before aggression can be exercised, the system must be destabilized.</p>

<p>Think of it this way. You have a bunch of building blocks and you&#39;ve constructed them into a certain shape. You want to change the shape, but if you take some blocks out, all the others crash down to the floor, because they are interconnected. In order to build something different you must reduce the existing shape to chaos.</p>
