    <div class="md"><p>Ghadaffi&#39;s internationally sanctioned murder is one of the facts about our world that truly pisses me off.  I don&#39;t know if ghadaffi was a good person or not, nor do I give a flying fuck.  </p>

<p>What I do know is that the world governments threw nuclear disarmament out the fucking window when they sanctioned the killing of Ghadaffi.  Ghadaffi, the one nuclear armed leader who actually agreed to hand over his nukes to be disarmed and recycled, which he did and they were recycled in eastern Tennessee within the bounds of the secret city, once home to &quot;the other half&quot; of the Manhattan project.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2004/03/07/AR2005040206017.html">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2004/03/07/AR2005040206017.html</a></p>

<p>Once Ghadaffi was nuke free and we had a chance to show all these other nuclear capable countries what kind of rewards cooperation might bestow upon great progressive leaders... we sanctioned his murder.  We put CIA on the ground to train terrorist how to fight him.  We bombed his conventional army into dust and we assisted in his capture, torture and murder.</p>

<p>Good luck getting anyone else to dump their nukes you short sighted fucking imbeciles.</p>

<p>Furthermore, leading up to the invasion of Libya I frequently expressed how the invasion was a horrible idea, reminded people that ghadaffi had jumped through all the international hoops the UN had asked of him and how Libya was a model country for the region.  I was rewarded with insults and down vote brigades.</p>

<p>Now Libya is a breeding ground for extremists and as soon as they didn&#39;t need our air support to take over the country they burned our embassy and killed our ambassador.</p>

<p>All predictable, all avoidable.  But fear not, we will continue to learn nothing as we lie to our citizens repeating the dogma that we &quot;liberated&quot; Libya.  People will continue to believe it, they will continue to support whatever wars and invasions are suggested by Anderson Cooper&#39;s CIA talking head puppetry.  And we will continue to become less and less relevant as a beacon of democracy.</p>

<p>We may as well knock down the statue of liberty, wrap her up in a burka and send her back to France on a Chinese cargo ship.  We are proper fucked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, we aren&#39;t...</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve noticed or not but there is an organization bigger than any one country that has basically taken over the world.</p>

<p>Nations bow.  USA are the tool of choice because of our money, our technology, our military.  If it wasn&#39;t us being used, it would be a different nation.</p>

<p>I&#39;m an american! i&#39;m USA! the USA is a group of people who ultimately want to be self governed! We don&#39;t want to be propaganda spewing manufactured consent state of warriors.  The people here aren&#39;t that bad and they are sick and tired of the film of slime floating on the surface.</p>

<p>You look at the USA and you don&#39;t see all the wonderful people in her depth, you see only the film of slime and pollution that floats to the surface and chokes out anything beautiful that might try to grow from her depths.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One could argue that they are not short sighted but actually crazy enough to realize that they&#39;re so capable and so stupidly rich they can tolerate any battle/war and beat the other country into submission, cause chaos and accept the &quot;friendly&quot; losses because any conflict will generate cash for the people who treat war like a profit based game. These people would hypothetically want war to be constant and chaotic so that x amount of fighters and x amount of factions are locked in a meaningless, everlasting conflict based off of invisible boogie men and self inflicted violence passed off as evidence of our enemies wrong doing. This is to keep the public in a perpetual state off aggressive paranoia. One could even argue it is the oppressive and hate based wars they start in order to fuel generational racism, profiling and stereotypes that are systematically used against us to divide and conquer each culture on Earth so we can never fully stand up against the true enemies that exploit and murder us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are absolutely right about WMDs. The Libya situation shows that countries should never disarm and know that US policy is to destroy them if they don&#39;t have them. We also destroyed the ability to ever invoke R2P because we abused the UN resolution and went for regime change. 
A huge step back in foreign policy.....</p>
