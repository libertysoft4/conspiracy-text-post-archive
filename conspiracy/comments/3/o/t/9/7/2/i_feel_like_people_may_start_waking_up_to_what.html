        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There are articles popping up regarding the media reaction to the Democratic Debate. Yeah, I know there have been posts on here all day, but I think this is important and needs to be embraced. I&#39;m these articles being shared all over social media, and my 75 year old grandparents have even mentioned how angry and disgusted they are with how the media is acting with Trump and Hillary. Here are a few of the articles I&#39;ve been seeing:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/10/14/cable-news-edits-out-rousing-sanders-attack-on-vapid-media-coverage/">From the Intercept</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.ijreview.com/2015/10/445621-ignore-the-media-pundits-bernie-sanders-won-the-first-democratic-debate/">From the Independent Journal Review</a></li>
<li><a href="http://gawker.com/did-hillary-clinton-win-the-debate-1736498207">From Gawker</a></li>
<li><a href="http://inthesetimes.com/article/18509/anderson-coopers-claim-about-bernie-sanders-soviet-union-honeymoon-was-redb">From In These Times</a></li>
<li><a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/first-democratic-debate-hillary-clinton/">From Nate Silver</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that all of the above links are the best news source or without their own biases, but at least the mainstream media is being called out on their bullshit by some.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t need to be explained here just how bad the propaganda machine is trying to rig the election. The money is flowing into CNN, FOX, and any networks that hold debates. The Corporate Media is the winner here, not The People.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I skim through the online msm articles and read the comments daily.  I rarely see a single positive comment about Hillary.  No one is talking her up or defending her.  The media owners are pushing her, but We The People do not want that thing in our White House.  </p>

<p>Sanders is constantly called out for his socialist views.  Jeb has even less of a foothold than Hillary.  And it seems the only people crowing for Trump are the ill-informed ditto heads.</p>

<p>This whole pre-election process appears to be waking a lot of people to the stranglehold the media owners have over our nation.</p>

I hate to think what a Hillary presidency would mean for this once great nation.</p>

<p>It blows my mind...how can We The People believe that, out of the hundreds of millions of people in this country, this luciferian witch should even be in the running for our leadership?  God damn the media owners.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of non MSM outlets are reporting this. Gawker mentioned it. I don&#39;t know who Gawker&#39;s parent entity is, but it was there. </p>

<p>My friends on social media are also questioning why the polls are disappearing in favor of Bernie and why the MSM is saying Clinton won. I casually point/post photos of poll results on MSM and article titles and let them decide. </p>

<p>Polls say Bernie won, editors publish Hilary won. </p>

<p>The easiest way to convince people they&#39;re being lied to, tell them six entities control what you see and hear for news. They (the MSM) back who they&#39;re banking. They&#39;ll push people into a narrative that paints candidates in a pretty light. If you had your heart set on someone other than the media darling, you&#39;ll be on the losing side. You then feel like you want to be on the winning side so you back who CNN says is winning. </p>

<p>These are generally uninformed/bandwagon voters. I used to be one. I was one with Obama on both elections. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just think this whole thing is a scam to get people invested in actually continuing to support our current iteration of government. Their using very well crafted  psychological tactics to make people angry and feel hopeless by promoting these lies against Bernie sanders so that when they offer there own solution, you accept it. Problem, Reaction, Solution.</p>

<p>Look guys, the best way to deal with its is to walk away from politics and government and start talking amongst yourselves about making a difference in your community. What the system wants is for you to link your energy (by talking,supporting and thinking about their creations) into a system that they can manipulate. 
WAKE UP AND WALK AWAY! just turn around and drop it completely. Dont support it with your money, time and energy. Focus on things you can create or by people that actually want to make a difference. Start talking about them and helping them. Put your energy where it most counts. Some people you can look at stewardship/cooperatives some that I know of are are Dean Clifford&#39;s earthsc.com or Storm Cloud Gathering and his sustainable community. or create your own. Stop supporting systems that we dont control its the single biggest problem right now. If we turn away from these systems we dont control they wont have anybody to support them and these systems will crumble on there own.</p>
