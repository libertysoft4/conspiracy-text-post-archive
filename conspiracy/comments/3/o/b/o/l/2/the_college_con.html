    <div class="md"><p>That goes both ways.  Conservatives love to bash college students as being liberal brainwashed elitists.  I mean.. even this thread is: &quot;aren&#39;t people who go to college really just fuckin retards for not realizing they are wasting their money and enslaving themselves?&quot;  This isn&#39;t a new idea.  This is a common criticism of college and college students/graduates.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bit of a hasty generalization you&#39;re coming to. </p>

<p>There&#39;s not a strong correlation between high school drop-outs and Republicans, in fact they are more likely to vote Democratic. Also, people can be &quot;conservative&quot; and &quot;liberal&quot;, I defiantly am, split down the middle on many issues. Only on the post-graduate level is there a strong link with progressivism. </p>

<p>All comments like yours do is further the divide. Brand conservatives as backwoods uneducated racist, sister-fuckers, and people with college degrees as liberal elitists? LOL nah. Go visit Vanderbilt, Texas A&amp;M, or even ASU. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m talking about people like Rick Santorum who said the President wanting people to go to college makes him a snob and Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity and Bill O&#39;Reilly and Ann Coulter who consistently bring up college to talk about how it&#39;s a bastion of liberal elitist zombies.  You don&#39;t ever see a Democrat in office saying &quot;College is full of brain-dead elitists!&quot;  You can hear Rush Limbaugh or Sean Hannity say that shit anytime they talk about college.  </p>

<p>I have no idea where you are getting this high school drop out shit from?  I never said anything about high school or a correlation between actual intelligence and ideology.  I just said that Conservatives constantly criticize colleges for being &quot;liberal brainwashing echo-chambers&quot; and college students for being &quot;elitists.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No OP, but there are many. Learning a skilled trade, such as welding, HVAC, electrical, plumbing, etc. There&#39;s a huge demand and can&#39;t be outsourced, pay is very good. </p>

<p>Then there&#39;s community college. Plenty of 2 year degrees offered there with high paying employment opportunities such as dental assistant, radiology, etc. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll get downvoted for this, but there&#39;s also the military. Air Force and Navy, lots of technical and computer related jobs that will lead to good civilian employment, and you get college paid for. It is what you make of it, and not for everyone. </p>

<p>edit: IT, product development, jobs. Learn to read code. Companies couldn&#39;t give a fuck in this field, for the most part. If you can read code, and can prove yourself during an interview, you can easily get hired in this field, and earn six figures. </p>

<p>Also, working the oil pipelines doesn&#39;t require any kind of degree, and pays a SHIT ton. Texas, North Dakota, Wyoming, Western Montana are all the hotspots. I have a buddy that got his CDL and went to Odessa Texas with 0 experience, and made over 100k in a year. Very hard work, but they&#39;ll take anyone with a pulse. </p>

<p>That&#39;s key. Ain&#39;t nobody gonna look up if you really graduated from University of Whateverthefuck. Also, I did private classes....they pay MUCH better than schools. Go around to corporate offices and just have chill little convos with rich people in that country who usually already speak english and just want to practice. I made $75 (US) per hr. for a single student....up to $200/hr if it was a group class. Again, people who did the same thing did NOT have college degrees. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Believe it or not a resume/CV is not as important as proving that you can do the job.</p>

<p>Instead of bulking a CV/resume I&#39;d suggest just making stuff. Build webapps, plugins, frameworks, libraries, put stuff on GitHub. Use GitHub as a portfolio to showcase what you can do. </p>

<p>Many programming/dev job requirements now follow suit with what you&#39;d expect of a designer or concept artist: age &amp; experience don&#39;t matter as much as what you can do right now. Obviously experience helps. But if you have no previous work history you can still land a job if you&#39;re capable, trustworthy, and a cordial human being.</p>

<p>An employer just wants to hire someone they know can perform the task without having to worry. Prove that you can write code with real examples and don&#39;t worry as much about the CV.</p>

<p>As far as where to learn, you first need to decide what you want to learn. Do you want to make websites? Mobile apps? Desktop software? </p>

<p>It&#39;s a fairly in-depth subject so check out subs like <a href="/r/learnprogramming">/r/learnprogramming</a> to find out if there&#39;s an area that could be of interest to you.</p>

<p>Recently there was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/3iyd98/cool_interview_with_steven_foote_a_selftaught/">a full interview</a> in <a href="/r/webdev">/r/webdev</a> with a guy who self-taught himself programming &amp; now works as a Sr. Dev at LinkedIn. </p>

<p>I started HTML/CSS/JS/PHP at age 18 and have followed the webdev industry for 6-7 years now. Nobody cares how you learned what you know, they just care that you know it. Luck is a factor and of course a CS degree doesn&#39;t hurt, but is it possible to make this your career without a degree? Myself &amp; many others would say &#39;yes&#39;.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re skeptical then make a post in a programming/webdev subreddit asking for opinions. Although I think if you search you&#39;ll find this question has been asked many times:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1f5011/is_it_possible_to_get_a_job_in_the_web/">1</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/2ricmx/programming_jobs_without_cs_degree/">2</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1rhfga/self_taught_developers_how_did_you_do_it/">3</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/2ricmx/programming_jobs_without_cs_degree/cng6uby">This comment</a> specifically mentions that GitHub pull requests/repos are useful to a potential employer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I have serious problems with the student debt going on in this country (I have a decent amount myself) , there are plenty of people who are better off in life doing something they enjoy/are good at. Even with my debt, I&#39;m in a position where I am pocketing more money than I would be able to make without an education. And yes, don&#39;t get me started on the quality of US education it can be horrendous. Some people really need to do their homework before deciding if they want to go through college, like not taking out debt that will take 10 years of their income from their new job to pay back. As fucked up as the situation is, people need to realize that every diploma that someone earns doesn&#39;t magically create a new job they can walk into. There are a lot of qualified people looking for jobs, no one is going to give you anything just because you have a piece of paper. That said, I do really feel for people that were uniformed/had no guidance going into this debt trap, but you have to look at it as a serious investment into your life, not an &#39;experience&#39; with a huge price tag you can just &#39;pay back later&#39;.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Theory_and_Practice_of_Oligarchical_Collectivism">You&#39;ve never read 1984 by Orwell?</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism, by the character Emmanuel Goldstein, is the fictional book that is used as a thematic and plot element in the dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four (1984), by George Orwell. According to Orwell&#39;s plot, in the totalitarian society of Oceania, ruled by the seemingly omnipotent, omniscient Party, Emmanuel Goldstein (in the Party&#39;s propaganda) is the principal enemy of the state – a former member of the Inner Party – continually conspiring against the leadership of Big Brother. Early in the story, the protagonist thinks to himself: &quot;There were ... whispered stories of a terrible book, a compendium of all the heresies, of which Goldstein was the author and which circulated clandestinely here and there. It was a book without a title. People referred to it, if at all, simply as The Book&quot;.</p>

<p>The biggest problem is our current level of conditioning. Your own mind is going to stop you from looking at this stuff seriously. So it&#39;s going to be very hard to talk about this subject because we are using words that are already corrupted. The term belief is one of them.</p>

<p>I prefer awareness or intuition. So when I look at this information I have an intuiting sense that its true, based on byproducts of these particular systems of control. If a thing is producing and negative outcome, their are reasons behind it. When you look at the core of it you can discover the information yourself, but you have to unlearn what you have learned to get there because our foundation of knowledge is based on deceit. I would start with the hypothetical question. What if everything you have learned is a lie or deceiption to keep you in check and make you into something exploitable? Ask that question and see what you can find. That is the only way I am getting myself out of the mass deception. </p>

<p>So what you have to do is discover the truth for yourself, because nobody is more qualified for that then you are. When you want someone to prove to you if something is either right or wrong, you are not taking responsibility for proving it to yourself.  That&#39;s another control mechanism designed to prevent critical thinking. Your basically taking on someone else&#39;s thought system by allowing them to prove it, and if you believe it, it becomes reality for you without any real thought on your part.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Paying for a college you cant afford is like paying for a car or a house you cant afford. Go to school in your price range folks. Go to community college or don&#39;t go to college at all if you cant afford it. Instead, make as much money as possible to be able to send your kids if you have or are gonna have any. Unless you really enjoy the field you want to go for and money isn&#39;t an issue.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not excusing my country&#39;s insane college prices, just a little tip.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess I mistook your comment, apologies.</p>

<p>It&#39;s kind of ironic you mention O&#39;Reilly, since he is highly educated, with an MA from Boston, MPA from Harvard.</p>

<p>It really pisses me off when such smart people say such stupid shit. They are just pandering to their lowest-denominator when they say that stuff. </p>
