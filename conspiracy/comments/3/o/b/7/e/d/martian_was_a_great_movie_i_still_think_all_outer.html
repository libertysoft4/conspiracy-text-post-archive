<p>Which topics, without poisoning the well of FE bullshit? </p>

<p>Face it, you&#39;ve never been to space, and most likely will never go. So, you cannot be 100% sure of the shit you are spouting. </p>

<p>Now answer the question. Are you in the USAF? I&#39;m a US citizen, and I&#39;m asking you. If you are, remember your oath and answer accordingly. </p>

<p>Edit: It&#39;s suspicious how <a href="/u/rockran">/u/rockran</a> will not answer the simple question (Are you in the USAF?). I know you know your oath, is that why? Pretty damning, mate. Normally, you are soooo quick! You know, like you said, you like to hit &quot;f5&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup. I have no idea of what that place is. Just like I have no idea what Pennsylvania looks like, until I saw it for my own eyes. Relatives grew up there and described it, with bias and imagination. When I visited it, it was nothing of their stories. I perceived it how I saw it. Shitty, red neck, and lonesome, with some beauty. They described it so much different. Your mind is a funny thing, seeing is believing/perceiving....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But surely you believed that Pennsylvania existed and was full of people.  You simply hadn&#39;t been there yourself.  The question is do you limit what you believe to only things you personally have been able to do or seen yourself?  In other words, if you don&#39;t personally get on a space ship and fly to the moon you&#39;ll never believe anybody has?  There is no level of evidence that could convince you outside of a personal experience?  That&#39;s like believing that every time you cover your eyes with your hands the world literally stops existing.     </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I don&#39;t lack philosophy but some questions aren&#39;t philosophical.  If I ask you if Antarctica exists I don&#39;t care about what it means to you.. I&#39;m asking does the physical land of Antarctica geographically reside on the Earth?  Anybody can do the &quot;what does existence truly mean&quot; horse shit.  There is objective reality that is independent of your imagination.  That is what I&#39;m talking about.  If you want to go into a Philosophy 101 class your kinds of answers will be a hit.  I&#39;m talking about Geography 101.  There isn&#39;t an overlap.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not about me being daft.  I am making a point.  You are willing to believe that Antarctica exists and that people have been there even though you personally haven&#39;t been there.  Sure if you go there you might decide it&#39;s colder than you expected or whatever but you still believe that people have been there even though the only evidence you have of that is pictures from government funded excursions.  This is the same exact level of evidence that we have for the moon landing but you summarily dismiss that evidence as bunk and say the moon landing never happened.  By this standard you should also be saying that nobody has ever been to Antarctica either.  </p>

<p>And no.  I&#39;m not any military.  &quot;think before answering.&quot;  What the fuck is that supposed to mean?  Are you going to uncover a conspiracy right here where I&#39;m lying about it?  And I don&#39;t know rockran outside of seeing him post on this thread... but I&#39;m not surprised that yet another conspiracy has arisen in the comment sections of the conspiracy sub.  </p>

I think they are funny.  Not to mention that a lot of those views could be repeat views by the same people.  If you want to prove the earth is curved on your own go buy a weather balloon and put a camera on it and send it up to take pictures.  It will get high enough that with a good camera you will see the curvature of the earth.  You don&#39;t need to rely on NASA or say &quot;that&#39;s a fish eye lens!&quot; on other peoples videos.  You can do this yourself.  Or you can go look at the stars in the Southern Hemisphere compared to the stars in the Northern Hemisphere.  They aren&#39;t the same.

    <div class="md"><p>No I have and it was all bullshit.  It&#39;s super religious people who believe that God made Earth the center of the universe and in the Bible they talk about &quot;corners of the earth&quot; and that can&#39;t be possible if the earth was a globe so some Bible literalists reintroduced the flat earth idea in spite of mountains of evidence to the contrary.  Go buy your weather balloon.  You can debunk this theory in a few hours.  Anybody can.  Why do they ignore that in favor of pushing their agenda?  How is that &quot;seeking the truth?&quot;  It&#39;s willful ignorance.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>you are wrong. I am not religious, and i&#39;ve never even read the bible. the theory is based on math and science. some people have apparently picked up on that it confirms something in the bible but lets agree that happens all the time with the globe model as well and it neither proves nor disproves any theory.  </p>

<p>I can watch all the weather balloon footage I want on youtube - I see what it looks like from high up over and over.  and what it shows confirms flat earth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are using selective youtube videos.  I have shown other &quot;flat earth&quot; people videos and pictures that show the earth curved and they say &quot;that is a fish eye lens in that shot.&quot;  Nobody actually wants to do the research themselves but they want to ignore the evidence that goes against their ideas and embrace the evidence that supports it.  And you might not be religious but you have fallen for a theory that was reintroduced by religious zealots.  They bend the evidence to suit their needs.  Every picture that shows a curved earth &quot;that is fake!&quot; or &quot;that is a fish eye lens!&quot;  But then every picture that shows a straight horizon is called evidence.  </p>

<p>if you want to show the curvature is a result only of reality and not the lens it needs to never flip upwards. the curve should only go one way - find me a video like that and we can talk. </p>

You are content to ignore pictures and videos from other people if they don&#39;t coincide with what you already believe.  If I thought the Earth was flat and I had a way to prove myself right or wrong I would do it.  Hell, it&#39;s the age of the internet.  I would get together with a bunch of likeminded individuals and group-fund my own trip to the &quot;ice wall&quot; that allegedly surrounds the Earth.  You said yourself that millions of people believe this.  Well, if everyone chips in a couple of bucks you could easily fund this sort of exploratory excursion.

Why would they lie about that 500 years ago and still need to keep this lie alive today?

You can travel around the Equator without ever hitting Antarctica.  You can literally start and end at the same point.  If the earth is a sphere that will be possible.  If you attempt to do that and you end up running into an ice shelf you will have proven that the Earth is flat.  Why aren&#39;t Flat Earth explorers doing this?

    <div class="md"><p>yes, you can travel around the equator without ever hitting antarctica, this is what is expected in flat earth theory. imagine taking any standard globe, puncturing a hole in the sound pole - center of antacrtica - and then, pulling that hole so open that you can stretch out the whole map of the earth into a big huge flat circle. like a pizza with an antarctica crust. that&#39;s the idea. you can still travel in a circle east to west and never ever get to the edge just keep going in a circle. the only uncrossed outer perimeter or what could be thought of as the edge of the known world (who knows what lies beyond) is the furthest you can get south - from anyplace on the world. the edge of antarctica. and you are right nobody has crossed antarctica. probably because it is a lot lot lot freaking harder to attempt than we like to think. </p>

<p>Sure you can. Just point your rockets in the right direction and you&#39;ll get moving. </p>

<p>Nope. Newtons third law is key here. It&#39;s like if you use an air compressor - You can feel the recoil when you release the air. That recoil creates motion. </p>

<p>You seem rather confused, I think you could learn a great deal about orbits if you played the game Kerbal Space Program - It has the appearance of a child-like game, but the physics simulations in it are real and would help you see and experiment with space travel. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The moon has no source of locomotion, and yet it stays relatively fixed to it&#39;s orbital path. Explain this.</p>

<p>(I&#39;m going to save you a few burned out brain cells):</p>

<p>The moon (like other satellites) has been given enough lateral motion to achieve centrifugal force capable of overcoming the effects of gravity. Simply, it&#39;s moving fast enough that the motion has a quantifiable effect of preventing it from falling into the planet&#39;s gravity. Technically it is, it&#39;s just the spiral&#39;s actual angle is so low it&#39;s imperceptible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll elaborate: </p>

<p>Whenever someone says slomo accounts for the appearance of low gravity, they tend to ignore the fact that slomo cannot account for other anomalies like low-grav and lack of atmosphere. </p>

<p>If slowmo cannot account for these, then it shouldn&#39;t be used as an argument. </p>

<p>To use it as an argument, is to suggest you&#39;re aware of something to explain away the anomalies (Thus the implication that you know what you&#39;re talking about)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK so explain to me how all 0 gravity video is in real time?</p>

<p>Sure, slow motion recording can give the appearance of staying in &quot;flight&quot; for long periods of time, but explain to me how they get their motions to still seem natural?</p>

<p>Are they just flailing at massive speeds to overcome the time-reducing effect of slomo? No. They&#39;d be obviously reacting to the force required to move their body fast enough to seem like it&#39;s in real time according to Newton&#39;s 2nd law and that would be obvious in the whiplash of moving rapidly.</p>

<p>They did use satellite imagery when looking for MH370 in the ocean. They thought they could use the large areas the satellite covers to search for relatively static debris. As far as using imagery for proving crimes were committed - The satellites are traveling more than 15,000 MPH, and they take images over large areas every couple seconds and stitch them together.

You&#39;d think it would be as valuable and protected as the &quot;Rosetta stone&quot;.... NASA (Never A Straight Answer). Not too mention, they were formed by a bunch of Nazi&#39;s... But I digress.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m talking about the mounted camera before he even jumps.  There are more cameras.  Just buy a weather balloon and do it yourself because you&#39;ll never believe anything until you see it with your own camera.  You won&#39;t do that because you don&#39;t care about the truth.  You are content to ignore pictures and videos from other people if they don&#39;t coincide with what you already believe.  If I thought the Earth was flat and I had a way to prove myself right or wrong I would do it.  Hell, it&#39;s the age of the internet.  I would get together with a bunch of likeminded individuals and group-fund my own trip to the &quot;ice wall&quot; that allegedly surrounds the Earth.  You said yourself that millions of people believe this.  Well, if everyone chips in a couple of bucks you could easily fund this sort of exploratory excursion.  You could literally change world as we know it.  Nobody does it.  You all just say &quot;The government protects the ice wall and will shoot us down if we get near it!&quot;  It&#39;s just a never-ending list of excuses to not do any more than share youtube videos.  </p>

<p>(also... tell your friend to ask Felix if the Earth looked flat from up there)</p>
