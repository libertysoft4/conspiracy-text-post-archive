<p>I was young and alone in my thoughts, but I didn&#39;t believe any of it.</p>

<p>The &quot;official&quot; version of 9/11 turned me into a conspiracy theorist, along with countless others.</p>

<p>Not to go all false dichotomy, but 9/11 liberated some and plunged the rest into a very deep state of cognitive dissonance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like how these alleged terrorists decided it would be a great idea to, on course for the part of the pentagon that would&#39;ve temporarily paralyzed the American air defense and kill loads of important people, decided to pull an 8000 foot descending 290° banked 340 mph corkscrew turn to come exactly level with the ground and hit the Pentagon in the budget analysis office. Pretty big maneuver for a guy who couldn&#39;t even handle a single engine Cesna aircraft.</p>

<p>Cmon White House, you could&#39;ve gotten a bit more creative than that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have exactly the same story.</p>

<p>The fact what makes me a conspiracy theorist now, is that when I grew up I started digging on the story and came up with blatant omissions. The most obvious of these is the fact that when 9/11 was happening me and many others with me weren&#39;t even told by the media that Building 7 came down as well. Which seems like quite a big deal</p>

<p>To this day you can ask any random person in my country (The Netherlands) how many towers fell and 9/10 will say 2 towers fell.</p>

<p>Even to me, who has done relatively little research it is obvious that the 9/11 official story has way too many holes in it to make sense. Any true independent news outlet should be questioning the order of events which they present us which, and would quickly discover many major &#39;coincidences&#39; about the whole event.</p>

<p>Well why hasn&#39;t any major news outlet, in any western country, ever done this?
That&#39;s exactly the question that led me down the rabbithole of power abuse and control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not about &quot;the resources&quot; to leave. Money played no part. Billionaires couldn&#39;t fly on 9/11, since <em>all</em> air travel was shut down.</p>

<p>So it wasn&#39;t about money, regarding the Bin Laden family being flown out. It was about political connections and clout. <em>That&#39;s</em> why it was skeevy.

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s an article on it. It says that they were flown out 2 days later, on September 13, 2001: <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2003/10/saving-the-saudis-200310">http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2003/10/saving-the-saudis-200310</a></p>

<p>According to this source, the rest of the planes in America were grounded for three full days: <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/space/contrail-effect.html">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/space/contrail-effect.html</a></p>

<p>The lead-in to the Vanity Fair article goes: &quot;Just days after 9/11, wealthy Saudi Arabians, including members of the bin Laden family, were whisked out of the U.S. on private jets. No one will admit to clearing the flights, and the passengers weren’t questioned. Did the Bush family’s long relationship with the Saudis help make it happen?&quot;</p>

<p>So, yeah: It would appear that they were flown out while the rest of the nation was still under the flight ban.</p>

<p>Most people can&#39;t believe that any US leaders could be behind it.  They have to believe the official story, because the alternative is too traumatic.  It goes to the root of our beliefs.  Belief in society is crucial to them, as well as it being a matter of pride.  That&#39;s why they sometimes seem to go into almost a blind rage against truthers. They have safety in numbers, and so they can blow truthers off as stupid, continuing to have control.  Society must be what it presents itself to be, it can&#39;t be an illusion because their entire lives are based on it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s psychological, it&#39;s an issue of our need to feel secure.  People can&#39;t handle their beliefs violently crumbling, it&#39;s too traumatic to bear.   But those who aren&#39;t so attached to those beliefs are sometimes open to see what&#39;s going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You may not have heard of Bin Laden much prior to 9/11, but he was a prime terror suspect in the years before and was behind the bombing of two US embassies and the USS Cole. The information to track down the terrorists involved existed prior to 9/11 but it wasn&#39;t complete or shared between agencies. Putting the warnings together immediately after the attacks wasn&#39;t difficult.</p>

<p>And why do you and so many other Truthers claim that the Pentagon is one of the most protected buildings in the world? What armaments does it have? Only one of the sections, as it happened, the section that was struck, actually had the reinforced walls on 9/11. </p>

<p>The Pentagon is a giant office building a mile away from a major airport. It isn&#39;t a fort, it isn&#39;t the Cheyenne Mountain Nuclear Bunker. Planes fly over it all of the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay...the linked book specifically says that they said they didn&#39;t have any Surface to Air capabilities and then basically argues that that doesn&#39;t make any sense, therefore they must have SAMs onsite.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s highly reasonable to conclude, along with Griffin, that the Pentagon was ringed by anti-aircraft installations &quot;programmed to destroy any aircraft entering the Pentagon&#39;s airspace, except for an aircraft with a US military transponder&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s all fine and dandy, except the Pentagon is the headquarters for the US military. As such it is focused on external threats. The US military is meant to identify, engage, and destroy any such threat well before it reaches the Pentagon. It is also <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Pentagon/@38.8635831,-77.0578955,14.61z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x89b7b6df29ed2c27:0xaf83d0f8c013532f">located a mile away</a> from Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, directly beneath the flight path one of their runways (and apparently it also has a KFC and Burger King). Planes fly over it all of the time. Suggesting that it would have a system programmed to destroy any non-military airplane is patently ridiculous.</p>

<p>That&#39;s right. Any argument about the failure to prevent Flight 77 from striking its target should focus on the alleged delay of FAA-NEADS response to the hijacking. </p>

<p>The only politically important building in the United States I&#39;m aware of that had surface-to-air missile batteries equipped was the White House, for a brief period in the Gulf War (IIRC). Even those were removed. </p>

<p>To clarify, the military is focused upon external threats, primarily from other national militaries, and only after 9/11 did it pivot to start addressing stateless insurgents. While they did train for eventualities similar to 9/11, and were actually doing so on that day, the military structure isn&#39;t geared towards a rapid response to a domestic threat. </p>

<p>Had they intercepted flight 11, they probably would have watched it plunge into the WTC from their planned observation position 5 miles back.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Reasonable. The slow response times are a finicky thing to talk about. Some researchers like David Ray Griffin argue that the FAA had protocols in place at the time of 9/11 to co-ordinate with the military to rapidly respond to hijackings. Whether it could respond appropriately, e.g. fighter jets with sidewinder missiles tailing the plane (as opposed to a routine intercept), is another issue. In retrospect, it seems obvious what the military should have done. Which is why some argue that there was a stand down. But it takes time for information to flow and verification to arrive, to escalate and craft an appropriate response. I know it takes a long time to prepare interceptors for a combat-ready state. </p>

<p>In the case of the hijacked airliners, (generally speaking) the time windows to prepare combat-ready fighters are too narrow for a shoot-down response. Possibly Flight 93 could have been shot down, if there were enough time. Not sure about the Pentagon plane -- probably not, because it was hijacked too early for NEADS to respond in time. Plus, it disappeared off the radar for half an hour, so no one could direct fighters to its location. </p>

<p>It&#39;s unlikely Flight 11 would have been prevented, as you said. No one knew that it was a suicide hijacking until it crashed. The protocol at the time had certain outdated assumptions about the nature of hijackings, so its response was influenced by that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is a good one. That bbc broadcast with the tower behind them was stunning. A real glitch in the Matrix.</p>

<p>Also i saw silverstein say he was going to pull the building live in that interview on tv and knew exactly that he meant he was going  to bring it down. Anyone in real estate knows what that means.</p>

<p>But reading Operation Northwoods on an official government server where you clearly see top US government official discussing the options of staging a passenger plane crash to take the country to war made me realize that absolutely no theory , no matter how crazy it had seemed to me before reading that, was off the table.</p>

<p>I still dont know what happeend but i know anything could have happened.</p>

<p>And also seeing that little girl lie to congress about those babies being thrown from the incubators and then learning she was a plant.   And seeing Dick Cheney so obviously trying to push to attack iraq when the weapons inspectors were gaining access and saying there were no weapons of threat to the usa when cheney was running around implying that could nuke us with a mushroom cloud any day.</p>

<p>I have never seen such BLATANT lying before. Ive had seen politiicans lie and wriggle before  but never just obvious blatant bullshit and watching the media go along made you realize the media was cometely part of it too.</p>

<p>And of course seeing thatJeb Bush had signed a document , &quot;The Project for rhe New American Century&quot;, saying essentially that the USA needed a new Pearl Harbor to allow it to expnad around the world.</p>

<p>And all of it coming afterwatching George Bush obviously completely lying about the voting machines in Florida and nobody interesting in examining what had happened and what the real intent of the voters were but rather using that as an excuse to quickly presume the presidency. It was clear that truth and research was not going to be a part of George W Bushcs presidency before he was even sworn in.</p>

Making it a type of false flag, even if unplanned, they certainly took advantage, ran with it, and many, many people died or went insane.</p>

<p>I&#39;m living next to a ptsd vietnam veteran who shot at my other neighbor and went to jail.  I think his life could have been better spent if it weren&#39;t mostly based upon a lie by his government.</p>

<p>At any rate, these are but 2 examples.  Mkultra is a big third.  Government surveillance is fourth--they only admit to doing it when caught.  When you start to investigate, you find so many examples of skullduggery that we are fools to ever trust the government when they say something.</p>

<p>If the government were your friend, would you trust them if you had 10 pages of examples of how they were working directly against your interests in a way that creates moral dread, defies ethical boundaries and unwittingly implicates you in international crimes regarding activities you would never approve based on principles and a general social contract based primarily on judeo-christian ethics (golden rule)?

<p>The XEDS plots for this spherule labeled “Moly sph” show significant concentrations of aluminum, oxygen and

Mo/Al peak height ratio is Mo:Al :: 5:1.)
 We discern that considerable study was performed on this Mo-rich spherule, given the number of images
and XEDS plots for it, yet these data were not previously released in the public USGS reports.[2] We
emphasize these data because of the extremely high melting temperature of molybdenum, and the observation
of this molybdenum-rich spherule. Molybdenum is a refractory metal known for its extremely high melting
point [9]. Mo melts at 2,623 °C (4,753 °F) [10], although addition of other elements may lower the melting
point. No explanation of the high temperature needed to form the observed Mo-rich spherule is given in the

    <div class="md"><p>I kind of felt like it was a controlled demolition from the get go.  I saw that and thought...&#39;so they blew up the building too?&quot;  Then there were fire stories and I never believed them, but I still wanted to trust they knew what they were doing.  Then some time around 2002, my friend showed me pictures taken from the rescue teams of molten steel and I called bullshit on 9/11&#39;s official story then and there, forever.

    <div class="md"><p>I ashamedly admit that in 2002 I was aware of that being said but like all of us at one point before now, I said &quot;Well even though my brain comprehends the basic science principles and laws of physics that apply to this and wow isn&#39;t that something, it&#39;s just too crazy and out there. These crazy people have to have something wrong somewhere. If this were real then everyone would be going crazy and rioting.&quot;</p>

<p>One of the saddest days of my life on this Earth was the day I woke up and realized the &quot;crazy&quot; people were right. </p>

<p>Most shattering to my world view was that no, we Americans would not riot. </p>

<p>Like I said in another post, we as humans tend to think through scenarios in our head through the lens of right now, today, vs say 10/50/100/1000 years ago and how completely different every little nuance of how daily life would have been then. And worse, only able to come to &quot;rational&quot; conclusions based on what our minds have absorbed from existence up until this point and how we are able to imagine things happening in our own &quot;reality&quot;. That&#39;s been further handicapped in its actual realistic representation by having SO little absolute undeniable 100% truth to start with in constructing the whole picture at the foundation. You have to have a break through somehow so you can literally reset your brains hard drive. Build your reality on 100% truth. Question everything else. Everything. I&#39;ve only begun myself, but as heartbreaking as humanity&#39;s real history is, everyone waiting for someone else to care has been and is currently the problem. People don&#39;t need to riot and protest, as much as they need to just see the world as it really is. If that could happen, EVERYTHING would would get better in the end. Sure there is gonna be blood and violence and some really shitty stuff. Can you really draw the line of what you should do as a human being to live in an existence of truth? I mean think about it? Every other species on earth struggles to survive, doesn&#39;t do things to destroy its own existence, and here we are destroying millions of years of nature in blinks of an eye, and were the intelligent beings on this planet? Give me a break. </p>

<p>The relative few psychopaths who run things do not have enough manpower, weapons, or money available to stop a global uprising of billions of people. Once the illusion of states, boundaries,  and the rest goes, how can that ever be stopped. </p>

<p>Knowledge is the most valuable possession. </p>

<p>Only then can we even begin to understand what is happening on planet earth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My aha moment was when I saw molten steel and the swiss cheese cars. The molten steel is scientifically impossible according to jet fuel and office furniture fires.</p>

<p>I studied chemical engineering at a public university.  Numbers matter. The melting point of steel is much higher than was achieved (600F); 2nd law of thermodynamics says heat doesn&#39;t concentrate, it disperses; steel is thermally conductive which means the girders easily dispersed heat throughout the entire building (like fins on your cpu heatsink) faster than the heat would have been able to accumulate and melt, were the heat sufficient which it wasn&#39;t; and heat of fusion (additional heat requirement to &#39;melt&#39; or change state of material from solid to liquid) was unmet in this fire because it was calculated to be around 600F for 40 minutes tops; a cooler fire because of insufficient oxygen supply clearly seen by thick clouds of black smoke emanating from the fires.  </p>

<p>Even with full oxygen supply, it would have only achieved at the most 1500F which is far below 2600F needed to melt steel.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the case of the missing joules.  </p>

<p>They replaced joules with fools...and likewise stole our hearts and minds.  They committed a crime.</p>

To them, the lives lost on 9/11 were necessary sacrifices to achieve larger geopolitical goals. They knew their history and that false flag events had been used successfully in the past, and to their great joy, it worked again. The delusional Cheney, Bush and their cohorts should be rotting in jail cells for mass murder, yet they are treated as political &quot;wise men&quot; by the media, allowed to spew their revisionist history with very little push back. Only with an objective, well-funded fresh inquiry into the events of 9/11 will justice ever be served, and I&#39;m not holding my breath for that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Naturally not. As far as I can tell, it hasn&#39;t been released. I&#39;m going based upon the article you linked which didn&#39;t support your assertion, and some quick searches after you mentioned it&#39;s actual title.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>NSPD-9, prepared for the president&#39;s signature just days before September 11, is a tricky document for the Bush administration. For one thing, as the 9/11 Commission reported, its principal author was current White House enemy Richard Clarke. This led administration officials last week to contort themselves explaining how their bin Laden strategy was somehow more &quot;comprehensive&quot; than the one Clarke proposed in January 2001. (Clarke has said there are only cosmetic differences between his January 2001 plans and what came to be known as NSPD-9.) What&#39;s more, when the administration has tried to explain those differences, it has tended to resort to what 9/11 Commissioners Jamie Gorelick and Bob Kerrey have implied are falsehoods. Chief among these is the assertion that NSPD-9 contained a significant military component--an idea that appears in Ruff&#39;s talking points. </p>

<p>Ruff scribbled that NSPD-9 &quot;called on to draw up targets in Afg develop military options.&quot; The public hasn&#39;t seen NSPD-9. But as Gorelick has described it, the document&#39;s principal military element was to &quot;look for ways to oust the Taliban based upon individuals on the ground other than ourselves, at the same time making military contingency plans.&quot; That almost surely means that the administration intended to rely on Northern Alliance proxies to fight Al Qaeda and the Taliban, while our own forces would be limited to planning for, in Gorelick&#39;s words, &quot;contingenc&quot;--that is, military engagement in only exceptional situations. Indeed, Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage told the Commission that direct U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan was envisioned only &quot;after the horror of 9/11.&quot; <a href="http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&amp;amp;address=103x42843">here</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And <a href="https://fas.org/irp/offdocs/nspd/nspd-9.htm">here</a>.</p>

<p>Neither of which imply that they had preplanned the Afghan invasion, and both of which, plus your guardian article, seem to indicate that they weren&#39;t seeking direct involvement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was 18 during 9/11. Thought nothing of it (conspiracy-wise). A year or two later, I was online with a bunch of friends. (Before streaming media was really a thing) I had the news on next to my desk, and they announced that they were finally going to &quot;debunk&quot; all those conspiracy theorists by releasing the video of the pentagon being hit. I told people online and they all turned on the news. We watched. Extremely low quality images, pathetic 2-3 FPS, and nothing followed by a magical explosion.</p>

<p>I sat in disbelief. I shook my head. Thought to myself &quot;did I blink in the exact moment the plane entered the frame?&quot;. I asked if anyone else online saw a plane. They all said no. CNN repeated the video a minute later. We all watched. Still, no plane at all.</p>

<p>Then it hit me, like a ton of bricks straight to the face. How could I be so stupid? How could I not have thought to ask this ONE question about the pentagon attack before?</p>

<p>Fuck the single low quality camera footage. IT&#39;S THE FUCKING PENTAGON. WHERE THE FUCK ARE THE OTHER CAMERA FEEDS?</p>

<p>No government agency that important has a single low quality camera feed outside. They have tons of cameras. So where were the rest? Where were the different angles?</p>

<p>After researching the &quot;official report&quot; and finding out that the government said 80+ cameras that would have caught the pentagon attack SIMULTANEOUSLY MALFUNCTIONED and only that single camera survived set off every bullshit alarm in my head at once.</p>

<p>It was a truly, genuine &quot;holy shit&quot; moment in my life. Realizing how big the lie is, and how many people believed it.</p>

<p>That started my journey. I have since spent the last 12 years or so doing heavy research into everything I could. I ended up lucky. As big is the global scam of everything is, and as non-existent as hope can be sometimes, my mind is able to push on and remain stable. I can still socialize, have fun, crack jokes, while simultaneously continuing my research. Most other people I know got burnt out. The scope of everything overwhelmed them and they shut down and stopped caring.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most interesting. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1999, Helms says, she got a message from the Taliban leadership that they were willing to turn over all of bin Laden’s communications equipment, which they had seized, to the U.S. When she called the State Department with this offer, officials were at first interested, but later said, “No. We want him.”</p>

<p>In the same year, Prince Turki, head of Saudi intelligence, reputedly came up with a scheme to capture bin Laden on his own; after consulting with the Taliban he flew his private plane to Kabul and drove out to see Mullah Omar at his HQ. The two men sat down, as Helms recounts the story, and the Saudi said, “There’s just one little thing. Will you kill bin Laden before you put him on the plane?” Mullah Omar called for a bucket of cold water. As the Saudi delegation fidgeted, he took off his turban, splashed water on his head, and then washed his hands before sitting back down. “You know why I asked for the cold water?” he asked Turki. “What you just said made my blood boil.”</p>

<p>Bin Laden was a guest of the Afghanis and there was no way they were going to kill him, though they might turn him over for a trial. But that the deal collapsed, and Turki flew home empty-handed.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was an accumulation of evidence against the official story that turned me against it, but it was the footage of WTC7 collapsing that got me started. It was so clearly a perfectly executed controlled demolition, but I was taken aback by how officials and &quot;conspiracy debunkers&quot; either ignored this event, or fought hard to deny it was a CD. They would tell you that when Silverstein said they decided to &quot;pull it&quot;, he really didn&#39;t mean take the building out. They would tell you it was perfectly normal that a fire would take down a 47 story building in less than 10 seconds. In short, they would tell you that an orange was really an apple, and I just wasn&#39;t buying it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was when I watched a documentary called smartest guys in the room. It detailed the enron scandal and its far reaching corruption involving the California rolling black outs. That changed everything for me. How this ties into 9/11 is that when 18 year old me heard about the Patriot act the very first thought that went through my head was &quot;this takes away American ability to have a revolution if things ever got bad&quot;  but dismissed it. 18 year old me wasn&#39;t there yet. Then when I saw that documentary some switch went and for some reason my thouggts returned to the patriot act and my first reaction. I slowly began to embrace my inner skeptic.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard and seen so many people telling television crews how the planes that struck the WTC were unmarked, plain grey planes that looked like Air Force refueling planes. Or the countless firefighters saying explosions went off while they were inside. The famous scene you guys probably remember is of the two firefighters covered in debris and blood sitting outside discussing this. No scripts, just pure unbelieve of what they witnessed. They hadn&#39;t a clue what was going on, all they knew was that explosions occurred.</p>

<p>Than you have the actors who for some reason know a lot more. Like the crisis actor seen all over the news, who proclaimed right after the collapse how such intense heat would destabilize the internal structure enough for it too collapse in such a way. </p>

<p>&quot;The aluminium industry has reported more than 250 aluminium-water explosions since 1980. Alcoa Aluminium carried out an experiment under controlled conditions, in which 20 kilos of aluminium smelt were allowed to react with 20 kilos of water, to which some rust was added. The explosion destroyed the entire laboratory and left a crater 30 metres in diameter.&quot;</p>

<p>Please avoid propagating disinfo. Check the validity of extraordinary claims against other sources. Aluminum is just simply not that reactive. Most industrial aluminum accidents are steam explosions. Under the right conditions, could it blow out windows? Yes. Could it destroy a building&#39;s infrastructure? Almost certainly not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I simply was asking what the person thought of it.  I hadn&#39;t looked into it yet, and after doing so, I admit that it seems like that paper is disinformation.  But I also disagree that this is common chemical knowledge, especially when talking about such large amounts of aluminum alloys, rust and water as the researcher suggests.  There might never have been such an experiment performed which calculates the force of such a &quot;steam explosion&quot; as suggested by you.</p>

<p>So you claim there were never any craters 30 meters in diameter in these supposed experiments by Alcoa?  What were they caused by?  Why even admit there was such a crater if it didn&#39;t exist?  Also you have to remember that the amount of molten aluminum might have been a few tons.  And thinking about this more, taking the non conspiratorial view, it might possibly explain the explosions heard by people on ground floors: steam explosions.  I know that many use this as evidence of demolition.  But this adds to the complexity of the scene; and just after looking int</p>

<p>I&#39;d hope you understand Dimitri&#39;s claims (It seems you do) before you attack him.  Have you read his book?  Skimmed it?  Why so offended?  Because he has an air of certainty and pompous ego?   Is that truly a good reason to dismiss someones claims?  It might make it harder, but claims are claims.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty well corroborated by eyewitnesses that explosions took place on the subterranean levels of WTC 1, 2, and 7 before they fell. But nukes? I mean, maybe. Maybe the nanothermite just couldn&#39;t cut it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m on the fence on nukes, though I&#39;m not on the fence about Dimitri. I trust KGB no more than I trust CIA or Mossad.</p>

<p>Either way, the aluminum is pure bullshit. Somebody was generous with their use of the word &quot;crater&quot; or else they were lying. Aluminum isn&#39;t violent with water. Water is violent with heat, but steam explosions could only move earth if they were contained by something much denser on all other sides.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These are form that article I posted above</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;You want to make sure you&#39;re not perching something on a ledge,&quot; said Anthony Pontecorvo, a supervising structural engineer at Mueser Rutledge Consulting Engineers, which is working on the project.  </p>

<p>But the reminders of the power of glaciers won&#39;t be around for long. The pothole and other features are being covered, filled in or blasted away.  </p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s nice to look at, but it&#39;s all got to go,&quot; said Robert B. Reina, a supervising structural engineer at Mueser Rutledge.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>These quotes just make me go &quot;Huh?&quot;  Apparently, tremendous skyscrapers were initially built on them just fine.  Now we are finally &quot;discovering&quot; them?  Given that the evidence is now definitely destroyed, I am insanely curious whether or not these were glaciers.  Dimitri goes into the theory behind both nukes and (nano)thermite and uses extreme logic to weigh the possibility of both, alongside the official story of course, which he certainly gives zero credence.   </p>

<p>I don&#39;t trust anyone.  I can evaluate the claims of individuals, and their motives for making such claims.  The latter is harder to distinguish than the prior always.  The former is what Dimitri calls elementary logic all too many times.  Hes very pompous and sometimes insulting, but I have to admit, there is a level of logic he presents which is refreshing.  We all know the buildings collapses top down.  For nanothermite to &quot;cut it&quot; it would have had to be planted in way to many locations to be feasible.  He discusses basic calculations such as weight of material that needs to be brought into the building.  And number of steel support structures/column in the entire building.  </p>

<p>The three quotes below are from <a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/arch/core.html">http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/arch/core.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>the outside of each tower was covered by a frame of 14-inch-wide steel columns; the centers of the steel columns were 40 inches apart.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The exact dimensions of the outside steel H-beams: steel, two inches thick, 36 inches long and 12 inches wide.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The core columns were steel box-columns that were continuous for their entire height, going from their bedrock anchors in the sub-basements to near the towers&#39; tops, where they transitioned to H-beams. Apparently the box columns, more than 1000 feet long, were built as the towers rose by welding together sections several stories tall</p>

<p>Like the perimeter columns -- and like steel columns in all tall buildings -- the thickness of the steel in the core columns tapered from bottom to top. Near the bottoms of the towers the steel was four inches thick, whereas near the tops it may have been as little as 1/4th inch thick. The top figure in the illustration to the right is a cross-section of one of the smaller core columns from about half-way up a tower, where the steel was about two inches thick. The bottom figure shows the base of one of the larger core columns, where the steel was five inches thick. The bases of the columns also had slabs of steel running through their centers, making them almost solid.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The amount (and weight) of energy stored and released by nanothermite to destroy all of this is astronomical.  How do you suppose it was planted?  When?  </p>

<p>Dimitri claims he has inside information which basically goes like this:  many if not all large skyscrapers have built in demolition to take them down, since buildings do not last forever.  He says explicitly that he knows the twin towers had such devices, in addition to the WTC7 building.  For such large skyscrapers, you&#39;d imagine it&#39;d be forward thinking to have a plan to destroy it in the safest way possible (straight down collapse, as seen on TV.)  The cluster of buildings that fell on 9/11 were special in that demolition engineers decided to go with underground nuclear bombs, which were calculated to direct most of their energy straight through the central core of the buildings.   </p>

<p>These would not be megatons or hundreds of kilotons of atomic energy, but enough to superheat/melt/dustify the building and bring it straight down on itself.   Furthermore, the physics of underground nuclear explosions are not what the general public thinks (&quot;Impossible! How could a nuclear bomb be exploded in the heart of manhattan?!?&quot;) .  It&#39;s quite common to know that nukes are exploded high above the ground to do the most damage.  What happens when one explodes underneath 100 feet of rock and granite? Where the only pressure release is the central core of a skyscraper...?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>for me it was while watching loose change 3rd edition. a friend recommend it but didn&#39;t even know what it was - it was basically a mistake that I watched it. at first I was like this looks kinda boring and depressing - but it was the math about free fall. the physics of how fast the buildings fell - when they discussed that I knew that was evidence there were explosives used. and when they went into how the 9/11 commission denied there were explosives used but also did not test for them ----- my whole body/mind would never be the same because I knew then and there 9/11 was literally an inside job and our government was complicit. </p>

<p>a lot of research since then got me somewhat closer to the why and how though not all the way, but it was that first understand that there was no way to negate the proof our government was literally hiding/ denying the existence the real murder weapon/plot used to kill thousands of it&#39;s own people - that was my aha moment. </p>

<p>but on reflection I should have figured it out when they found pristine passports of hijackers on the rubble from twin towers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I originally bought the official story.  It sounded good.  They worked the sentiments well.  I was all about waving the flag and getting some payback for the people that were killed.</p>

<p>Then I started to have doubts.  I believe firefighters.  When a firefighter with nothing to gain or lose tells me that there were explosions, I trust them.  There started to several of those.  I started to look closer.</p>

<p>At some point, although it was guilt-inducing (I&#39;m a patriotic American and I support the troops, etc...), I started to think, &quot;This whole thing might be bullshit.&quot;  So I started looking hard.</p>

<p>Then I saw the hole in the Pentagon.  That was it.  I knew that part of it WAS bullshit, and if that was, the rest was highly suspect.  I have no idea how much of it, but I do know that a certain percentage of the official story about what happened on 911 is a total load of crap.  Once I accepted that as a fact, there was no going back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was obviously a psych op by noon that day based on the unfolding media coverage and the fact that defense for the Pentagon had stood down.   </p>

<p>The second tower had been &quot;hit&quot; 9:03 by Flight 175.   The Pentagon then &quot;hit&quot; at  9:37 by Flight 77.</p>

<p>That is the most highly defended building on the planet and they had 34 minutes to scramble to defend the capital after the second &quot;hit&quot; in NYC.</p>

<p>This meant that the US was going to war.    The rest of the day played into the war plans.    The American people had gone into total shock.</p>

<p>Since that time,  there has been a deeper appreciation,  year by year of hundreds of questions that show that the official story has been a fabricated lie.     I think the anthrax issue is way under appreciated.    Of course the demolitions.    Of course the ensuing decade of war.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Over a thousand bodies were vaporized on 9/11 in NYC,  never even found DNA.    And then they found firefighter bone fragments on rooftops that required lateral ejection,   hundreds of feet away.</p>

<p>The official story does not account for explosions other than the initial fireball.    There were no firefighters there at that time.</p>

<p>We saw a lot of explosion(s) in addition to the initial ones.</p>

<p>If the collapse was caused by fire,   it would have been a collapse,   and the material on the ground would have been more similar to an earthquake collapse.    As it was,   the pulverization exceeded the collapse explanations.</p>

<p>In other words,   what we saw on video that day,   dust clouds and debris wise,   was surreal and did not match the tv dialogue.    When survivors and body counts never materialized,   when hospital wards and morgues did not fill to overflowing,   the story got more and more surreal.    People don&#39;t vaporize in a collapse to that degree.</p>

<p>The Saudi BinLaden Group is the world&#39;s second largest construction company. Contracting repeatedly with a successful architect does not a conspiracy make.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The passport was recovered by NYPD Detective Yuk H. Chin from a male passerby in a business suit,
about 30 years old. The passerby left before being identified, while debris was falling from WTC 2. The
tower collapsed shortly thereafter. The detective then gave the passport to the FBI on 9/11. See FBI report,

<p>The key here is that these arguments are based on <em>strange</em> coincidences. Yes, it is strange that the architect of the WTC &quot;regularly&quot; contracted with the BinLaden group. Until you actually look at his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_works_by_Minoru_Yamasaki">career</a> (<a href="http://yamasaki-inc.com/saudi_monetary.html?m5#markets">or his website</a>), where we see that he is an international architect who has buildings in Japan, China, India, Saudi Arabia, and throughout the US. He&#39;s designed Synagogues, so now he has connections to the Zionists, One Government Center in Toledo, so obviously he&#39;s an operative for the NWO, buildings for the Air Force, so he&#39;s a part of the Military Industrial Complex, <em>and</em> two Federal Reserve Banks, so he has ties to the financial sector! Who else might have been involved in 9/11!? </p>

<p>Or, maybe, just maybe, he&#39;s a world renowned architect with a large portfolio who was commissioned to design several projects in Saudi Arabia where the predominant construction company is the BinLaden group, the world&#39;s second largest construction company, and there isn&#39;t actually a nefarious connection.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re going to present evidence, it probably shouldn&#39;t be redacted to the point of being useless with the one portion not redacted directly contradicting your claim:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Team lacks access to the full range of investigative materials in FBI possession and is therefore unable to either concur or dissent on those points. In addition, <strong>the Team encountered no evidence that the Saudi Government knowingly and willingly supported al-Qa’ida terrorists.</strong> Individuals in both the Near East Division (NE) and the Counterterrorist Center [REDACTED] told the Team they had not seen any reliable reporting confirming Saudi Government involvement with and financial support for terrorism prior to 9/11, <strong>although a few also speculated that dissident sympathizers within the government may have aided al-Qa’ida.</strong> </p>

<p>And perhaps you&#39;ll dismiss the multiple conflicting origin stories of this &quot;miracle passport&quot;.

<p>Ok, there are two conflicting accounts, one from 7 days after the attacks, one during the actual investigation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I still think it was a random terrorist attack. Horrific, hard hitting and visually the worst thing I&#39;ve ever witnessed. We try and rationalise that random people are not capable of such destructive atrocities and therefore create this whole huge government conspiracy theory. Nah. Some souless people on this earth flew planes into buildings in a misguided holy war terrorist manoeuvre. The world suffered the worst string of subsequent events and  the buildings toppled. Yes the government laws and responses have been shitty but the event wasn&#39;t scripted and premeditated in order to change the course of history and our dominated futures. Just wouldn&#39;t happen on that scale.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was 16 when I saw the events of 9/11 on the TV. I did not have a particularly critical worldview at the time and I didn&#39;t think much about what I was seeing and hearing. Some three years later, I came across some 9/11 truth stuff by sheer chance, and, though the material I saw wasn&#39;t particularly noteworthy in itself, it did inspire me to legitimately evaluate the events for the first time in my life. Immediately upon evaluating the information I already had, it became unmistakably clear that the events were staged. It wasn&#39;t any sketchy detail in particular - it was just a realization that the story I had assumed was true was impossible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I simply was asking what the person thought of it.  I hadn&#39;t looked into it yet, and after doing so, I admit that it seems like that paper is disinformation.  But I also disagree that this is common chemical knowledge, especially when talking about such large amounts of aluminum alloys, rust and water as the researcher suggests.  There might never have been such an experiment performed which calculates the force of such a &quot;steam explosion&quot; as suggested by you.</p>

<p>So you claim there were never any craters 30 meters in diameter in these supposed experiments by Alcoa?  What were they caused by?  Why even admit there was such a crater if it didn&#39;t exist?  Also you have to remember that the amount of molten aluminum might have been a few tons.  And thinking about this more, taking the non conspiratorial view, it might possibly explain the explosions heard by people on ground floors: steam explosions.  I know that many use this as evidence of demolition.  But this adds to the complexity of the scene; and just after looking int</p>

<p>I&#39;d hope you understand Dimitri&#39;s claims (It seems you do) before you attack him.  Have you read his book?  Skimmed it?  Why so offended?  Because he has an air of certainty and pompous ego?   Is that truly a good reason to dismiss someones claims?  It might make it harder, but claims are claims.</p>

<p>On that note, have you ever seen the picture of the &quot;glacial structures&quot; beneath the WTC dustified remains?  </p>
