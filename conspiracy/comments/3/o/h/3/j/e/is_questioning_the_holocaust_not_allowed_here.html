I responded to a holocaust post once, and a few days later made an unrelated comment on an unrelated post in r/christianity, and some dumbfuck responded with, &quot;Hey everyone, this guy&#39;s a holocaust denier!,&quot; or some shit like that, in an attempt to undermine what I had said.  I didn&#39;t mind because it gave me the opportunity to show the redditors on <a href="/r/christianity">/r/christianity</a> the reasons we should all question the &quot;official&quot; holocaust lie, but it just goes to show how they work.

    <div class="md"><p>I visited Dachau. I saw a lot that was evidence of a real camp, and real ovens. very scary and sad, I took tons of photos. I have no doubt people were hearded from their lives and forced to live in horrible captivity. </p>

<p>but later when i researched i realized that the claims were that those ovens could burn hundreds of people in a day, and that they were designed for mass killing, they could not do that.  i only remember seeing about 4 ovens but maybe there were more and other&#39;s had been destroyed. but there was no area set aside for many of them, not that they showed us. and each oven was only big enough to fit one person in long way - and not even an obese person. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what that means -- they had ovens there for sure. there was cremation going on at Dachau for sure. but the speed at which they claim the mass numbers were burned doesn&#39;t make sense given what I saw. - for what it&#39;s worth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the allies originally tried to say Dachau was a death camp with operating gas chambers.  That was proven to be bullshit so they changed the story to saying that the camp had gas chambers that were never used.  There is a lot of propaganda surrounding the holocaust so it&#39;s hard to know what actually happened where.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a logistical problem, burning a human body takes a lot of resources and time. I too have been to concentration camps, I know they were terrible and I feel bad for anyone who ended up there. </p>

<p>But the logistics of the Holocaust do not support the claimed numbers. </p>

<p>But really, that&#39;s all beside the point. WWII caused the deaths of more than 50 million people, and ruined the lives of tens of millions more. Even accepting 6 million jews died, why are they the only group that gets sympathy? Why does that give them carte Blanche to commit genocide and ethnic cleansing in Palestine? </p>

<p>Holocaust &quot;denial&quot;, like climate change &quot;denial&quot; are psychological word games to disrupt the possibility of discourse and rational debate. No one denies that climate is changing, or that people died in the Holocaust. What people debate are the specifics, and in a world of political correctness there are certain topics determined to be undebatable which in a &#39;free world&#39; is an atrocity in and of itself. </p>

<p>and when I figured out about 9/11 I looked into some other &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; like moon landing and eventually boston bombing, staged shootings even flat earth. but Holocaust fell off limits  by my own personal standards. </p>

<p>then finally I looked into it, and to my dismay saw  - yes there are tons of lies about it. A Lot of people died horrifically, the general horror is not all a lie by a long shot. but specific accounts, esp about the gas chambers, were propaganda for sure. </p>

<p>Levin&#39;s lawsuit was about who had the rights to produce a <em>play</em> from the book. He never claimed to have written the book.</p>

<p>What would that have to do with the Holocaust, anyway? I&#39;ve never heard anybody dispute that Anne Frank died of disease in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp.</p>

Jan. 9, 1958</p>

<p>Meyer Levin Wins $50,000 Over Play</p>

<p>Jury Grants Award Against Producer of ‘Anne Frank’ and Girl&#39;s Father</p>

<p>A Supreme Court jury early this morning awarded Meyer Levin, author-playwright, $50,000 in damages in his suit over the play &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Levin had sought $600,00 from Kermit Bloomgard, producer of the play, and from Otto Frank, the father of Anne Frank, the young girl who had kepth the diary before dying in a Nazi concentration coamp.</p>

<p>Mr. Levin had contended that he had conceived the idea of turning the girl&#39;s diary into a play and had adapted it for the stage. A change of producer and writers resulted in his being defrauded of his rights, he charged.</p>

<p>The play was produced in 1955. As it appeared on Broadway, written by Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett, it was judged by the critics as one of the most distinguished plays in recent years. It won the New York Drama Critics&#39; Circle Award as the best play of the year 1955 and the Pulitzer Prize.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as I know there&#39;s no rules against it as long as it&#39;s not based in racism, ie saying Jews are inherently evil or something to that effect. The religious theories kind of push the limit of hate speech when they say stuff like Jews are demons or reptilians, worhsip Satan, etc, but those are hard to lump in with garden variety antisemitism. If you truly believe those things it&#39;s no longer about race or hatred, you&#39;re talking about religion, or in the case of reptilians cosmological problems since reptilians aren&#39;t a race and true Jewish humans in those theories aren&#39;t considered any better or worse than anyone else. Questioning whether or not the story we have been beaten over the head with since birth is entirely accurate, if not an actual lie or planned/staged event shouldn&#39;t e against the rules, since the primary purpose of the sub is to question the &quot;official narrative&quot;. However, any question of this topic will be met with a knee jerk reaction to cry racism at the mention of the idea that the story isn&#39;t 100% true as told by the media, despite not mentioning anything anti-semitic, and the peewee mossad volunteers will crash down on the thread with all the fury of the most impotent SJW white knight cavalry. Oh by the way I&#39;m sure you/we&#39;re on a list in a database somewhere for even mentioning this topic, but probably were before anyways (Hell I&#39;d be surpised if half the sub weren&#39;t on a list for their search queries). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it has something to do with acquirement of Nazi scientific knowledge gained from the horrible experiments conducted on prisoners. Sure they were fucked up, but the Allied forces weren&#39;t gonna pass up an opportunity to gain more knowledge. So perhaps by designating the camps that were freed by them as work camps, and not solely for death, they were able to  smuggle some of the more important scientists out of prosecution in exchange for information. </p>

<p>Also the Nazis believed the Slavs should be exterminated, so thats probably why there were more death camps over there.</p>
