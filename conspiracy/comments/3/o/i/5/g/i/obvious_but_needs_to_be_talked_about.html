    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Almost every single diabetic seems to be on anti depressants, or another drug to help regulate mood. High anxiety etc. This is painfully obvious. Can anyone confirm this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Probably due to body image issues and diabetics on average being overweight. Depression and body image issues would likely be your causal link. The diabetes is either from the lifestyle that leads to being overweight and thusly to body issues, or the diabetes is a symptom due to eating from depression. Lots of confounding factors here. </p>

<p>By the way:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Everybody is taught the Pineal gland is to regulate mood in school right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. It&#39;s not solely for mood regulation, nor is that taught in schools. Your mood is mediated by the entirety of your endocrine system. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, I found it funny Reddit doesnt recognize Pineal gland as a word lol.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Probably because Reddit uses the common dictionary, not a medical dictionary where the proper names for various glands would be contained.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;sugar free&quot; is a lie. if it&#39;s not aspartame, it&#39;ll be &#39;something&#39; else.</p>

<p>tried a new bottled water that comes in different &quot;fruit&quot; flavors, claims it&#39;s <em>sugar free</em>. </p>

<p>but it taste sweet, checked the label &amp; it contains sucralose, had to look it up.</p>

<p>&quot;Purity is something everyone is striving for. The FDA claims that sucralose is 98 percent pure, but what about the other 2 percent? It contains heavy metals like lead, arsenic, triphenilphosphine oxide, methanol, chlorinated disaccharides, and other potentially dangerous substances.</p>

<p>One study on sucralose showed an increase in glycosylated hemoglobin (meaning damage to the oxygen carrying part of a red blood cell). Research in animals has shown:</p>

<p>Up to 40 percent shrinkage of the thymus gland. (Critical for the response to disease – the ‘heart’ of our immune system)</p>

<p>Enlarged liver and kidneys</p>

<p>Atrophy of lymph follicles</p>

<p>Reduced growth rate</p>

<p>In my opinion, not enough long-term research has been conducted on sucralose to establish its safety for human consumption. I feel our government should evaluate the use of natural substances such as stevia or lo Han fruit for use as a non-caloric sweetener. I am sure their safety would prove to be excellent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Accurate, furthermore everything you ingest falls into a bath of gastric acid... there is something to what he says though, it&#39;s called Vincent Bioelectronic, it&#39;s old science that has been put under the rug by capital. Two years in and it seems to be working (granted it&#39;s anecdotal evidence, although i converted quite a few people hehe)... The short of it is that germs have requirements, with two parameters: proton and electron availability in the tissues. Proton availability is the pH, viruses and bacteria do better in slightly alkalin environment, however there is the electron requirement, the environment needs to be oxydizing for viruses, and reducing for bacteria. At both other end of the spectrum lie algae (reducing and acidic) and fungus (oxidyzing and acidic). If you stay in the middle of both the protonic and electronic scale (by drinking lots of pure water, less than 100ppm mineral salts), your immune system will have no problems fighting off germs, and you will effectively never get sick. If you don&#39;t stay in the middle, you open the door to infections. Chlorine in drinking water does a fantastic job against bacterias, but it makes us prone to viral infections...</p>

<p>That&#39;s not accurate unfortunately. Chlorine is used in water as it is to kill bacteria, viruses, and parasites. We use chlorine because it does such a great job at stripping cell molecules of electrons due to the high electronegativity of chlorine ions, thereby breaking down the structure of the bacteria or viruses. Viruses are especially susceptible to chlorine as they have no nuclear coating protecting their DNA from the outside world. The CDC has a great chart on it <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/safewater/effectiveness-on-pathogens.html">here.</a></p>

<p>Nutremia happens due to an overabundance of &#39;pure&#39; water in your system, forcing nutrients and electrolytes out of your cells. It will kill you. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s a matter of volume. Bacteria and viruses are smaller than a cell, so a few chlorine ions kill them pretty well. Meanwhile, us larger, multi-cellular life don&#39;t mind losing a few hundred cells. Most of the chlorine outgasses when the water leaves your tap anyway. That&#39;s why we use aerators on faucet heads.</p>

<p>Have a blood sample taken, read the pH. Then drink a glass of orange juice and do it again. The result will be the same. Enjoy your pudding.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the energy necessary to keep your body at the same PH comes from somewhere - if you tax that energy too much you get sick.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It comes from the breakdown of the molecular bonds of the food you eat and the resulting oxidation of sugars from the same food. You&#39;re not taxing anything. If your body needs energy, it will generate the sensation of hunger, you&#39;ll eat more food, and problem solved. Homeostatis... look into it. We&#39;re not bacteria, subject to the pH of their local environment. We&#39;re large scale multicellular chemical reactions given form. We&#39;re more robust than your hypothesis implies.</p>

<p>edit:</p>

<p>Of note, and not previously mentioned by myself, the primary way your body removes acidity from it is through your lungs and breath. CO2 exhalation is the main acid reduction mechanism for your blood, with your kidneys and urine being secondary.</p>

<p>Nope.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Believable and possible, but that would mean the treatment worked, not necessarily this alkaline diet nonsense. What exactly was the change in diet? If he was slamming down pizza and beer every day, then any dietary change would have been for the better. </p>

<p>You&#39;re attempting to speak against all of established biomedical science. If you&#39;re going to make the claim, you&#39;re going to have to provide extraordinary amounts of verifiable evidence, not your anecdotal and possibly non-existent friend&#39;s story. </p>

<p>For not believing your unevidenced statements about things that just aren&#39;t true, I&#39;m the bad person? Ad hom much?</p>

<p>I typically don&#39;t classify falsities as &#39;greater&#39;.</p>

<p>That wouldn&#39;t be what I did. I assumed your story isn&#39;t to be believed because you have all of biomedical science in one corner, and your weak, unsupported anecdote in the other. I wouldn&#39;t bet on glass Joe.</p>
