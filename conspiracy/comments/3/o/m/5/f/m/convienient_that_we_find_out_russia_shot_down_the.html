    <div class="md"><p>There were no bullet holes, the only people claiming that don&#39;t know how these missiles work.</p>

<p>They blow up and spray the plane with shrapnel.</p>

<p>The video this article is talking about clearly shows what caused the damage and how it was caused.</p>

<p>The missile blew up next to the cockpit ripping it apart with shrapnel like a shot gun blast.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That isn&#39;t really true, a BUK just blows up by proximity and can hit anywhere on the plane for the most part.</p>

<p>This BUK blew up to the side of the cockpit and the people that made the missile already did showed that.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DmraSOdTYk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DmraSOdTYk</a></p>

<p>The reason they tend to hit the cockpit like this is because it instantly kills the pilots while at the same ripping the plane apart.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ok, but im pretty sure even an air to air missile will do the same kind of damage. but you have to ask, if someone intentionally did this, who benefits from it? i highly doubt russia would, they dont need any more bad publicity as it is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually an air to air missile wouldn&#39;t do anywhere near this damage.</p>

<p>The missile that hit the plane was a BUK beyond a reasonable doubt, and it was fired from an area controlled by Russian rebels.</p>

<p>Nobody is saying Russia did it or wanted the plane shot down at all.</p>

<p>People are saying Russia gave advanced AA systems to crazy ass rebels for some unknown reason and they made a mistake.</p>

<p>This is why Russia is so desperate to cover this up.</p>

<p>One rule of a proxy war is you NEVER give AA weapons like this to rebels, ever.</p>

<p>The US gave rebels stingers which have a max range of about 13.5k feet, a civilian airplane cruises around 35k feet.</p>

<p>The BUK system Russia gave these rebels has a max range of 80 THOUSAND FEET.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I literally just explained this to you and you didn&#39;t read it.</p>

<p>Nobody said they WANTED to shoot it down, they thought they were shooting down a military transport plane and you can see that by how they tweeted bragging about shooting down a military transport within 5 mins of the civilian flight being shot down.</p>

<p>They then deleted the tweets shortly after.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what I&#39;m saying to you.</p>

<p>Russia said it was  BUK missile.</p>

<p>The company that manufactures and designed the BUK missile said it was a BUK missile.</p>

<p>NATO said it was a BUK missile.</p>

<p>The dutch said it was  BUK missile.</p>

<p>There is absolutely nobody in this scenario that believes it was anything other than a BUK missile.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then show me these tweets. If it was an accident, why didnt they immediately apologize and clear up any misunderstandings?

    <div class="md"><p>Because the fucking plane was flying out of range of most AA weapons, like most people they assumed Russia wouldn&#39;t arm crazy ass rebels with advanced AA weapons.</p>

<p>Why didn&#39;t they apologize? because they had just fucking shot down a civilian airliner with Russian made AA weapons in a proxy war.</p>

<p>Why on earth would they ever admit guilt? there was also no Ukrainian SU-25 seen climbing anywhere.</p>

<p>On top of this why would an SU-25 be at 33 thousand feet?</p>

<p>You realize the max altitude of an SU-25 is around 16000 feet with weapons it&#39;s about 23 thousand feet.</p>

<p>So do tell, if the plane was at 33 thousand feet how did a ground attack plane with a max range of 23 thousand feet shoot it down?</p>

<p>The SU-25 as a ground attack aircraft only carries <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-60_(missile)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-60_(missile)</a> as an air to air missile, it has a 6 pound warhead and isn&#39;t at all capable of doing this much damage. </p>

<p>It&#39;s only effective against light aircraft.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Air_Lines_Flight_902">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Air_Lines_Flight_902</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s a civilian airliner that was hit by an r-60 and made a landing 40 minutes later, the missile doesn&#39;t do anywhere near enough damage to bring down a modern civilian airliner.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2014/07/17/pro_russia_rebels_deleted_social_media_posts_on_downing_plane.html">http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2014/07/17/pro_russia_rebels_deleted_social_media_posts_on_downing_plane.html</a></p>

<p>Do you see why the story that an SU-25 had anything to do with this is absolutely insane? how can you just believe something like that without checking any of the specs on the plane/the weapons it uses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>so why should russia or BUK be punished? i am certain russia did not give them the weapons so they could shoot down airliners. and it was either an Su-25 or MiG-29. anyways, if we could hear the ATC recordings it would clear up alot of confusion, but for some reason that has not been released.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why should Russia be punished for supplying rebels with advanced AA weapons capable of shooting down civilian airliners? did you really just ask that question?</p>

<p>And no, the conspiracy was that it was an SU-25 not a mig-29, and nobody would have seen a mig-29 climbing.</p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing to clear up, Russia armed rebels with advanced AA weapons and they shot down a civilian plane.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t being debated by anyone, these are the facts of the this case.</p>

<p>Russia is just trying to spin conspiracy theories to do damage control, you can bet your ass had the US armed rebels with patriots and they shot down a civilian plane this subreddit would be going nuts calling the US the worst country on the planet.</p>

<p>But Russia does the exact same thing and you guys just refuse to accept it and claim it&#39;s a conspiracy.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter why you give them weapons, you don&#39;t fucking give rebels BUK missile systems with a max range of 80 thousand feet. You just don&#39;t.</p>

<p>The US didn&#39;t even do this during the afghan war for this very reason.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve answered every question you&#39;ve asked, every single one.</p>

<p>You have not refuted anything I&#39;ve said at all and just keep saying &quot;what if&quot; over and over.</p>

<p>We literally where exactly where the missile came from, and there is a video of the BUK missile in a convoy going back to Russia after the shooting.</p>

<p>There needn&#39;t be any ATC recordings because we know why they flew over, because they were at 33k feet outside of AA range after rerouting to avoid a storm.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, Ukraine managed to sneak a BUK missile system into rebel controlled space, then fabricate a thunder storm out of thin air causing the plane to reroute.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>first of all, how do you know that this supposed video is actually that same buk system? and how do you know it was going back into russia? and what i meant was not that ukraine sneaked a missile system into rebel controlled space, but that they deliberately told the plane to fly over rebel space to be shot down by the pro russian rebels (assuming they already had a buk there).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because you can match the serial numbers/markings on the side.</p>

<p>Second, no that isn&#39;t true at all. </p>

<p>The plane was always flying over Ukraine, it rerouted to avoid a thunderstorm that was happening.</p>

<p>So Unless they were capable of fabricating a storm out of thin air, and then knowing that the rebels would fire at a civilian airliner this theory is stupid.</p>

<p>This is really weird to me, even when confronted with overwhelming evidence that you&#39;re wrong you still think it&#39;s some conspiracy and not Russia.</p>

<p>This is the definition of brainwashing, Russia is amazing at this.</p>

<p>They literally got video evidence of a BUK missile system moving to Russia 3 hours after the downing of the plane with a missing missile.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d hardly call it the exact same thing. First, Ukraine&#39;s lawful government was ousted in a putsch, arguably backed or at least supported by the West.

<p>Second, Ukraine is directly on the border of Russia. It is in their direct national security interest to ensure the safety of their border.

<p>Have you seen Netflix&#39;s <a href="http://youtu.be/RibAQHeDia8">new documentary  <em>Winter on Fire</em>?</a> Watch that, then tell me the people of Ukraine didn&#39;t want to be Westernized.

<blockquote>

<p>The people of Ukraine voted for a Western friendly president, period.  Russia didn&#39;t like this,  but Ukrainians overwhelmingly did.  This again,  was the will of the people of Ukraine,  and the president was elected legitimately,  hence the rioting and demonstrations ending.  </p>

<p>This is a red herring.  If this is the case,  Syria is on the border of Israel, and wouldn&#39;t you say the same thing,  that Israel has a direct national security interest to ensure the safety of their border? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>They don&#39;t so much want to overthrow the government in Kiev </p>

<p>When you send mercenaries into a sovereign country,  of course you want to overthrow the government.  This was Israel and Russia&#39;s plan from the very beginning in Ukraine and Syria. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve have not seen it, yet I have no doubt that many, likely a majority, wanted Yanukovych gone. However the manner in which it was done was shady to say the least. Remember the protestors and police being shot by the same snipers, or Victoria Nuland saying she wanted Yatsenyuk for PM, who got the job after Yanukovych&#39;s ouster?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The protestors were largely Western Ukrainian, hence why the rioting in <em>Kiev</em> stopped; they got what they wanted. The conflict in Eastern Ukraine then started because they felt their government had been overthrown. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If this is the case, Syria is on the border of Israel, and wouldn&#39;t you say the same thing, that Israel has a direct national security interest to ensure the safety of their border?</p>

<p>If the Syrian government had ever been a threat to Israel maybe. Having a caliphate or a failed state on their border would be a much greater threat to Israel than Assad ever was. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>When you send mercenaries into a sovereign country, of course you want to overthrow the government.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or we could take the Eastern Ukrainian separatists at their word, that they want to secede from Ukraine. This obviously benefits Russia which is why they support it. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying Russia is a saint in Ukraine, but to equate it&#39;s role their to the US role in Syria is just laughable.</p>

<p>And no, the conspiracy was that it was an SU-25 not a mig-29, and nobody would have seen a mig-29 climbing.</p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing to clear up, Russia armed rebels with advanced AA weapons and they shot down a civilian plane.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t being debated by anyone, these are the facts of the this case.</p>

<p>Russia is just trying to spin conspiracy theories to do damage control, you can bet your ass had the US armed rebels with patriots and they shot down a civilian plane this subreddit would be going nuts calling the US the worst country on the planet.</p>

<p>But Russia does the exact same thing and you guys just refuse to accept it and claim it&#39;s a conspiracy.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter why you give them weapons, you don&#39;t fucking give rebels BUK missile systems with a max range of 80 thousand feet. You just don&#39;t.</p>
