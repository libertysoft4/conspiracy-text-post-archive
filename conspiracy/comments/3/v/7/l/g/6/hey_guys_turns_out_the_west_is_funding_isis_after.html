<p>Hey.  At least you had steam to begin with.  Lots of people haven&#39;t even <em>picked up</em> steam to inform people.  It is what it is.  We just have to gather as much information as we can - first and foremost and primarily for <em>ourselves</em>, so that WE can be informed and educated, and then if anyone else asks or wants to know? then we can pass on the information we gained and inform them as well.</p>

<p>Some (sometimes many) of these people will not accept the information.  All good.  That&#39;s on them.  Give it to them anyway.  Tell them what you know, and then move on regardless of whether they accept it or not.</p>

<p>Just have a &quot;meh&quot; attitude toward whether they accept it or not regardless.  Easier said than done, but that&#39;s what I tend to do.</p>

<p>Yeah.  Really, at the end of the day, all this information we gather and learn about is for <em>us</em>.  It&#39;s for us educating <em>ourselves</em>.</p>

<p>You can only lead a horse to water.  You can&#39;t make it drink.  The drinking it must do on its own.</p>

<p>All we can do is educate ourselves as much as possible, and present the water to others who are thirsty.  If they refuse to quench their own thirst, let them continue on in their lives then - wandering about, gasping for air, wondering why they&#39;re so horribly thirsty all the time and everything around them seems so damn dry.  Oh well.  Not your problem.  You give information, and then just move on, drinking and quenching your own thirst.</p>

<p>Exactly this.  This is very important.</p>

<p>Very correct, sir.  Very correct indeed.  Don&#39;t attach yourself too much if at all to the final outcome of the information you disseminate.  Just disseminate it, give the knowledge, answer whatever questions some might have, and then simply move on.</p>

<p>Sometimes much easier said than done, but this is what we all most work toward doing all the time nonetheless.  Agreed and correct, sir.</p>

<p>Yep.  Totally.  I must remind myself of my <em>own</em> words as well.  Sometimes things devolve into an attempt at just being “the right one” regardless of what is said.  I try not to do that, but sometimes it’s not easy if you can feel that the other person is coming into the conversation from a place of general negativity and is there more to hurt, belittle, and marginalize <em>you</em> personally than gain knowledge and learn information.</p>

<p>If you see something, say something! The media isn&#39;t going to do it for us.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t mean to be preachy, but this is serious fucking business. Hundreds of thousands of people will die, if the Iraq war was any indication. Wars hinge on public opinion, and if no one is contradicting the media narrative, then guess who then owns public opinion? Going to war for profit is a snap if no one ever speaks out against it!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think the US arms Turkey directly, I was unable to find information supporting that. More that Turkey has NATO as a fallback, and NATO is armed by the US. This link shows that, &quot;NATO will help Turkey against Russia if needed&quot;: </p>

<p>But it also seems the government is paid by the US to look the other way about certain things. There is a lot of dirty money going around with the Turkish government, just read about the almost billion dollar palace President Erdogan built on what was supposed to be a national park. The guy is clearly corrupt as all get out:

<p>NATO support of Turkey after the ISIS link comes out, siding with ISIS supporters rather than admit Russia is right.

    <div class="md"><p>My theory on the oil thing is that it&#39;s a way to punish russia and Iran, who both heavily rely on oil exports as a source of income. It&#39;s a way to collapse their economies. OPEC sets the price of oil, it has very little to do with actual demand or supply, because the supply amounts are chosen by OPEC to ensure they get the prices they want, that&#39;s why there is $50 oil, imo. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who buys saudi oil, thus giving them funds? Who gives them a few billion a year in military funding, with which they MUST buy US manufactured arms? The US. </p>

<p>Where does the ISIS oil go? Through turkey. Why is NATO defending Turkey after they shot down a Russian jet that was in their airspace for 17 seconds? Why do they want Turkey to join nato more than ever? So they can overthrow Assad and put in their own Syrian government. </p>

<p>It&#39;s clear the west backs ISIS, and it&#39;s clear the US and Israel are the military spearheads of the western governments.</p>

<p>Who has the most interest in overthrowing Syria, which is also the goal of ISIS? Israel. They&#39;re right there, geographically. They want to expand in to greater Israel, which is the core of the ideology of Zionism, which involves taking over Syria. </p>
