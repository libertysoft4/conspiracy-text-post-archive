<p>i already have my own issues with a lot of the incidents weve been fed by the media but this one takes the cake for me. people simply standing around and a school that started active shooter drills with a prepped and ready swat team nearby? come on... </p>

I like to think the truth lies somewhere in between every educated and informed opinion of what events occurred. Then I get to this sub and I try to take it seriously but I just see a lot of people being as ridiculous and agenda pushing as any news outlet is. Not every time something bad happens is the government behind it. Why is it only that the people I knew who grew up to be total losers are the ones who are so adamant about the government doing these horrible things? They&#39;re not happy with where they are and they want someone to blame for it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m simply sharing information and links that others are posting and talking about, which isn&#39;t the official narrative.

<p>I never once said that.  You&#39;re putting words in my mouth.  You however tow the official line in almost every one of your comments.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s exactly what I&#39;m doing actually.  I&#39;m sharing information from like minded people.  I&#39;m not attempting to &quot;brainwash&quot; anyone into thinking how I think, I leave that up to other people to decide what they want to do with the information I&#39;m presenting to them.</p>

<p>Ok, well since you won&#39;t, I&#39;ll do it for you.  There&#39;s 21 videos already posted with people saying this hoax, less then 2 hours after the start of it.  It&#39;s not just me who thinks this way Bob.  There&#39;s still room on the bus for you too if you want to jump on :-)</p>

<p>Dear Bob,</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure I understand why you&#39;re here. I like you, actually. You&#39;re pretty witty sometimes. And you do manage to call out bullshit sometimes. But all you seem to do is attack people who post regularly on this sub. It seems that&#39;s all you do here. I&#39;ve been here nearly a year, and I don&#39;t actually see posts from you which indicate that you care at all about this sub being hurt. I usually see your user name attached to a comment that is negative. Someone says something, you say something to the effect of &quot;Bullshit&quot;. Maybe it&#39;s your style. Either way, I would love to know why you come here. If you&#39;re not up to answering that, that&#39;s OK. I just thought I&#39;d ask.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve said it ten times here. I typically, 99.9% of the time, comment on stuff I think is bullshit and disagree with.

<p>As we speak they&#39;re showing what seems to be a shootout on a street with these suspects, but it&#39;ll be called fake simply because it happened.  </p>

<p>Yeah, that&#39;s definitely your style. That&#39;s what I was implying. Your posture is negative in that someone says something, and you disagree. I definitely get that.</p>

<p>You never hop into &quot;OMG False flag&quot;. In fact, I don&#39;t think you actually believe they have ever occurred in a modern context.</p>

<p>The thread already calling out a &quot;crisis actor&quot; because he&#39;s wearing a baseball cap?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, I know how you feel. Saw that one too. It&#39;s ridiculous, but I just ignore it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s so dumb I have a hard time taking other &#39;iron clad proof&#39; seriously when it comes from people who argue both with equal sincerity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think that&#39;s the idea. When people toss out such easily dismiss-able nonsense like the cap, of course you&#39;re going to think, &quot;These people are fucked&quot;. It&#39;s called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisoning_the_well">poisoning the well</a>, and it&#39;s very effective. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>... is a rhetorical device where adverse information about a target is preemptively presented to an audience, with the intention of discrediting or ridiculing everything that the target person is about to say. Poisoning the well can be a special case of argumentum ad hominem...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And yes, a nugget of proof is possible, and &quot;deluded fools&quot; exist, but people also come here in the aftermath of events to poison the well. Many, many people come here who don&#39;t usually, some for legit reasons, some to confound, troll, and obfuscate discussions. I&#39;ve seen quite a few of those here today. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been here for nearly a year. And when I say &quot;here&quot;, I mean both reddit and this sub. This gives me a certain advantage in that I&#39;m beginning to see through a lot of the stuff that goes on here. So many posts from people who never post, and those posts are usually the posts that try to make the sub look bad. </p>

<p>People will often say, &quot;You&#39;re deluded if you think anyone cares what anyone says on this sub.&quot; I have to disagree. Reddit in its entirety is a battleground and a nest of shills. We know there are paid shills on reddit. That&#39;s hardly in dispute, and discrediting the one sub where people tend to take a position of dissent from standard narratives has to be of some importance to those who wish to maintain and reinforce official narratives. And honestly, it really doesn&#39;t take much. A few users on a single sub with at least one or two as mods is probably all it takes. I can&#39;t imagine it costs very much either.</p>

<p>Yeah, that&#39;s definitely your style. That&#39;s what I was implying. Your posture is negative in that someone says something, and you disagree. I definitely get that.</p>

<p>You never hop into &quot;OMG False flag&quot;. In fact, I don&#39;t think you actually believe they have ever occurred in a modern context.</p>

<p>Just curious. What are great sources in your books?</p>
