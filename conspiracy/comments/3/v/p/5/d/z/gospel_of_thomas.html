<p>Jesus said &quot;When you make the two into one, and then when you make the inside like the outside and the outside like the inside, and the upper like the lower, and thus make the male and the female the same, so that the male isn’t male and the female isn’t female. When you make an eye replace an eye, and a hand to replace a hand, and a foot to replace a foot, and an image to replace an image, then you will enter the Kingdom.&quot;</p>

<p>What is the two that needs to be made into one?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s both a metaphor for consciousness and the union of opposites – but also a reference to finding &quot;immortality&quot; (entering the kingdom) through cloning and genetic engineering. We can build eyes in pitri dishes now; we&#39;ve mapped the human genome. So, imagine, if you will, that we can duplicate a person who has just died; all that&#39;s lacking is being able to store his/her neural pathways at the time of death, and that person can be &quot;re-fashioned.&quot; The two that needs to made into one is absolutely anything that is currently represented by the Tao – male/female, good/evil, light/dark, etc. We are evolving into beings that will have a singular consciousness, and the dualities will no longer need to exist.</p>

<p>When the vision inside reflects the vision outside, and the vision outside reflects the vision inside; you have entered the kingdom.  Is my &#39;kingdom&#39; (vision) the same as yours?  Probably not, but they both exist within the Infinite itself.  There seem to be many paths to the same destination.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Imagine a copper penny that is exactly like an ordinary
penny except that for this discussion it has consciousness. It
knows it is a coin and it knows that you sometimes flip it.
And it knows that no external force dictates whether it
comes up heads or tails on any individual flip.</p>

<p>If the penny’s consciousness were like human consciousness,
it would analyze the situation and conclude that it
had free will. When it wanted to come up heads, and heads
was the result, the penny would confirm its belief in its power
to choose. When it came up tails instead, it would blame its
own lack of commitment, or assume God had a hand in it.</p>

<p>The imaginary coin would believe that things don’t
just ‘happen’ without causes. If nothing external controlled the results of the flips, a reasonable penny would assume
that the control came from its own will, influenced perhaps
by God’s will, assuming it were a religious penny.</p>

<p>The penny’s belief in its own role would be wrong, but the
penny’s belief in God’s role would be right. Probability—the
essence of God’s power—dictates that the penny must sometimes
come up tails even when the penny chooses to be heads.</p>

<p>The scientific principle states that any specific cause, no
matter how complex, must have a specific effect. Therefore,
we believe two realities that cannot both be true. If one is
true, the other must be false.</p>

Most people identify with the physical form and reside fully in the material world.
People see separateness between &quot;self&quot; and everything else. That is living in the illusion of duality.
There is no separation. Beyond the illusion of form and physical matter, it is all one single, whole.
You can reside in physical form and live in the physical world, but at the same time not deriving your identity in the dense plane of physicality.
&quot;Be in the world, but not of the world.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally I smoke a lot of weed. But I also meditate. If you have trouble meditating I recommend picking up a hand skill like drawing , calligraphy or sculpting or really anything that allows you to realize you are not a body you are a radio wave of consciousness. Sometimes drugs like psychedelic mushrooms can be used to shake off our ego and see the world more clearly. The earth has provided everything we need to help us learn and grow.</p>

Is that the reason the term for magic has never been able to evolve beyond the supposed childlike dogma that&#39;s been applied to to it( thanks Harry Potter) but is in actuality a way of going about enacting a scenario through collective conscious energy and the earths own energy that aims to divide a nation and control a people? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That could work I guess. Haven&#39;t dabbled too much with amphetamines but I&#39;ve seen plenty of my friends become addicted to them and it&#39;s not a pretty end result. I would say everything in moderation . Except for weed. Lol.</p>

<p>Edit: so long as you take them as prescribed by a doctor shouldn&#39;t be a problem! </p>

<p>If your interested in the psychedelic approach I recommend listening to what graham Hancock has to say about ayahuasca and the proper ways to go about having these higher conscious experiences .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought about this a bit. I have this to say. The meditation you achieve while studying is good but I think that a stronger form of meditation is achieved when the end result is a purely selfish one. A homework assignment has ulterior motives no matter how much you enjoy it. I would say the key to good meditation is a personal hobby anything from poetry-fishing. The intent is what matters the most.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the Jesus from the Gospel of Thomas is a false Jesus. If you want to know what that false Jesus was talking about, you can enroll in any mystery school, or read into any occult literature, or, better yet, summon demons and learn from them, and they&#39;ll tell you exactly how to make the two into one and coalesce the male and the female. But in my experience your delving into that rabbit hole will only make you more deaf to what the true Jesus was actually talking about, which is a very bad idea. (Hint: the male represents the kinetic and the material, while the female represents the potential and the spiritual. To make the male and the female the same is to experience demonic possession and share the will of demons.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>basically, the male principle is the active force, the initiative that enacts change, while the female principle is the passive force, the opportunity that enables initiative and draws that initiative to itself. All mystery teaching refers to the coalescence of these two things, though it goes by many names. Anything you see about evolving the consciousness, for example, is a reference to this coalescence. The evolved consciousness recognizes opportunity and thereby takes the appropriate initiative to seize that opportunity, making the two into one. The part where evil comes in is how this world in present day is absolutely overrun by demonic powers. That is, the world is so overrun that each avenue of opportunity made available to the evolved, spiritual consciousness is actually an avenue engineered by demons. To recognize these opportunities with an evolved consciousness and fulfill them is therefore to do the will of demons - essentially to share one will with demons. There is much about this subject that will be impossible to grasp completely for one who is not spiritual, but I promise you I am telling the truth: you, and everyone, should stay as far away from these things as possible and instead sincerely examine the true Jesus of the Bible without prejudice. The occult is not a toy, the condition of your soul is a very serious thing, and Jesus actually does save in real life, straight up. If you can accept this information, please, accept it.</p>

<p>What makes you think there is some &quot;hidden meaning&quot; in the gibberish? Remember, the Gospel of Thomas was essentially stuck in the back of a library and forgotten about. It basically had no effect on anyone and was ignored for 2,000 years.</p>
