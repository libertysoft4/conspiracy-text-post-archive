    <div class="md"><p>What I find frustrating is that people tend to get either very aggressive or defensive if people don&#39;t agree with all their ideas. It should be possible to have mature discussions even with differing opinions. 
 The other annoying thing is people will make a comment like &quot;the answer is in plain sight, think outside the box&quot; as though they know more than everyone else, they then get defensive or continue the vague catchphrases when asked to explain.
 Its not very welcoming or helpful for someone that is agnostic on many of the topics on this sub.</p>

<p>What&#39;s Obama&#39;s agenda and what do you expect him to do? Surely you&#39;re aware that the country is divided on gun control, so it can&#39;t be terribly insane to expect one half (the left wing) calling for gun control while the other half (the right wing) rejects it.</p>

<p>And before I disappear into downvotes, both shroom and I are asking legitimate questions. Because I honestly don&#39;t know what Obama&#39;s agenda might be, and, frankly, this all seems insane. </p>

<p>I mean, even the NSA couldn&#39;t catch them all, and now one slipped through. What if the success of this latest attack is a rallying cry or signal to sleeper cells throughout the continent that NOW is the time to strike?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw the news headline saying something along the lines of &quot;Police found over 5,000 rounds of ammunition at shooter&#39;s house.&quot;  That just kind of bothers me because they were making a big deal like 5000 rounds is a lot of ammo for somebody to have.  Anybody that shoots very often is likely to have thousands of rounds lying around.  It&#39;s easy to go through 500+ a single trip to the range.  Sometimes there&#39;s a good sale on... sometimes you have a few different caliber firearms...thousand+ rounds a piece because it&#39;s a pain in the ass having to go buy ammo every time you want to shoot.</p>
