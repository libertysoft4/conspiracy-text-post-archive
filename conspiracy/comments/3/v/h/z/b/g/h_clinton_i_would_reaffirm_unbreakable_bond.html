<p>She&#39;s a supporter of Israel alright, but she doesn&#39;t actually say what OP and that left-leaning Israel Lobby ePaper claims she said.</p>

<p>Unbreakable bond with Uncle Bibi, what an ignorant claim.</p>

<p>Just so you know where I&#39;m coming from, I&#39;m not a great fan of her, and would rather see Sanders than a lapdog of the Israeli lobby in the WH, but this grasping at straws campaign shouldn&#39;t be necessary, and frankly doesn&#39;t seem to be in the spirit of his bid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How did I admit my own ignorance without having posted anything?  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t get it.  Do you mean that she didn&#39;t write the title of her own op-ed that is in the first person?  Is that your point?  Because that seems unlikely.</p>

<p>What it looks like to me is OP pointed out that you said she didn&#39;t say what she picked as the title of her op-ed and that you then diverted the discussion to something pointless avoid addressing that.</p>

<p>Just so you know where I&#39;m coming from, I think the Shillary thing is stupid too.  It&#39;s juvenile and not even clever.  Still the only error in what OP quoted was that it should have had how or ellipses at the beginning.  The ellipses he used did not distort or conceal the intent of the op-ed title.</p>

<p>Actually thinking that Hillary Clinton is the only person or candidate that is beholden to (i.e. a suck up to) Wall Street.</p>

<p>No offense, but lemmie guess:  You voted for Obama back in the day, eh?  Did you fall for his <em>“Yes we can!”</em> slogan?</p>

<p>It’s <em>all bullshit</em>, man.</p>

<p>Not only are the candidates and the politicians fucked up, but the <em>system</em> is putrid.  It kind of doesn’t matter <em>who</em> gets in.  The SYSTEM is putrid.

<p>It <em>is</em> a given that those are the choices - and, again, that’s the reason I don’t vote.  However, nobody’s saying anything about “quitting”.  I’m certainly not “quitting” and I <em>haven’t</em> quite.  I demonstrate, I protest, I educate myself and others, I’ve taken part in community edible garden planting, I participate.</p>

<p>I just think voting is absolute, complete shite, and I don’t participate in it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>sanders wants to break up the big banks</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>No he doesn’t.  Forgive my incredulity, but my feeling is that A) he’s only saying that to try to get in office, upon which we will do exactly <em>jack shit</em> (fuck Sanders and all others presidents that lie and say “I’m going to do ‘A’ when I get in office!” and then do the exact opposite.  Fuck them.), and B) if he gets in and <em>does</em> do what he says - or even <em>tries</em> to do it? - Bernie will find himself dead as a fucking doornail.  Either way, the banks’ll keep running shit.</p>

<p>If we the public don’t want the corporations to keep running and ruining this planet, then we can’t depend on the government to help because the corporations RUN the governments in the first place.  We need to depend on OURSELVES and each other.</p>

<p>So long as we don’t all come together as one people <em>independent</em> of the establishment, nothing’ll really get done or change.</p>

<p>How&#39;s <em>that</em> working out for you?</p>

<p>Wake the fuck up, man, and realize that you&#39;re doing nothing but carrying along and playing right into the manipulation that those far above you manipulate you with.</p>

<p>Be a good sheep now, go make a difference, and go vote, baby!  Vote!</p>

<p>Let&#39;s see...</p>

<p>Obama instead of John (&quot;Bomb Bomb Iran&quot;) McCain/Palin </p>

<p>Then Obama instead of Mit (&quot;I&#39;ll suck Netanyahu&#39;s cock&quot;) Romney/thatotherguy.</p>

<p>I&#39;d say ... we are better off -- absolutely no doubt in my mind.</p>

<p>edit/ps. i am not saying that i am &quot;100% satisfied&quot; with obama.  i am not.  i am just saying... &quot;not the same.&quot;</p>

<p>invading iran VS. not invading iran </p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/why-the-iraq-war-cost-2-trillion-2013-3">$6 trillion american tax dollars</a> (assume same cost as invasion of iraq)</p></li>
<li><p>10,000&#39;s of dead iranian children.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>look, i agree with you... in the eye of God, these are but farts of dust...</p>

<p>that being said, in the eye of God, everything you do is meaningless.</p>

<p>so yea... there&#39;s that.</p>

<p>i suppose we need to draw the line somewhere... </p>

<p>$6 Trillion saved and 10,000&#39;s of dead children averted is a safe line, I&#39;d say.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You really think a different candidate is what would stop the war train from moving forward?  You really think that the tax dollars that have been spent on the war machine <em>wouldn’t</em> be spent on the war machine if “this” verses “that” candidate would be elected?  Really?</p>

<p>My question was, &quot;how would you define &#39;so different&#39;&quot; ?</p>

<p>And &quot;Come on, man.&quot; is your answer??</p>

<p>Care to elaborate ? :)</p>

<p>The candidates, ultimately AREN&#39;T different.  That&#39;s the actual point.</p>

<p>Yeah.  &quot;<a href="http://www.drugbuyersguide.net/uploads/monthly_2015_07/The-illusion-of-free-choice.thumb.jpg.3dcf22ce400bd63f5dd40ae2495a52e8.jpg">so different</a>&quot;.</p>

<p>And &quot;Come on, man&quot; is my answer because that&#39;s all I could come up with to you (or anybody at this point) thinking what you&#39;re thinking:  That any current candidate or president is anything other than a puppet to the corporate bankers.</p>

<p>Again, &quot;difference in degree&quot;.  Not &quot;difference in kind&quot;.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdD9uSrNFT4">They&#39;re all the same</a>.</p>

<p><em>That&#39;s</em> what I mean by &quot;come on, man&quot;.</p>
