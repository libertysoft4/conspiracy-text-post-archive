<p>That is a claim made by the &quot;Flat Earth Society&quot;.  That group exists solely to mock the idea.  Most flat earth proponents do not make that claim and using it the way you have here is a strawman.</p>

<p>As for your original question, there is something up there to be seen with a telescope.  What it is exactly I&#39;m not sure.  But either way it is in no way conclusive or even anywhere near direct evidence for the shape of the earth.</p>

<p>EDIT: Seems they don&#39;t understand most of science. &quot;Specific gravity&quot; is a thing and they just don&#39;t know about it. Also, there are just so many memes with typos...do people actually take this blog seriously?!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Which statement leads you to believe that there is no understanding of angular velocity?  </p>

<p>As I said, I don&#39;t agree with everything there.  For example section 2(B) disputes the magnitude of the variance in the force felt at the pole to that felt at the equator.  I&#39;ve done the calc myself and the numbers work out assuming the official globe model using formulas for downward gravitational force and outward pushing centripetal.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve spent a decent amount of time on this topic and I think most of the prominent flat earth proponents are part of a limited hangout.  They point out problems with the official spinning globe model, but at the same time offer a flawed alternative model.  This tricks people into accepting a false dichotomy so that when they see the problems with the flat model they are deceived into forgiving the problems with the official spinning globe model.</p>

<p>Plus a purposely incorrect model is a lot easier to discredit and marginalize in the eyes of outsiders.  &quot;Flat earth theorists don&#39;t believe in gravity, they think the earth is moving upwards at 9.8 m/s.&quot;  So fragrantly stupid that the first instinct is to dismiss the entire theory and subject from the start.</p>

<p><a href="/u/Tychobrahe2020">/u/Tychobrahe2020</a> asks a question about Flat Earth theory that could be answered by looking into the topic for just a few minutes. It&#39;s not a great mystery as to what Flat Earthers have to say about the ISS, so we&#39;ve now established that <a href="/u/Tychobrahe2020">/u/Tychobrahe2020</a> isn&#39;t really interested in finding the truth, that&#39;s not why they&#39;re here.</p>

<p>Contrasting that blatant lack of knowledge on the subject, <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3vaata/can_anyone_who_believes_in_flat_earth_tell_me_why/cxlpz5v">here</a> is <a href="/u/Tychobrahe2020">/u/Tychobrahe2020</a> repeating the claim that the Earth accelerates upward 9.8m/s<sup>2</sup> . This claim originates from the Flat Earth Society and ends there. The vast majority of Flat Earthers see the claim as disinformation and the Flat Earth Society as a controlled opposition group. This too is basic knowledge to anyone who has actually investigated the topic.</p>

<p>Looking at <a href="/u/Tychobrahe2020">/u/Tychobrahe2020</a>&#39;s two-week account history, it doesn&#39;t look like they believe in a single conspiracy theory. In fact, the overwhelming majority of <a href="/u/Tychobrahe2020">/u/Tychobrahe2020</a>&#39;s posts are in relation to a fictional entertainment franchise.</p>

<p>Flat Earth isn&#39;t just saying the Earth is flat; it&#39;s a meta-conspiracy composed of many other conspiracies. If you still believe in things like the ISS or the moon landings, you aren&#39;t ready for Flat Earth. Go study those some more first.</p>
