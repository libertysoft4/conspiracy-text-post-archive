<p>There comes a point when you are a truther where you will realize that you can&#39;t stop the next war, shooting or manipulated event.  </p>

<p>If you are on r/conspiracy you know that someone is pulling the strings, and for sure it&#39;s those with lots of wealth and power.  Beyond this there could be occultists, satanists, or aliens - this is where it gets murky, nobody can say for sure (as of yet).</p>

<p>So armed with the truth that we know manipulation occurs and has been for THOUSANDS of years, now what?  Are we going to sit behind our computers and just live in the dark rabbit hole?  Do we just endlessly hunt the data stream for the next article or video clip to post somewhere?</p>

<p>Personally I have felt most powerful most inspired when I have been meditating, and making my personal space free of the things that are causing problems on the planet.  When I have chosen to empower myself and have a mission I feel a whole lot better about life.  (I haven&#39;t been lately, bogged down by many things beyond my control, hence this post).</p>

<p>I&#39;m looking for inspiration these days, new ways of thinking, new ways of being.  I know that the world is fucked up, and I see the truth, but I need some new knowledge, any suggestions?</p>

<p>Can we agree collectively on what we need to do to change this world?  Anyone out there have any ideas?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, you should focus on your goals. But don&#39;t fall for the new age meditation bullshit of positive thinking, believe me it&#39;s a deep trap you don&#39;t want to fall in. Meditate on the I AM. Learn to be comfortable with it always, and you will accept and deal with whatever happens to you in life. Beacause, if you truly understand the I am, you have nothing to fear in life. Focus on developing your mind, seek truth and be the change, be ready to open the eyes of your near that ask you about these issues. You need nothing, you have all you need to achieve this.</p>

<p>I cannot stress this enough: Avoid at all cost trying to convince other people to see your reality if they are bluepilled. You are more enlightened and it will blind them and get them in default attacking you.</p>

<p>Do what you can to get organized like I said, and be prepared to do the sit in, block traffic and what not only never use violence or a call to arms. Unless there is civil war of course.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Oh, yeah, sure. That&#39;s not meditation.  Stuff like that including things like The Secret are brainwashing and control mediums.</p>

<p>But I do think that the I AM, true meditation, contains within it unconditional love and acceptance.  If it didn&#39;t, you wouldn&#39;t be able to do it.</p>

<p>The belief that a trained conciousness, alone or in a group produces some kind of mysterious positive energy force certainly merits the label of religion.</p>

<p>But if that&#39;s a belief that cannot be proved or negated, according to current knowledge, I&#39;m not sure there is harm in believing in the possibility in itself that <em>it could be true</em>.</p>

<p>To me, that&#39;s just openmindedness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t use meditation for anything more then just calming down my erratic mind.  It also is a great program to start the day.  I find I am less reactive in my day if I meditate.</p>

<p>What I am really interested in, outside of debating the merits of meditation, which I know work for me and millions of others, is opting out of the current paradigm, and opting in to something that has goals like The Zeitgeist Movement or The Venus Project.  </p>

<p>One great concern I have with our modern society is that people can&#39;t seem to agree how to fix our current problems, on the right they have one focus, money, and really money is just a system to acquire power.</p>

<p>I think we need to stop powering this system, which in essence means not giving power to the TPTB.  This means first, not spending money on things that will destroy the planet, industries resources etc (shifting away as much as possible).  Secondly, getting away from the never ending growth model and cutting consumption down DRAMATICALLY.  Third like the big corporations, stop paying taxes into a corrupt government system.  </p>

<p>These are just a few ideas, and some collapse is inevitable (in any model including the current one).</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p><a href="http://spherebeingalliance.com/introduction">Every day focus on becoming more “Service To Others” oriented. Focus on being more “Loving” and “Focus on raising your Vibrational and Consciousness Level” and to learn to “Forgive Yourself and Others” (Thus “Releasing Karma”). This will change the Vibration of the Planet, The “Shared Consciousness of Humanity” and “Change Humanity One Person at a time” (Even if that “One Person” is yourself.). They say to treat your body as a temple and change over to a “Higher Vibrational Diet” to aid in the other changes. This sounds to many like a “Hippy Love and Peace” message that will not make a difference. I assure you the “Path” they lay out in “Their Message” is a difficult one. Even on the unlikely chance that these technologies stay “Suppressed”, imagine what a world we would live in if everyone made these changes to their selves?</a></p>

<p>-Corey Goode</p>

<p>Whether or not you consider Corey to be telling his truth, this message is indeed nothing like the violence and fear we see our media and our government perpetuate.</p>

<p>I think these ideas are a good starting point to bring change to the world.</p>

<p>Meditators in DC actually lowered the crime rate during their meditation:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.worldpeacegroup.org/washington_crime_study.html">source 1</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.mum.edu/about-mum/consciousness-based-education/tm-research/maharishi-effect/Summary-of-13-Published-Studies">source 2</a> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Washington, D.C.—Decreased Violent Crime (1981–1983) Maharishi University of Management (then called Maharishi International University) opened a branch campus in Washington, D.C., (the College of Natural Law) for the expressed purpose of creating coherence in the nation’s capital. A study using the transfer function approach of time series analysis, supported a causal relationship between participation in the group practice in the TM and TM-Sidhi programs at the College of Natural Law and decreased violent crimes in Washington over the two year period of their study. Alternative explanations in terms of weather, changes in police coverage, demographic shifts or increases in neighborhood watch programs could not account for the results (Dillbeck, et al., 1988). When the College of Natural Law had to move from Washington, beginning in 1986 and completed in 1987, the homicides in Washington, D.C. increased drastically to become the highest in the nation in 1990.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think if a large percentage of people quit arguing, labelling, consuming, paying taxes, and watching tv, and just sat down and meditated simultaneously, we could dismantle the control/manipulation matrix we live in very quickly.</p>

<p>I realize that this is exactly the &quot;new age shit&quot; that you are talking about, but it is was I believe.</p>

<p>If you still think that we can beat the law makers using the legislative process then you are more optimistic than I am.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are right I never have.  But I do know that if the west didn&#39;t like how they were doing things then we would either be in direct conflict, or there would be a proxy war there.  Since there isn&#39;t I assume that they have agreed to tow the line.  All speculation I am going to look into this further.  </p>

<p>Do you have any suggestions on where I should start?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like I said, organize on a local level, write your legislators that you demand change, stop corruption i.e., and if not, make demos, sit downs and what not. That&#39;s the only way in our system unless we make it a direct democracy with no parties and a hell of a lot less buerocrats. </p>

<p>A call to arms is what the ruling class wants. so they can put in the army and gun you all down like they have done for ages. Even in america.</p>

<p>you shouldn&#39;t think happy thoughts, you should be furios with anger and let them have it. The pain you feel is not your doing, it&#39;s them. They just love to make you think you are responsible, make you depressed and put you on meds, drugs or turn to alcoholism.</p>
