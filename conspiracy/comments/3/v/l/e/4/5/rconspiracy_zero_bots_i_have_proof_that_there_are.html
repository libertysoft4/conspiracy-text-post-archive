    <div class="md"><p>&quot;.. for us to influence..&quot; is it really about influencing? The people with the means to do something already know, they are just unwilling to act for fear of life. So are we really here to influence? Influence means you have an agenda that you wish to push, right or wrong. So I wouldn&#39;t say influence, because we aren&#39;t trying to make people see it our way. We aren&#39;t trying to make anyone do anything. Merely sharing useful information so as to be aware and make conscious decisions. I will never try to convince other with influence, just be assertive when I tell them what I think and why I think it. Influencing leads to looking like the paid opposition loons who make people who question things look idiotic. </p>

<p>I talked about it here, it&#39;s so suspicious because I posted links one is np reddit and another one is archive. is . People on the original thread from TIL were complaining about an outright fake quote from De Gaulle and the submitter was supposedly karmawhoring at the time of the Paris attacks or just plainly pushing an agenda that French and Americans must stick to each other right or wrong no matter what.</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3stggw/propaganda_in_til_sarc_til_during_a_nuclear_scare/">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3stggw/propaganda_in_til_sarc_til_during_a_nuclear_scare/</a></p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/3ss34g/til_during_a_nuclear_scare_in_1960_the_president">https://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/3ss34g/til_during_a_nuclear_scare_in_1960_the_president</a></p>

<p>So I resubmitted my mockery of the fake and manipulative TIL post and then replaced a few words with what I thought would be said by the US State Department in what I think is their shameless tactic of capitalizing on a advantageous tragedy to further their own interests and agenda.</p>

<p>Same results almost 14 total votes all in all fluctuating between 2, 0 ,1 net votes during the first few hours.</p>

<p>This is only my speculation as I have no proof whatsover but it could be possible that this account of mine might have been tagged or the <strong><em>new</em></strong> part of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is constantly being monitored.</p>

<p>My advice is that if you want to keep your sanity or peace of mind then it might be best if you forget about it and hope for the best, pray that your greatest fears/suspicions won&#39;t eventually come to pass. </p>

<p>Look at some cute kitty videos, read on the latest iphone features, etc. Stay away from the news, it&#39;s quite depressing. Hope seems all but lost. What was that St Paul said about the greatest power of man?, Faith, Love, and Hope. Seems more and more of a fantasy each passing day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From my first day after joining Reddit I&#39;ve been completely baffled by the inexplicable downvote that seems to spawn on my most ordinary and non controversial posts or comments. It&#39;s never made a bit of sense. I posted a question once that was loosely worded &quot;if you have information about criminal activities, but fear for your safety or the information relates to state authorities, what is the best way to make that information public without outing yourself?&quot;. I just couldn&#39;t figure out who would come along and keep downvoting a question like that but sure enough, it would climb to 2 up and a few minutes later be right back at 0. Climb to 4, fall to 0 again. I don&#39;t buy that there are just <strong>that</strong> many trolls browsing at just the right places and times and all setting sights on such ordinary shit like that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I spent the entire month of November 2014, right after Election Day, grabbing screenshots, with timestamps going  minute by minute, and proving, without a doubt, that there is vote manipulation of topics, based on keywords and other criteria, likely using an algorithm. I made a series of posts on this sub clearly proving and demonstrating how reddit manipulates the voting on topics. I had RES, reddit Votify and one other reddit voting extension, the name of which escapes me at the moment, installed to track the vote counts in the screenshots. The OP describes a common method of &#39;downvote  cancellation&#39; of certain topics that essentially keep a topics score at or near zero, making it appear there is little or no interest in certain subjects.  Thus making sure certain subjects never get to the &quot;hot&quot; queue, the default queue for the sub.</p>

<p>As a result of the vote manipulation and a couple other reassons I actually wiped out my posting history and stopped posting here a couple months later and went to Voat. </p>

<p>The OP is correct, vote manipulation of the topics on reddit and in this sub is very real.</p>

I just visit here out of habit, really. There is very little posted on Reddit that hasn&#39;t been tainted by manipulation. I&#39;ll be glad to see the other sites do well and I hope they hang in there long enough to capture an audience to sustain them. </p>

<p>No, I use the socks to post in other subs. I use this acct for this sub. I just used the socks as an upvote test, and I agree it is shady but it didn&#39;t really make a difference since it was a zeroed-out thread anyway. Either way, sock-puppets AND (apparantly) bots are used VERY OFTEN on reddit. NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. And if I have a sock don&#39;t you think Hillary&#39;s Super-PAC has about a thousand of them?

<p>Can confirm I have tried a similar test. Not with zero votes, but with negative votes. I sat for an hour creating socks and upvoting one particular post, and it still hit minus fourteen. I took the results to admin...</p>

<p>...And they accused me of brigading my own posts. It was Occaram (or whatever his name is), who offered to look into it, and him who made the accusation that I was brigading my own post. I wrote back and asked him why the post would have a minus fourteen score if I was brigading it with upvotes, if it wasn&#39;t being simultaneously brigaded down at the same time. He never wrote back after that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I definitely get the sense there is bot manipulation of votes. Technically, I don&#39;t see that this would be very difficult. Reddit is open source, and given the resources available to a certain alphabet agency, you&#39;d only need a small team to develop the kind of tools that would allow you to filter for key words in a post, or sources in a post, and upvote or downvote accordingly. I think doing it based on a user account would be simple too. I would not be surprised if these kinds of tools eventually make their way into corporate hands, if they aren&#39;t already. </p>

<p>Because of the unmistakable bot and shill factor, tools like <a href="http://www.redective.com/">reddective</a> and the <a href="http://redditenhancementsuite.com/">Reddit Enhancement Suite</a> are indispensable. Since I&#39;ve started using these tools, it&#39;s become easier to see what&#39;s going on when massive events like the Paris attacks and mass shootings take place. It&#39;s made for a better experience here. I know the users more than I could without them.</p>

<p>No, I use the socks to post in other subs. I use this acct for this sub. I just used the socks as an upvote test, and I agree it is shady but it didn&#39;t really make a difference since it was a zeroed-out thread anyway. Either way, sock-puppets AND (apparantly) bots are used VERY OFTEN on reddit. NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. And if I have a sock don&#39;t you think Hillary&#39;s Super-PAC has about a thousand of them? Just trying to get people&#39;s eyes open to the subterfuge that is going down...</p>

<p>Can confirm I have tried a similar test. Not with zero votes, but with negative votes. I sat for an hour creating socks and upvoting one particular post, and it still hit minus fourteen. I took the results to admin...</p>

<p>...And they accused me of brigading my own posts. It was Occaram (or whatever his name is), who offered to look into it, and him who made the accusation that I was brigading my own post. I wrote back and asked him why the post would have a minus fourteen score if I was brigading it with upvotes, if it wasn&#39;t being simultaneously brigaded down at the same time. He never wrote back after that.</p>

If they are using IP tracking to combat sock puppets, which I&#39;d have to assume they are, it&#39;s very possible they are reporting the votes as you think they should, to make it harder for you to catch on that they&#39;re nullifying votes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not about hating, there&#39;s a clear effort from TPTB to relocate us away from here, they don&#39;t like our stuff spilling over into other channels and influencing the sheep.  We need to look for all the popular places and go to them, it&#39;s not in our interest to go somewhere by ourselves, if Voat ever becomes popular it will be manipulated just like Reddit is.</p>
