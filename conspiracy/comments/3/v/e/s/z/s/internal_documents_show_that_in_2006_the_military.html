        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I just found this out when listening to <a href="https://www.corbettreport.com/who-is-really-behind-isis-transcript/">The Corbett Report&#39;s investigation into Who is Really Behind ISIS?</a></p>

<p>So it turns out that back in 2006 the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/09/AR2006040900890_pf.html">Washington Post</a> got its hands on some internal documents showing that the military was</p>

<blockquote>
<p>conducting a propaganda campaign to magnify the role of the leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This had been going on since 2004 and was specifically targeting the US people</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For the past two years, U.S. military leaders have been using Iraqi media and other outlets in Baghdad to publicize Zarqawi&#39;s role in the insurgency. The documents explicitly list the &quot;U.S. Home Audience&quot; as one of the targets of a broader propaganda campaign. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The documents show that this supposed leader of ISIS was in fact a very small player, and it was the people who </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some senior intelligence officers believe Zarqawi&#39;s role may have been overemphasized by the propaganda campaign, which has included leaflets, radio and television broadcasts, Internet postings and at least one leak to an American journalist. Although Zarqawi and other foreign insurgents in Iraq have conducted deadly bombing attacks, they remain &quot;a very small part of the actual numbers,&quot; Col. Derek Harvey, who served as a military intelligence officer in Iraq and then was one of the top officers handling Iraq intelligence issues on the staff of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told an Army meeting at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., last summer. </p>

<p>In a transcript of the meeting, Harvey said, &quot;Our own focus on Zarqawi has enlarged his caricature, if you will -- made him more important than he really is, in some ways.&quot; </p>

<p><strong>&quot;The long-term threat is not Zarqawi or religious extremists, but these former regime types and their friends,&quot;</strong> said Harvey, who did not return phone calls seeking comment on his remarks. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wonder what friends he is referring to there?</p>

<p>But so what? The military engages in psyops all the time, right? Why should we care about this one?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One internal briefing, produced by the U.S. military headquarters in Iraq, said that Kimmitt had concluded that, &quot;The Zarqawi PSYOP program is the most successful information campaign to date.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Makes you wonder what else they tell us that is simply made up? And makes you wonder about the timing. A propaganda campaign to inflate someone&#39;s importance a year or two before their profile on the world stage explodes? Must be a coincidence...</p>

<p>The Pentagon military analyst program was revealed in David Barstow&#39;s Pulitzer Prize winning report appearing April 20, 2008 on the front page of the New York Times and titled Behind TV Analysts, Pentagon’s Hidden Hand</p>

<p>The Bush/Cheney/Rumsfeld covert propaganda program was launched in early 2002 by then-Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs Victoria Clarke. The idea was to recruit &quot;key influentials&quot; to help sell a wary public on &quot;a possible Iraq invasion.&quot; Former NBC military analyst Kenneth Allard called the effort &quot;psyops on steroids.&quot; [1]
Eight thousand pages of the documents relative to the Pentagon military analyst program were made available by the Pentagon in PDF format online May 6, 2008 at this website: <a href="http://www.dod.mil/pubs/foi/milanalysts/">http://www.dod.mil/pubs/foi/milanalysts/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what I believe. At most two degrees. They were quite good friends for a while during, and after, the end of the Russian invasion of Afghanistan. Although I haven&#39;t done that much research and it is difficult to find out which person had contact with who because of the thousands of terrorist groups in the world. Iraq alone has around 440 terrorist groups. Also there is loads of contradicting information. For instance on the English wikipedia page it even says that Zarqawi met with Osama at the end of the war. Which was before his inprisonment in 1992. But it then quotes a report that says they first met in 1999. There are also loads of things that the wiki fails to mention. </p>

<p>Anyway, here is how I believe it went down from the reading I have done. In the late 80&#39;s Zarqawi went to Afghanistan to help fight the Russians. When he got there the war ended and he did no fighting, but ended up meeting and befriending Osama who was fighting Russians and helped by some country I have never heard of... Osama tried to coerce Zarqawi into joining al-Qaeda but he refused saying that his only interest was in killing jews and toppling the monarchy in Jordan. He eventually went back and tried to do so and failed and spent his time in jail from 1992 till 1999. When he got out of jail Osama and Zarqawi reunited and Osama helped create the Jund al-Sham. That&#39;s where my &quot;knowledge&quot; ends. </p>

<p>Anyway, it&#39;s always quite peculiar to see how these zealous and frankly fucked up people seem to switch from ideals on a dime. Why abandon Jordan and go to Afghanistan when you&#39;re so passionate about toppling a regime you&#39;re willing to kill a boatload of people for it.</p>

<p>Great point. This is why I&#39;ve always felt that the religious, jihad angle was just a cover. Maybe the &#39;ground troops&#39; have really been manipulated into thinking that this behavior is congruent with their religious beliefs... but there is no way that the people controlling and influencing these groups believe in this shit. Their actions show otherwise.</p>

<p>(which is also why, I think, Islam has been framed in the mainstream as a religion of violence. It stops people from asking why the hell people who are supposedly willing to die for their religion are at the strip club drinking booze a week before their big operation)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Zarqawi supposedly beheading Nick Berg.  I always though this tidbit about Nick Berg was extremely interesting:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On May 14, 2004, it was revealed that Nick Berg had been investigated during the U.S. government&#39;s investigation of Zacarias Moussaoui. Berg&#39;s email address had been used by Moussaoui prior to the September 11, 2001, attacks. According to Berg&#39;s father, Nick Berg had a chance encounter with an acquaintance of Moussaoui on a bus in Norman, Oklahoma. This person had asked to borrow Berg&#39;s laptop computer to send an email. Berg gave the details of his own email account and password, which were later used by Moussaoui.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Berg#Encounter_with_Zacarias_Moussaoui">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Berg#Encounter_with_Zacarias_Moussaoui</a></p>

<p>There&#39;s a whole section in Zarqawi&#39;s wiki about the questioning of his importance or if he even existed.  </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Musab_al-Zarqawi#Doubts_about_his_importance">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Musab_al-Zarqawi#Doubts_about_his_importance</a></p>

<p>But then under his &quot;death&quot; section, there&#39;s this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Zarqawi&#39;s death was seen a major coup for the U.S. government in terms of the political and propaganda stakes. However, unconfirmed rumors in early April 2006 suggested that Zarqawi had been demoted from a strategic or coordinating function to overseer of paramilitary/terrorist activities of his group and that Abdullah bin Rashed al-Baghdadi of the Mujahideen Shura Council succeeded Zarqawi in the former function. On June 15, 2006, the United States military officially identified Abu Ayyub al-Masri as the successor to Al-Qaeda in Iraq.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So this guy who may have never existed passed on his position and power to this Al Baghdadi guy.  What does the Pentagon have to say about Al Baghdadi?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Brigadier General Kevin Bergner, the chief American military spokesman, said the elusive Baghdadi was actually a fictional character whose audio-taped declarations were provided by an elderly actor named Abu Adullah al-Naima.</p>

<p>The ruse, Bergner said, was devised by Abu Ayub al-Masri, the Egyptian-born leader of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, who was trying to mask the dominant role that foreigners play in that insurgent organization.</p>

<p>The ploy was to invent Baghdadi, a figure whose very name establishes his Iraqi pedigree, install him as the head of a front organization called the Islamic State of Iraq and then arrange for Masri to swear allegiance to him. Ayman al-Zawahiri, Osama bin Laden&#39;s deputy, sought to reinforce the deception by referring to Baghdadi in his video and Internet statements.</p>

<p>Yeah, if anything is clear about this whole situation it&#39;s that the media is being lied to from top to bottom, and even the people inside the military and DOJ don&#39;t really know what&#39;s going on. You really cannot trust anything you read when it comes to any of these people.</p>
