<p>Get into a fight with co-workers who threw you a baby shower.  </p>

<p>Go home during office Christmas party, leave baby at home.  </p>

<p>Come back with <strong>THREE</strong> people dressed in black combat gear hiding their faces.  </p>

<p>Police chase black SUV with no footage of said chase.  </p>

<p>Police shoot up SUV with no footage.  </p>

<p>Police say it was just the husband and wife, no third person.</p>

<p>Case closed?  Fuck that.  There is more to this than what they are telling you.  Most likely their CIA handlers blackmailed them.  Told them to go park the SUV somewhere.   CIA handlers go shoot up place, then drive similar SUV past where the parents were told to wait.  Police roll up on them and turn the car into swiss cheese.  </p>

<p>Seriously, is there any footage of them chasing the SUV or shooting at it?  If there is zero, then I&#39;m calling BS.  You have LA/Southern California the king of high speed news chases, see OJ Simpson, but in this case no helicopter was allowed to follow this chase before they shot it up.  Not one?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said. If this is how the event is being summed up, then there is a problem with that scenario. It makes no sense. Your more likely explanation makes more sense to me. But the problem we have now is we&#39;re moving away from explanations of events that involve <em>evidence</em>. Evidence has been replaced by faith-based explanations. An event occurs, the media are given a script as the event unfolds, and asking for evidence is considered crass, because we must respect the victims and their families, or somesuch. It&#39;s as if to ask for evidence is wrong.</p>

<p>So while I like your explanation, there is no evidence. And it doesn&#39;t appear there is much evidence for the narrative we&#39;ve been provided with in the mainstream coverage. At least as far as I know. And we won&#39;t get it, because asking for evidence is wrong. That&#39;s where we&#39;re at right now. And I think it&#39;s getting worse.</p>

I was watching the local news (I am in LA) and a husband and wife saw the 3rd guy that was hiding around a church as the sun went down.  They saw him with a rifle trying to play it off and running down an alley, taking his camo off and having an orange shirt underneath... anyone else heard about that?  The couple was on tv that night and they called the cops 3 times trying to help get him and they said they had him in custody....  all on the scanner too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This. There are way too many inconsistencies. Two eye-witnesses, including the officer on radio during engagement, reported a &quot;dark skinned male&quot;. That is not a dark skinned male. The people will never know the real story and that makes me sick for the families that have lost loved ones during this tragedy. This is bigger than terrorism - rich powerful people are being protected by this scapegoat. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A second lawyer, Mohammad Abuershaid, described Ms. Malik as a “caring” and “soft-spoken” housewife who spoke Urdu and broken English. She prayed five times a day, he said, and did not drive. <strong>He added that male relatives of Mr. Farook had never seen her face because she always kept it covered in their presence.</strong></p>

<p>“She was a very, very private person,” Mr. Abuershaid said. “She kept herself pretty isolated.”</p>

<p>When I watched the video on the news, the SUV was a black one as the news said and filmed it  being next to a white picket fence on  a 4 laned street</p>

<p>Then after looking online, i found this image: </p>

<p><a href="http://i3.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article6943005.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Scenes-showing-the-shooting-at-the-San-Bernardino-Inland-Regional-Center.jpg">http://i3.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article6943005.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Scenes-showing-the-shooting-at-the-San-Bernardino-Inland-Regional-Center.jpg</a></p>

<p>The similar one in this photo (lower right hand corner) is identical but theres no damage to it yet in the other news pictures the suspects car was rammed by  the green swat truck and was heavily shot up and yet this one here is next to an island.</p>

<p>In the images of the SUV on the other news coverage, no island is present. Is there a connection here? Hmm... </p>

<p>Sandy Hook had the chase through the woods as well as reports of more than one shooter, although those are far less substantial than the Columbine ones.</p>

<p>The Aurora theatre shooting also had reports of more than one person in a gas mask. I believe more than one mask was found at the scene too. Again, multiple witnesses had the same claim that they saw another shooter.</p>

<p>But of course, <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> has it all figured out. Because, you know, human eye witness accounts are notoriously inaccurate, so naturally that manes every witness statement that goes against what we want to believe must be mistaken.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In fact, one initial report from Littleton began: &quot;Three young men in fatigues and black trench coats opened fire at a suburban Denver high school Tuesday...,&quot; and also noted that a &quot;third young man was led away from the school in handcuffs more than four hours after the attack, and student Chris Wisher said: &#39;He&#39;s one of the ones who shot at us&#39;&quot; (Associated Press, April 20, 1999). This third suspect has, oddly enough, never been identified or even mentioned again by the press.</p>

<p>In a televised interview, the mother of a student who had escaped the attack quoted her daughter as saying that she &quot;looked up and saw a gunman in a black trench coat with a very huge gun ... He had dark brown hair, thick bushy eyebrows and was very ugly,&quot; a description that clearly did not fit either Harris or Klebold. When asked if the gunman was a student, the mother replied that: &quot;She didn&#39;t recognize him as a student. No. Not as a student&quot; (KUSA-TV, April 20, 1999; transcript posted on The Konformist) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah there is some really strange stuff going on there. IIRC many of the students actually said the third person was a student at the school and identified him by name. I believe there were multiple reports of him throwing explosives onto the roof of the school early on in the event.</p>

<p>Either way, the quality of the eye witness statements at Columbine in regards to the third shooter seems to be far higher than those about Sandy Hook, and maybe only slightly better than the ones at Aurora.</p>

<p>I always felt pretty strongly those Columbine witnesses were credible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For the aurora shooting, it was because he left through the exit, put a clamp on the door, and then came back in, which people confused as two people. Not sure about the source of the second mask, although bringing a spare isn&#39;t beyond believability.</p>

<p>Another case is the Ottawa shooting, initial reports had upwards of 5 &quot;suspects&quot;, and an entire extra location that had no shooting (the Rideau Centre). Initial witness statements confused the parliamentary driver as an accomplice , and some plain clothed police (after the event) as being involved. There&#39;s video of the entire event from when he gets back in his car to the front steps of parliament that show no accomplices.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I didn&#39;t.  The last line was tongue-in-cheek. My point was actually that while eye witness testimony, especially testimony about traumatic events, is notoriously inaccurate it doesn&#39;t mean that every single eye witness testimony ever given is inaccurate. </p>

<p>I see it a lot in <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> where they believe the testimony of some, but completely dismiss others for the reason that they were involved in trauma and they probably are not remembering things right. I try not to selectively believe witnesses based on what they witnessed.</p>

<p>also, whats the reasoning behind opening the opening the apartment of the san bernadino shooter to the media? isnt it a crime scene? seems like the media is trying to serve up indeniable proof that these were the only people involved, &quot;see! see, look here, look with your eyes at the appartment!&quot; </p>

<p>They are swinging this one hard. </p>

<p>Sources tell CNN: investigators believe Tashfeen Malik during attack pledged allegiance on FB to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi</p>

<p>Kind of makes ya wonder why no one can come up with a picture of the girl. The feds say she passed visa screening so she must have a visa/passport image. What gives? Why are they hiding the girls identity?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Tashfeen Malik&quot; should have had her photo taken many times as part of her K-1 Visa process. I know women who came here on K-1 visas. The Department of Homeland security should have photos of her before she came here as per the pre-marriage application proccess, on her passport, after she arrived at her local INS center, and when she got her greencard as a resident alien. She was fingerprinted and background checked, like everyone who came her on a K-1 and became a resident.</p>

<p>&quot;Tashfeen Malik&quot; is just as guilty as her husband, but is treated as an afterthought or someone in the background, with people SPECULATING that she &quot;radicalized&quot; her husband.</p>

<p>I submit to you that &quot;Tashfeen Malik&quot; is really a &quot;code name&quot;. Her Facebook page was under a different name. Her name comes up empty on the databases online. Why is her last name different from her husband&#39;s? Is there any proof they were married? Is all the info coming from the family lawyer? What did the FBI agent really say about what we know about her? Where is he getting his info? Why didn&#39;t he give the media her photo that is IN THE FEDERAL SYSTEM?</p>

<p>Lazy reporting or government cover-up?</p>
