The first photo shows the vehicle located next to 1807 E Bernardino Ave, the second photo shows the vehicle located near the intersection of Richardson and E San Bernardino Ave. The third photo, a screen shot from Google Street View from 1807 E Bernardino Ave, shows that Richardson in not even remotely near the alleged scene of the suspect apprehension.</p>

<p>Zoom in on the mailboxes in Google Street View, to confirm the addresses. They don&#39;t add up.</p>

(Although it appears he was only permitted to photograph from one spot)</p>

<p>What I don&#39;t understand is that the car is completely shot to shit on the front yet all the police officers are set up behind the suspect when the news cameras get there to an already dead perp. Doesn&#39;t make much sense at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are stopped somewhere near the 1807 mailbox. Look at the fire hydrant in your first picture, it looks like it is right under the mailbox, however if you look at street view it is probably 100 feet down the road. Also look at the Richardson sign and the railroad tracks, in the picture they look like they are right on top of each other, but look on the map and the tracks are actually further away from Richardson than the car is from Richardson.</p>

<p>Really high zoom compresses the perspective and makes everything looks really close together. And this is an exceptionally high zoom lens. Low-zoom (wide angle), like what is used on the Google street view car, does the opposite and makes the perspective appear like things are far apart. So you are comparing a very very high zoom photo to a very wide angle photo.</p>

<p>I was a professional photographer for newspapers, these images make sense to me because of the type of lenses being used. Lenses used to this extreme do distort the look from what you are used to seeing though, which is why it doesn&#39;t look &quot;right&quot; but nothing here was faked or manipulated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Richardson is at 1600. It&#39;s 2 full blocks away. The photographer zoom is massive. But when I looked at google maps everything fell into place if you consider that 1600 - 1950 is all within the shot of the photo. Even the red car that appears close to the SUV is actually several houses <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@34.0775507,-117.246743,3a,75y,210.63h,71.7t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sqeoVXFXp-hZkvBlAmmnv6Q!2e0!7i13312!8i6656">away</a></p>
