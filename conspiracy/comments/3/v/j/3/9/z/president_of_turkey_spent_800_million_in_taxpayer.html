ERDOGAN DECORATES $615 MILLION PALACE AS PRESIDENCY COST SURGES
06-Nov-2014
(Picture here)
Photographer: Adem Altan/AFP/Getty Images The new presidential palace, known as Ak Saray, or White Palace, stands on the outskirts of Ankara on Oct. 29, 2014</p>

<p>(Emphasis added)<em>A palace four times the size of Versailles. A custom-built Airbus jet. Dozens of servants.</em></p>

<p>Since becoming Turkey’s president in August, Recep Tayyip Erdogan has turned this once-ceremonial post into a new seat of power that is transforming how Turkey is ruled -- and he’s making sure the seat in question has all the trappings too.</p>

<p>The new palace, inaugurated last week, was originally intended for the prime minister, and comes at a cost of about $615 million, the official Anadolou news agency cited Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek as saying. The Airbus jet cost $185 million, according to Simsek, after it was refitted with Erdogan’s own design specifications.</p>

<p>The largesse has drawn the ire of opponents who accuse Erdogan of tramping on the country’s political system, according to Atilla Yesilada, an economist at GlobalSource Partners, a New York-based consultancy.</p>

<p>The palace, which was constructed against court orders in a national park, shows Erdogan’s “increasing sense of being above the country he governs and the rule of law,” Yesilada said by phone. “Whoever criticizes Erdogan and the ruling elite’s behavior is labeled a betrayer of the nation.”</p>

<p>Erdogan’s office did not comment when contacted by e-mail. Erdogan told a meeting of the ruling AK Party on March 5 that “no one can prevent the completion of this building. If they are powerful enough, let them come and demolish it.”</p>

<p>Lavish Spending</p>

<p>As prime minister for 11 years, Erdogan presided over annual economic growth that averaged about 5 percent, better than most of his predecessors. That assures him of continued popular support, according to Anthony Skinner, head of analysis for the Middle East and North Africa at U.K.-based forecasting company Maplecroft.</p>

<p>Erdogan can count on that support, and his mandate as the country’s first directly elected president, while he “spends taxpayers’ money on lavish” furnishings for his office, said Skinner.</p>

<p>The new presidential pad, the AK Saray, or White Palace -- a play on the name of Turkey’s ruling AK Party -- was also designed, in part, by Erdogan. It has 1,000 rooms, green granite inlays, and washrooms with silk wallpaper, said Tezcan Karakus Candan, head of Ankara’s Chamber of Architects, which tried to stop the building work with 33 court cases starting in 2007. Mature plane trees in the grounds, which probably cost about $3,750 apiece to import, subsequently died, she said.</p>

<p>‘New Turkey’</p>

<p>The palace’s floor area of 289,000 square meters (3.1 million square feet) exceeds that of the world’s current largest residential palace, the Istana Nurul Iman palace of the Sultan of Brunei, which was completed in 1984 at a cost of $442 million, according to the Guinness Book of Records.</p>

<p>Erdogan has repeatedly said he would like to replace Turkey’s parliamentary system with a more presidential one. So far, his supporters have lacked the two-thirds parliamentary majority necessary to alter the constitution. Even so, Erdogan says he’ll be an “active” president by chairing weekly cabinet meetings, which former heads of states rarely did.</p>

<p>Erdogan has vowed to work closely with Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu who will use the former presidential residence for receptions. “The new Turkey should express itself with something new,” Erdogan said, referring to the plane and the other trappings of his office.</p>

<hr/>

<p>So what do you think people, is he trying to make a slick move to pay for (or hide) all his lavishness?</p>

<p>(FPEDIT) I just wanna say as a long time lurker that I love and respect this sub and its indomitable spirit. For all the shit that gets spammed here it is one of the last watering holes for new (and old) and interesting information that falls outside of  politically correct mainstream narratives. Thank you for the dedicated people who make this place somewhat readable. And thank you to the people who are payed to be on here by the FBI or Englin AFB who respect their fellow citizens enough to give us a nod and a wink when we are looking down the right holes.</p>

<p>Wow... Our sad leadership can&#39;t come up with any lies more creative than that.  How sad for them that their proxy war to take over the middle east isn&#39;t working out the way they planned.  I guess world domination isn&#39;t all that easy after all.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That makes a lot of sense. I just ask because the alternative to getting involved in the conflict is sitting idly by as these terrorist organizations wreak havoc in the region, so if Russia is &quot;taking the bait&quot; to me it seems like they&#39;re doing the only thing that they think they can do.</p>

<p>If this is indeed the plan of the masterminds behind this, and it pains me to say it, they really have done a quite incredible job of orchestrating such a situation to where no matter what Russia decides to do they lose.</p>

<p>I feel as if Russia&#39;s, and the rest of the non-Western world, only chance to win this war is for the American public to wake up as to what is going on. As it stands now Russia could put forth indisputable proof that the Turks are buying ISIS oil and as long as the state department releases a statement saying &quot;no&quot; a large majority of the American public will brush it off and attribute it to being Russian propaganda. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The evil of all men is in their ignorance, that&#39;s why Baphomet wants to share the light of knowledge with you. lol. But seriously, we are on the internet slinging speculations around about real world problems that we find unsatisfactorily resolved, of course we are sure of our selves. There are no social pressures to conform to other peoples ideas on the internet because there&#39;s (usually) no real world consequence one way or the other. We are in fact very unsure about our theories as individuals which is why we are always looking for new evidence to support our outlandish and un-airtight theories. We enjoy life because its better than letting all of the negativity absorb you, some even get a joyous laugh or two by reading outlandish theories that may (or may not) have some nugget of truth. As some guy once said &quot;It&#39;s the hallmark of a healthy mind to entertain an idea without letting it consume you.&quot; or something like that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Heres a comment from the original Bloomberg article </p>

<p>&quot;Erdogan is the embodiment of unmannerliness. He wasted the
money of Turkish people for this 100% illegal building. He is full of
hatred. He wants to take vengeance on all the founders of modern Turkey, to
start with Ataturk, and the people who try to follow the principles of
Ataturk. This building, which is nothing
but a way to satisfy Erdogan’s ego, was built in the middle of the Ataturk’s
forest/farm, where Ataturk himself had planted the first trees working as a
gardener. The choice of the presidential building at that particular spot is so
cheap and common. Erdogans show off turned into a rip-off.</p>

<p>Only one example:
During Erdogan’s regime more than 5000 mine workers were
killed due to inadequate facilities and conditions in the mines (during the last 12 years).
His and his party’s reaction was: “That’s God’s will. You can
not do anything about it.” The poor mine workers were even told to bring their
lunch from home and were not served any food in the mines. No recreational areas! They were
not even allowed to go “up” to the fresh air during their lunch break. They had
to eat their food like rats and alike under the ground. Serving food or transporting the workers to the fresh air would be too costly! Yet Erdogan’s gov’t could find money for that peculiar building.
The ex-president of Turkey, Mr. Gul, from Erdogan’s party, is still allowed to use the presidential residence
which is situated at a most beautiful spot on Bosphorus. He is there since the last 
presidential elections (August 2014). He
has 50 servants! Not to mention the other people working for him. He is not the
president anymore. Who is paying all this? Turkish government! Yet the
government “does not have sufficient funds” to improve the working conditions of the
mine-workers as mentioned above.</p>

<p>This would have not happened in any democratic country in
the world. Besides, the democracy in today’s Turkey is very debatable. Erdogan
won the elections with the votes of the uneducated people, who were trained to
believe what they hear rather than what they search and learn. This was a well
orchestrated plan since 1950’s. Due to an official poll, 1 out 16 Erdogan
supporters reads “only one book per year” whereas the other 15 simply do not
read anything (besides newspapers). (The average number in the entire population: 1 book per 9 capita per
year.) That is why when Erdogan speaks to the other politicians in a very ill
manner, or bangs on the table and slams the door leaving the studio during a live
TV round-table, or tells his people how many kids they should have; what they
should drink instead of alcohol; what kind of theater plays are “suitable for a
religious youth”, those ignorant idiots see him as a hero and a saviour and vote for him.
Because they need to have a politician who should decide for them and dictate
them what they should do. (Erdogan still does not understand why many people call him a dictator) 
Erdogan had repeatedly said in the past “Democracy is
not a goal to reach but a means (vehicle) to reach your goal. As soon as you
reach your goal you step out of it”.</p>

<p>What else would you expect from such a man?&quot;</p>

<p>Once again, not my words, but an interesting perspective.</p>

<p>If it was for sale, the White House is estimated to have a selling price of $320 million, according to the real estate website Zillow.com. </p>

<p>Air force one-- $ 390 million U.S. Estimated*</p>

<p>Ottomans were used to put wedge between Islam and Orthodox Christianity who will near end times (Armageddon) will make an alliance with real Muslims.</p>

<p>The crimes of Ottoman Empire was;</p>

<ul>
<li>Stealing Hagia Sophia from Orthodox Christians and converting to Mosque. (Forbidden by Real Islamic laws)</li>
<li>Keeping Orthodox Christians women as concubines known as harem (Forbidden by Real Islamic laws)</li>
<li>Kidnapping Christian young boys and raising them as bodyguards called Janissary brigade (Forbidden by Real Islamic laws)</li>
</ul>

<p>Currently Turkey is up to its old tricks since Russia is defacto center of Orthodox Christianity and Erdogan is the man for the job.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, thank you for a well formulated reply. I think that  people definitely miss some of the larger historical and cultural contexts of the world stage. Its painfully obvious and not too often discussed that most people waging violence across the world are not motivated by a noble cause but self interest and conquest. Through the open exchange of ideas we can hopefully change the world for the better and maybe Armageddon wont be so bad... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This isn&#39;t personal, it&#39;s just watchdogging. The world is watching. Erdogan was much more respected earlier on, even often compared to Ataturk, but now his government is more often implicated in serious corruption and this story is just a small piece to the puzzle. This isn&#39;t Western vs. Eastern hemisphere, EU vs. Turkey or even USA vs. Turkey. Our nations are allies and we&#39;re just observing how this relationship plays out from the sidelines, like bored housewives reading about the latest Hollywood affair.</p>

Turkey&#39;s presidential House was small, old and ugly. Turks also deserve something like the White House. Plus, the palace will stay there for the next presidents, it is not of Erdogan, it is the property of the public.
Turkey&#39;s president and prime minister didn&#39;t have a dedicated airplane. The US president does have the Air Force One. Now the Turkish government has one for their president too.</p>

<p>I really don&#39;t see any problem besides truly hating every action this man does. I agree that you criticize his politics, but this is really getting ridiculous.</p>
