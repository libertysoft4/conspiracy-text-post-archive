        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">989</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2015-12-08 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/magnora7.html">magnora7</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It&#39;s a bit frustrating how much public denial there is, especially when it&#39;s become obvious <a href="http://www.globes.co.il/en/article.aspx?did=1001084873">Turkey is buying ISIS oil, and Israel is ending up with most of it.</a> This is funding ISIS, to the tune of $1.5M per day. </p>

<p>ISIS is a tool of the west, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3vss9j/nato_has_ruled_out_sending_ground_troops_to_fight/">that&#39;s why NATO just decided against having troops on the ground to fight ISIS.</a>  Because ISIS is our Ally, not our enemy! They want to overthrow Assad in Syria and install an Israel/US friendly puppet government, instead of the Russia/Iran puppet government that is currently in place.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the same reason Russia made more progress in bombing ISIS in 2 days than the US did in 2 years. Because the US wasn&#39;t really bombing them. <a href="http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=188_1411748599">They were telling them to evacuate the buildings before they bombed them</a>, and they were also bombing empty fields.</p>

<p>Why does ISIS drive 95% Toyota Tacoma/Hilux trucks? <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2015/10/the-u-s-government-supplied-isis-iconic-pickup-trucks.html">Because the Department of State gave them to them. </a></p>

<p>All this is because ISIS is the US government&#39;s secret allies, because Israel wants to overthrow Syria, but the western governments don&#39;t want anyone to know who is doing it because it is illegal under international law. More importantly it undermines international confidence in our trustworthiness and other nations may refuse to trade with us and ally with us if they know we are openly using such dirty tactics involving so many foreign mercenaries to the point where we created an entire army with a name, ISIS. So instead we act like it&#39;s all 100% ISIS&#39;s fault, and that the US/Israel had nothing to do with it other than making some Muslims mad from previous bombings. This is the narrative of all the media channels. </p>

<p>But now that the west has gotten caught by the international media in funding and arming ISIS, they pretend it&#39;s all Turkey and Saudi Arabia. They&#39;re the next level of fall guys after the pure ISIS blame. Israel and the US are running out of layers of credible deniability if Americans would just wise up a bit. But people are largely eating up the story that it&#39;s 100% Turkey and Saudi Arabia&#39;s faults. But who grows the military of these countries? NATO and the US. Who controls both those? The Israeli Government (or Zionists, to be more accurate, which is a religious ideology about retaking Mount Zion in Jerusalem that is intertwined with the goals of the Israeli Government including expanding Israel to overtake Palestine). That&#39;s why Israeli lobbyists make up the biggest lobbying groups in the US. That&#39;s why Israel is our #1 military aid recipient. </p>

<p>The US is the #1 arms exporter in the world. The CIA is known for overthrowing countries and installing new governments. People know these individual facts, but they need to step back and put the pieces together. </p>

<p>Syria is being overthrown because they want control of the land, the oil, the pipeline routes, the central bank, the war reconstruction profits, and the government. They want it all. And why not sell a few thousand missiles and bombs and drones and tanks in the meantime? For them, this is win win. Profits and power gains. They care not for the human death toll, except for how it hurts their PR image. So that&#39;s just a matter of media messaging, to convince the public it&#39;s for humanitarian reasons (&quot;Assad is gassing his own people and we need to stop him!&quot;). Or revenge reasons. (&quot;Paris attack was done by ISIS, let&#39;s bomb Syria, fuck those guys!&quot;) The public is convinced, and they keep getting away with it. Emotional manipulation. </p>

<p>Boiled down, it&#39;s simple. <strong>The western governments are supporting ISIS, not fighting them. And who is the head of the western governments: The US and Israel.</strong>  </p>

<hr/>

<p>Why do 90% of Americans have so much trouble thinking in this direction? I guess people just <em>really</em> don&#39;t want to believe that their media and government could tell such a dirty deep lie so consistently, that they&#39;ve all been fooled, and that the media and government just simply 100% can&#39;t be trusted to deliver truthful information anymore, even on the big stuff. That&#39;s a big pill to swallow. Too big for 90% of Americans? Mark Twain said it&#39;s easier to fool a man than it is to convince him he&#39;s been fooled. This is because of pride and ego, which Americans have no shortage of. We&#39;re far too busy justifying mistakes to be able learn from them.</p>

<p>How far away does the media have to get from reality before people start connecting the dots?</p>

<p>They say every new truth goes through 3 stages of public acceptance as the idea spreads: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>It is ignored, laughed at, ridiculed.</p></li>
<li><p>Then, it is opposed and debated furiously.</p></li>
<li><p>Last, it is accepted as obvious fact. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>I think when it comes to this subject matter, the American public is still largely in stage 1, quite unfortunately. People are in stage 2 about Turkey and Saudi&#39;s relationship to ISIS, but the US and Israel are left unquestioned by the MSM. I think Russia is in stage 3 about this, Putin called out the US&#39;s behavior to the UN in a recent speech, and many other speeches before. In Russia this is open and well-known, but in the US it is a dirty secret that is being covered up by propaganda as much as possible. </p>

<p>I just really don&#39;t get how people are still fooled by this, much less 90% of Americans. It&#39;s time as a culture we wake up and embrace what may be a scary truth, so that we can make positive progress. The fact we are being lied to is out in the open. We can&#39;t accomplish anything while everyone is in denial of what the problem is, as Americans largely are. </p>

<p>We can&#39;t depend on any media to do this for us, we must talk to each other. It&#39;s clear the media has no interest in conveying truth anymore, it is simply a propaganda machine for the governments of Israel and the US, and for the corporations (many of whom make up the military-industrial complex), so now it is up to us to communicate the truth to each other. The burden is on us to grow beyond our emotional attachments to our worldviews, and to see the world from many different angles so that we can see the truth, and to help each other see that truth.</p>

<p>Almost no one is saying that they should work with the Syrian government to wipe out ISIS. This military buildup has nothing to do with ISIS, they want Assad out. They know they failed and Russia hijacked anti-terrorism narrative and making the western governments look incompetent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The US presence and meddling in Georgia and Ukraine caused those conflicts. Remember when John McCain was running for President and went on TV proclaiming that we are all Georgians? He then proceeded to nose dive in the election. Because fuck Georgians and fuck cold war monger idiots like McCain.</p>

<p>China, Russia, Iran, and N Korea don&#39;t fuck around in our neighborhood because it destabilizes our region and causes national security concerns. Obviously then, the reverse would be true. American and EU fuckery in Russia&#39;s neighborhood is the sole reason for the conflicts.</p>

<p>Want me to provide a list of countries the US and her allies have invaded and overthrown in the last 20 years? Russia has every right to be busy protecting it&#39;s national interests. Don&#39;t start crying and hating the game just because your side is losing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Russia didn&#39;t invade Ukraine, the people of Crimea voted overwhelmingly to join Russia. Maybe they all wanted to join Russia because they saw that the neo-nazi puppet leaders that were put in place in Kiev by the US state department would be nothing but trouble, and partly because their pensions would double over night.  There was no invasion, that&#39;s just another example of the horrible journalism done by the western media.  </p>

I have heard about underground cities that are designed to hold ten of thousands of people for many years and are completely sealed off from the surface world.

<p>For a better understanding of Great Game foreign Policy, read Brzezinski&#39;s 1996 &quot;The Grand Chessboard&quot;.  Basically the issue for these guys (most of who are from eastern european communist countries) is that Asia represents totalitarianism and is the natural order in the east.  The danger of Asian (which includes Asiatic Russian) influence moving into eastern europe (as in soviet bloc) is that it will very likely spread to western europe.  east asia/ the middle east and africa are all just colonial proxies to fight this war for world order.  </p>

<p>Iran isn&#39;t a threat because of its nuclear ambitions, it&#39;s a threat because of its influence in the middle east, resistance to western influence and potential to ally with BRICS. </p>

<p>Except he is the Commander in Chief of the U.S military, so he certainly does make decisions, and, in this case, he made the decision that the American military won&#39;t attack Assad despite the warmongering from Republicans such as McCain.</p>

<p>The consistent problem here, the &quot;Matrix,&quot; so to say, is neoliberal interventionism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;De-elite&quot; the elite.</p>

<p>a marxist idea of removing the ruling class through <em>liquidation</em> of them <em>as a class</em> is actually an interesting idea.</p>

<p>No, I&#39;m not talking about Gulags or Pol Pot&#39;s Killing Fields.</p>

<p>I mean, the removal of the means which generate the inequality which creates the ruling class and elite, and gives them the ability to own everything. Abolishing the ability for one man to own huge enterprises, huge tracts of land, huge fortunes in the millions or billions. </p>

<p>All of this of course can be debated on what the limits ought to be. But the global elite, the richest of the rich, run the political parties, and therefore, run the foreign and domestic policies of the countries. We can see what happens if politicians and people don&#39;t march to the tune of the rich elite. In the US, the rich will just lobby and finance other competing candidates. An innocent example looks like the Koch brothers and their ability to generate an entire wing within a political party which is loyal to the interests, and back political change in the interest of the Koch brothers.</p>

<p>To liquidate a class, is to take away their toys. It is scary to many non-socialists on this board. I can understand that. but it is interesting that when you take hte fortunes away from, say, the Koch brothers, you end up with two regular guys, who, just like the rest of us, have to work for a living, for rent and food.</p>

<p>Of course, that wealth and our productive strength can be doing so much more for our communities. Instead, the ruling elite would rather have our productive strength used for war, so that some gas company owners can make more profits by controlling world markets on fossil fuels.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a lot to digest.</p>

<p>Essentially, words are alchemy. Certain words have certain vibrations and by accepting constructs of these words (letters, sentences, grammar, syntax) you are effectively &quot;spelling&quot; and when they are constructed in a certain way, they can have you consenting to being a fictitious entity (aka a person owned by the corporations which mask as governments).</p>

<p>When you trace back the origins of most of the countries you find they&#39;re founded upon maritime admiralty law, and have to basically establish themselves as a subsidiary corporate entity from an over ruling authority. This all traces back up to the crown and the vatican as the ultimate holder of temporal and spiritual power in the world.</p>

<p>Look into some of Jordan Maxwell&#39;s work on this. I wouldn&#39;t take everything he says as true but it&#39;s certainly an interesting take on how we use symbols to reinforce and replicate certain reactions/responses in people. </p>

<p>Andrew Bartzis has a lot of info about the intergalactic commerce that&#39;s being conducted on the planet. Essentially a giant smuggling operation of human DNA to take to other parts of the universe.</p>

<p>The hidden hand interview with an alleged ruling blood line priest on wanttoknow.info also does a good job of painting the overall picture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The ISIS situation smells fishy but there are o may different roads to go down on the theory and it&#39;s hard to understand which might be the most accurate. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Road 1: What Assad was saying in 2010 at the initial onset of the Arab spring is true: The Arab spring was a false grassroots movement perpetuated by the CIA or at least heavily instigated by the CIA. ISIS is phase 2 of the plan. They are a puppet army used to topple regimes in the middle east. Every act they commit is in line with the grand plan of the CIA (I&#39;m not pretending to know every player in this game so i&#39;m just using CIA)</p></li>
<li><p>Road 2: The Arab spring was a false grassroots movement perpetuated by the CIA or at least heavily instigated by the CIA. CIA had every intention of ONLY arming the FSA and moderate groups but money and arms trickled down to extremist factions that grew out of control and into the monster we call ISIS...</p></li>
<li><p>Road 3: The Arab spring revolutions including Syria were all completely &quot;legitimate&quot;. Al-Quada fighters from Iraq and Afganistan retreated from those fronts to join the fights in Libya and Syria, giving the US the impression that they &quot;won&quot; the Afghanistan and Iraq wars due to a decrease in insurgents. ISIS = Al-quada with a new name.. US literally gives weapons and money to Al-quada to fight Assad. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>I dont feel like writing anymore but their are so many slight alternative possibilities to each narrative. All with different levels of deliberateness from the west.. One big question I have though is... Who is the free Syrian army, who were the Armies fighting Qhadaffi? I know percentages of the gov&#39;s armies defected but it doesnt make sense that trained fighters suddenly organized so fast. It&#39;s highly likely to me that the &quot;battle ready&quot; Al-quada insurgents and hired mercenary groups heavily were involved in the fighting at a suspiciously early stage in both those wars. (it&#39;s phrased awkwardly but i&#39;m tired)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1 - Good question. I think the reason is that the religious extremism is a <em>benefit</em>, not a bad thing, because it causes the soldiers to be more motivated. Suicide bombers are always the religious ones, after all. Few really want to get themselves killed over a nationalistic war, the guys like the FSA just want their paycheck and to go home safe to their families. Not true with the religious extremists, they are <em>very</em> motivated. For the US/Israel, it&#39;s just a matter of pointing that religious anger at the right enemies. <a href="https://pietervanostaeyen.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/2000px-syria-15.png">Also I think it is a geographical thing, in part.</a></p>

<p>I once heard an interview with an intelligence agency guy where he said that 1 religious extremist was as good a fighter as 10 hired soldiers of the state. They ran in to this problem in Iraq, where the US-trained Iraqi soldiers couldn&#39;t stand up to the Taliban because the Taliban had such deep motivations and thus were much better fighters. </p>

<p>2 - I think this is totally possible. I think the US/Israel supports the FSA, Al Qaeda, and ISIS. Each to varying degrees in different capacities. It&#39;s a multi-pronged approach. I think it&#39;s likely the US/Israel have moved goods between factions. If they tell one faction to leave it in a field and abandon it, then tell another faction where to go pick it up, then the different factions don&#39;t even have to know that they&#39;re interacting with each other. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s quite this compartmentalized, but it seems possible. </p>

<p>There&#39;s also the possibility there are arms coming from the US/Israel via Turkey or Iraq, same as where the ISIS oil is going. They obviously have some sort of trade relationship, and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if that was used as a way to deliver goods to ISIS. </p>

<p>Like those Toyota Hilux trucks the department of defense gave... I think a lot of those went through Saudi Arabia, who sent them to Iraq, who &quot;lost&quot; them to ISIS, who moved them to Syria. That&#39;s why there was that one story about the ISIS truck having the logo on the side that was a business from Texas. The route has to be convoluted so the people doing it don&#39;t get implicated, so they can hide their crimes more easily. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But it does matter, it really does matter man. </p>

<p>You understand why Kerry is saying this in this particular context, yes? </p>

<p>He is repeating a standard DOD interpretation of the 2001 Authorization of the Use of Military Force against Terrorists that provides the administration the legal cover to fight &quot;Al-Qaeda, the Taliban and associated forces&quot; in the middle east broadly, rather than Afghanistan alone. This enables the administration to continue to justify military operations in Yemen, Syria, Libya etc etc etc without requiring further congressional oversight or debate. </p>

<p>For that reason, you shouldn&#39;t be at all surprised by the fact that John Kerry is suggesting they are &quot;associated&quot; - and let&#39;s be clear here, that is the language he uses, not that they are &quot;one and the same.&quot; What would REALLY be shocking is if he said one of these groups was not &quot;associated&quot; to Al-Qaeda, because then America would actually have a congressional debate about some of these military actions taking place, and then the American congress might actually have to do something (not fucking likely though).  </p>

<p>If you want to draw a lesson out of this, I&#39;ll tell you the lesson you should draw: 
This is a case study in why authorizations of military force should always be time-limited, rather than mission limited. Whenever you have a document that says, essentially, you can kill as many people as you want and go to war wherever you want so long as you do so in the name of fighting &quot;group x (or even more vaguely, groups &#39;associated&#39; to group x,&quot; pretty fucking soon you&#39;ll be seeing &quot;groups associated to group x&quot;  popping up ALLLLLLLLLLL over the damn place. </p>

<p>Just to re-iteration, Kerry is not saying that Al-Nusra/Al-Qaeda/ISIL/ISIS are the exact same organization. Yes, ISIS stemmed from Al-Qaeda, that is a matter of public record. Everyone also knows that the two are now bitter ideological enemies, mostly over ISIS&#39;s claims of control over Al-Qaeda in Syria (among other major issues). </p>

<p>To say that Kerry says they are the exact same thing is disingenuous on a number of fronts, mostly: a) overlooking the political context in which he is speaking, and which he explicitly foregrounds b) overlooking the reality on the ground c) and misrepresenting what he is saying. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>The US isn&#39;t using a &quot;&#39;funneling&#39; bombing strategy&quot; -- most of their airstrikes have been committed to CAS in coordination with the YPG. That is why Daesh is being driven south from Rojava, not westward towards SAA areas.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>These erroneous air drops do not keep happening -- that is a myth. There were two incidents that I know occurred, one in Syria and one in Iraq, which have been conflated to the US dropping supplies to Daesh on a regular basis.</p>

<p>My views are based on facts on the ground, which I read about via various sources on a daily basis. </p>

<p>For example, here is a map that shows the advances that the US-allied YPG have made against ISIS (Daesh), which demonstrates two observations: (1) Daesh is being pushed southward and not westward towards SAA-controlled areas despite your &quot;funneling&quot; claims; and (2) YPG areas actually include districts that the regime still controls because the YPG aren&#39;t fighting against Assad (though Rojava still wants autonomy).</p>

<p>There are many different newspapers and TV programs, so we all have to parse through whatever media that we watch and make our own decisions to what may be occurring in world or local events. Mass media isn&#39;t monolithic nor consistent. </p>

<p>The internet is wrong.</p>

<p>There are many different websites that disseminate information, so we all have to judge what we think is closer to the truth.</p>

<p>Every commonly known fact about the conflict s the diametric opposite of the truth according to you. Sorry I don&#39;t have that much faith in your opinion.</p>

<p>You haven&#39;t even demonstrated the basis for your <em>opinion.</em> All you can do is make claims that aren&#39;t based upon any commonly agreed &quot;truths,&quot; because I can easily show you Wikipedia articles that back-up everything I just said, such as this article on Rojava and US-backed forces there: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Kurdish%E2%80%93Islamist_conflict_(2013%E2%80%93present)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Kurdish%E2%80%93Islamist_conflict_(2013%E2%80%93present)</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>She is talking about the well-known American, anti-Soviet support of the mujaheddin, some of whom went on to form al-Qaeda, or <em>The base.</em> The Taliban (who had support from the ISI and the CIA, to a degree) are a different, more regional organization than al-Qaeda (which is why the Taliban are considered an armed insurgency, and not a terrorist, group, by the U.S.).</p>

<p>Al-Nusra came from al-Qaeda in Iraq, which arose in 2004 in Iraq against the US occupation there. According to your suggestion, though, the U.S. was funding an opposition group against itself as it was occupying Iraq, which is an unrealistic suggestion with no clear benefit for the U.S.</p>

<p>It must be noted that al-Qaeda in Iraq launched attacks from Syria into Iraq since the Assad regime tolerated their existence since they (and their Shiite Iranian allies) were attacking the Americans as well. That&#39;s the reason why al-Qaeda/al-Nusra had a foot in the door even before the Arab Spring arose against the regime. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the lesson, I appreciate it. </p>

<p>My one quibble is that it&#39;s important not to discount the possibility that two opposing sides can be funded by the same group. The war itself is what generates profits, not the control of the region, per se. They can sell to both sides. The US is the #1 arms exporter in the world, why wouldn&#39;t they rather have 2 markets instead of 1? The instability in Iraq serves the military-industrial complex, it is profitable. There&#39;s your benefit for the US.</p>

<p>In the same way it seems like Zionists may control the both sides of the Russia/China vs US/Europe/Saudi conflict, the US can control both sides of the Al-Nusra vs Iraq conflict. </p>

<p>But just because war is profitable doesn&#39;t mean the war can be in an infinite stalemate. The war still has tides and the waves must be ridden, so it&#39;s not just 100% scripted from the top-down, they have to use the relationships and animosities available to pit factions against each other to achieve their means.</p>

<p>Basically, there&#39;s no reason they can&#39;t sell guns/rockets/trucks/etc to the losing side. That&#39;s a market too. This also gives them  more control over the conflict because they have the ability to take those things away if they want, so they can essentially collapse one faction&#39;s economy at will and change the direction of the war. They can push it more toward a stalemate or more toward a one-sided battle situation, depending on what best accomplishes their current geopolitical and profit goals. </p>

<p>For example, the banks want to install a central bank in Syria quickly. They want the war to be over and Assad gone quickly as possible. But the bomb companies want the war to last as long as possible, to sell the most bombs. So there is a conflict within the military-industrial complex. Same with the reconstruction companies and oil companies vs the tanks and trucks and guns industry. Some want the war over so they can get their hands on the resources or markets and start selling, but other parts of the military-industrial complex want the war to last forever. So there are various tensions at play between sub-factions within the military-industrial complex, that determine the speed and intensity of the war. </p>

<p>Sure, totally, that&#39;s always a possibility, but the U.S. arms manufacturers were making a killing just be selling to the American military, which made members of Congress happy whenever their district got a new weapons plant or some such. I also certainly agree that the military-industrial complex favored the war and pushed it via the Bush administration, especially with Dick Cheney in place (as the Downing Street memo mentions) &quot;fixing the facts&quot; to support the cause for war. </p>

<p>My own quibble here is with the idea that the Americans were knowingly supporting al-Qaeda in Iraq because American militarists are still very patriotic. Sure, they want to make billions of dollars by selling tanks, but they can happily do it through the Pentagon (and its half a trillion dollar DOD budget) while also kicking A-rab ass and waving the Stars and Stripes. &#39;Merica. </p>

<p>The Syrian civil war is way too complex for any one or two or even three factions to control. American or Israeli intelligence just aren&#39;t that expansive or capable. Here is a post I recently wrote that briefly describe most of the sides here:
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3vwryz/isis_is_a_tool_of_western_governments_to/cxs7ioe">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3vwryz/isis_is_a_tool_of_western_governments_to/cxs7ioe</a></p>

<p>We also have to consider what the public or factions within each of these countries opine on the Syrian civil war, e.g., Republicans in America calling Obama a &quot;pussy&quot; since they believe he should be doing more. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I agree. Many of these interests are nonstate arms dealers.</p>

<p>There is a good book called <em>In Search of Enemies</em> that describes CIA operations in Africa from an intelligence chief that was intimately involved, and he describes how field operations are often extremely difficult work with little money at hand and few personnel involved (meaning that their reputations often proceeds their abilities):
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/In-Search-Enemies-CIA-Story/dp/0393009262">http://www.amazon.com/In-Search-Enemies-CIA-Story/dp/0393009262</a></p>

</blockquote>

<p>I agree with the sentiments behind your post, but I believe we have to consider all the competing interests at hand and whether one side or the other has the reach, the funds, the personnel, and the connections to accomplish their goals. </p>

<p>Syria is going to be a big mess, and while some groups may see a profit in rebuilding infrastructure, in loan programs (WTO), and so forth, it will be a messy situation, and I don&#39;t know if the profit will be there except for particular industries. War doesn&#39;t guarantee a profit so there are always more stable ways to make money than conflict (unless you sell bullets and troop transports).</p>

<p>Remember how people said the U.S. went into Iraq for oil? Well, the Americans never got any of it -- the Chinese won a lot of contracts and much of it has been transported through Turkey -- so we always have to keep a skeptical mind when it comes this topic, because we can often look back events more clearly like we can with the Iraqi war and occupation (which cost American public trillions of dollars at this point).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post, you bring up some interesting points. I don&#39;t think the intelligence agencies are as incapable as you portray them, but on the other hand I think you are correct in saying their reputation proceeds their abilities. They have spent a lot of money and effort cultivating the image that they&#39;re all-knowing and all-powerful, so a lot of it is exaggeration. But they <em>are</em> overthrowing countries&#39; governments on the regular, so they deserve to be taken quite seriously. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I think in this statement you are neglecting the concept of compartmentalization. I don&#39;t think the American troops in Iraq were knowingly supporting Al Qaeda. I think they just often left things in the desert, at certain locations, without being told why. And then later the arms dealers, pretending to be something other than the US, tell Al Qaeda where to pick it up. That way no one in the military or Al Qaeda has to know what is going on. They will find it strange, and say it makes no sense, but few will actually piece it together, and even fewer will talk about it.  </p>

<p>Compartmentalization is the means by which the two atomic bombs dropped on Japan were produced. There was a city that had 40,000 people in it making these two bombs, and only a few hundred or less actually had any idea what they were making. One guy just made gears, another lady just did wiring according to the diagrams, and so on. No one person was given information on what the project was. This is compartmentalization. You can pull off grand conspiracies involving thousands of people if you just strictly limit the information each individual receives. </p>

<p>Anyway, I think it&#39;s easy for the US to be supporting both sides without either side knowing they&#39;re supporting the other. It&#39;s just more profitable, and this nation and its owners driven by profit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, fuck.</p>

<p>Many people are positing that it&#39;s the start of World War 3. Is Russia threatened enough by ISIS, and if not, are they so protective of the regimes they support that they would be willing to start a war over it? Both countries know that one nuke dropped would equate to an all-out, winner-take-all final round. Without any real understanding of how close Russia is to the NWO, would this be a disastrous scenario, or could it be by design?</p>

<p>No doubt this is the craziest geopolitical revelation in some of our lifetimes. I&#39;ve been very critical of doomsdayers but I can no longer say I feel comfortable living here when not only the Russian powers are growing resentful of the West while our own government is perpetuating terrorism and stripping their citizens of their rights.</p>

<p>Obama says we&#39;re in a war against ISIS.<br/>
ISIS is in Syria fighting the elected government of Syria.
ISIS is our stated enemy who is fighting a war in Syria.
HOWEVER, Obama tells us our goal in Syria is not to defeat ISIS, but to overthrow the elected government of Syria, Bashar al-Assad.
Russia is in Syria right now dropping bombs on ISIS.</p>

<p>ISIS is our enemy.  Russia and Syria are fighting ISIS in Syria.  However, President Obama says our goal in Syria is to overthrow the government of Assad, NOT defeating ISIS.  We&#39;re not talking to the Russians or Assad on how to defeat ISIS because our goal in Syria is to overthrow Assad.  But remember, we need to stop ISIS immediately.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I offer an alternate explanation for why why ISIS got its hands on US financed non-military equipment so easily.  It has more to do with public sentiment about the war in Iraq within the United States, and elections, than it has to do with some conspiracy, in which the US and Israel are supporting ISIS.<br/>
With the lack of public support for the continued war in Iraq, there was a big push for lawmakers to come up with an exit strategy.  Despite the fact that militarily and politically the country may not have been ready for such a withdrawal.  Nevertheless, with politicians worrying about the next election cycle, cave to public pressure and pull troops out.  The public doesn&#39;t want our soldiers dying over there but they are fine with spending billions on defense equipment for the recently established democracy.<br/>
When we pulled our military out , the void was created, ISIS gained strength, and easily overrun the poorly trained Iraq military, and stole the equipment we supplied them with.  This was not because we wanted to supply ISIS with weapons and vehicles.  It is because politicians were forced by there public to make a difficult choice in the region.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate your view on how complicated international politics are. My only question is what interest does the US have in destabalizing the middle east? Where&#39;s the money? The only interest i see is in the far right hoping to set off armageddon, but Obama&#39;s in office. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your response is really condescending. That isn&#39;t neccesary. Put your measuring tape and edick away.</p>

<p>I disagree that you think party politics has nothing to do with decision making. A president backed by conservatives is going to make decisions more aligned with neoconservative think tanks such as the heritage foundation, a liberal one more aligned with liberal think tanks. And yes, despite this both parties are coopted by the same corporate donors, banks, and international interests. I am aware of this.</p>

<p>Also the idea that America is something I assumed os ridiculous. In your own response you mention various other countries without identifying them as ideas. These countries, corporations, and think tanks all come together to form the international system... which the US created and has the most leverage over. </p>

<p>But besides that, where does the idea of this international deisgn of a Sunni superstate come from? And how do you reconcile that with the fact that we pulled out of Iraq?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent post! Good work on narrowing down the issues, but also addressing the disconnect that people seem to have. I&#39;ve been talking about these issues with people I see socially, and when you bring this stuff up, they know there&#39;s something wrong, but they can&#39;t bring themselves to really see it. It&#39;s like, where&#39;s the &quot;snooze button&quot;? They just want to get back to sleep. I can see why. Orwell didn&#39;t coin the &quot;Ignorance is bliss&quot; slogan for nothing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think  you are right. The politicians give off such a nice impression, they seem like such reasonable and caring people. But then they turn around and commit war crimes without even blinking. Most Americans never meet a psychopath like this in their day to day lives, so they have a hard time believing there are really people like that out there. Americans give those politicians the benefit of the doubt, over and over and over, even when it has become absolutely clear that we shouldn&#39;t. </p>

<p>We <em>want</em> to trust people, that is our natural state, and that is the very thing that is abused by the powers that be, who are culturally trained and marry selectively to ignore this natural state for maximum personal profit. Extremely high-functioning psychopaths generally run the world. People really need to wake up to this fact, and realize it&#39;s not at all a joke or an hyperbolic overstatement either. It&#39;s the true reality, these people meet the clinical definition of psychopaths in the DSM V, but they have so much power no one will ever say the emperor has no clothes, everyone is too concerned with gaining power. So people suck up to them, change for them, and eventually become psychopaths themselves. It is our greed for power that puts us in this trap of subservience, and our trust of authority that keeps us there.  </p>

These are the same people who refuse to believe that we funded and trained the Taliban. All I can say is the film &quot;Idoicracy&quot; was basically art imitating life. Seriously though, the thought process of many Americans is terrifying. How the fuck did a civilization come to this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Show them the all the articles I linked to in my original post. Then they won&#39;t be able to deny it as easily. </p>

<p>I agree, it&#39;s like some people are allergic to things that might alter their world view. I see this as a symptom of emotional fragility, they are scared that your ideas might bring up overwhelming negative emotions. So they call you a loon instead of think about facts! It&#39;s quite absurd. I know lots of people like this too. Just show them the articles, and stick to the facts as much as possible. Remove any opinion from the discussion if possible, that just gives them denial-ammo. </p>

<p>You&#39;re probably having more an effect then you realize, too. They might outwardly say things like this but then secretly be googling about it and wondering themselves. Maybe 2 years down the road one of them might come to you and say &quot;wow, you were right&quot;. Give people the tools to undergo a mental transformation, the raw facts, and then give them space to connect the facts. This is how Noam Chomsky does it, and this is how I try to do it. A short sequence of smartly laid-out facts is the best way to make your case. The right facts <em>will</em> make them draw the right inferences eventually, just communicate a fact at a time. </p>

<p>Also, you have to not care if you lose this battle. Some people are just legit idiots who will never wake up. Most people, probably. So try your best, but also let it go after you have said your piece. Don&#39;t get stuck on trying to convince one individual person, just lay out the facts and if people are receptive they will pay attention. If they are not receptive, you couldn&#39;t have convinced them anyway. </p>

<p>I wonder how civilization got to this point too. I think essentially Americans were domesticated through excessive comforts, is basically what happened. </p>

The only group the CIA,directly supported was massouds Tajik rebels by giving him a little bit of dosh each month. The rest of the funding and stingers was given to the ISI, and distributed into various mujahideen groups, a large amount being Pashtun, and a little amount being Tajik, Uzbek, Persian, Arab. 
Hekmatyars received quite a bit of Gear from the ISI. After the democratic party of Afghanistan fell, Afghanistan fell into chaos, blah blah , the Taliban was formed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is fairly easy to understand. The people of the US have been brainwashed, propagandized, and misinformed/disinformed from the day they were born. They get it from the general culture, TV, and the education/indoctrination system. Humans only have 2 sources of information: 1. things which they have directly experienced themselves and 2. things they are told (regardless of the media used). 1 is extremely limited. 2 is filled with lies. </p>

<p>For myself personally, it takes a great deal of time and effort to make sense of world events and even now I am not 100% sure of what is the truth and what is false. I know that the mass media and the government cannot be trusted, but I also know that more independent sources also often have an axe to grind and do not provide full coverage/understanding either. Still, if you spend the time and effort, you can come close to the truth most of the time. Most people do not have the time or means to do so. </p>

Also you&#39;re blaming the US when it looks as if Australia has been missing over 800 vehicles. 
  &quot;Questions about the ISIS use of Toyota vehicles have circulated for years. In 2014, a report by the radio broadcaster Public Radio International noted that the U.S. State Department delivered 43 Toyota trucks to Syrian rebels. A more recent report in an Australian newspaper said that more than 800 of the trucks had been reported missing in Sydney between 2014 and 2015, and quoted terror experts speculating that they may have been exported to ISIS territory. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we have different competing interests there with various state and nonstate actors:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Americans, driven by neoliberal interventionist ideals. I will place Western nations here, too, though they aren&#39;t a unified front. </li>
<li>The Gulf states supporting Wahhabi groups for ideological or national interests.</li>
<li>The various Islamist groups, who vary in ideological differences and goals. There are dozens of these organizations here, larger operation rooms and umbrella groups, such as al-Nusra and the Islamic Front, who are major names with tens of thousands of fighters.</li>
<li>Daesh, ISIS, or the Islamic State, as its own faction (though there have been overlaps between it and other groups) due to its size and numerical army size.</li>
<li>Various FSA groups, again, varying in ideologies and goals. Some are more secular, some are more theocratic, and they all have different alliances and connections. There are dozens of these groups as well (though they have tended to merge together into larger organizations as the war has continued).</li>
<li>Turkey, their objectives, and the groups they support (such as Turkmen fighters). There is evidence that they are supporting al-Nusra and Daesh, but that will have to be 100% proven if true. </li>
<li>The Kurds: The YPG/YPJ, the SDF (including Arab and Christian militias), and Rojava. </li>
<li>Anti-Daesh (ISIS) groups generally allied with the YPG.</li>
<li>The CIA, which is acting as a somewhat independent actor. </li>
<li>The Israelis, who seem to be supporting Salafist elements in southern Syria. Despite what people may claim, they aren&#39;t major players in this conflict. They are mostly concerned about Hezbollah and preserving their northern defenses and the Golan Heights. </li>
<li>The Assad regime with Iranian, Russian, Hezbollah allies, and all the groups, the SAA, the NDF, Alawite, Christian, and other paramilitaries or militias who all have their goals (some of which could be in conflict).</li>
</ul>

<p>The Syrian civil war is one of the most complex modern conflicts in postwar history, which is why I am very resistant to the idea that any one faction is actually controlling everything because there are so many moving parts involved. Add in the Iraqi portion of this extended conflict, and it gets even messier.</p>

<p>The issue isn&#39;t facts, the issue is the interpretation of facts. If you are right, you need to demonstrate that the plausibility of your worldview significantly exceeds that of competing interpretations of the world. To do <em>that</em>, you&#39;ll need to undertake a survey of all those worldviews, and discover the errors in them, and independently establish their failures of plausibility... but that is a lot to learn about!

<p>Your commitment to challenging yourself would thus appear to be rather limited. lol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah,  but ISIS is small time,  smaller time than North Korea for example.    </p>

<p>The efforts to overthrow Assad have ebbed and flowed over the last 4-5 years.   There have been times,   followed by much frenzy by McCain and Kerry,   when the Assad opposition was nearly wiped out.    Don&#39;t forget that in failed states like Iraq and Libya,  the oil still flows.    Officially,  no US propped up dictator for the US to be accountable for.</p>

<p>Lets face it,   the US is happy for Libya and Iraq to be failed states,   and is planning for Syria and Iran to be then next ones.  </p>

<p>By the way,   do you think that US government policy is trying to improve the state of the US regarding public education,   prisons,  etc?    No,   the US is being turned into a place where the government the public interfaces with is less competent.     On the other hand,  the pathways of corruption and corporate welfare,   though invisible,  are extremely effective.   And the lifestyle of the super rich and their exclusive infrastructure such as private jet travel,   gated enclaves,  etc.  is in top condition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>America didn&#39;t need an apocalypse cult to oust Assad.  The President decided interference in the rebellion wouldn&#39;t lead to anything good.  Because interfering in Middle East politics is what causes things like Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and Daesh.  They have American shit because for the past 40 years the US has been supporting rebels in that area to influence politics on our behalf.  And each fucking time when we get our mission accomplished, those same rebels who&#39;ve been trained for war turn on us because we manipulated them.</p>

<p>So Obama decided not to interfere this time, and ISIL took the opportunity of a lack of (heavy) external influence to expand their faux Caliphate.</p>

<p>The ISIL will never be recognized by any country, if the USA wants to overthrow Assad, investing into a radical group which is obviously worse than the government, they want to overthrow, is absolutely the worst option. Investing into a moderate group that they (and the rest of the NATO) can openly support would be the best.</p>

<p>The ISIL just - in fact - makes Assad look good and is a perfect excuse for Russia to bomb everyone else, because &quot;Hey, look at how bad is the Islamic State, Assad was much better and the rest doesn&#39;t have the power to keep Syria stable&quot;.</p>

<p>There&#39;s literally not a single compelling piece of evidence. Not one. Everything about DAESH points to the same concept: a loosely connected group of Muslims who want to establish a new Caliphate and have no regard for human life. The links you bring as &quot;facts&quot; are garbage and show nothing unless you&#39;re looking at a picture of a duck, willing yourself to see a rabbit.</p>

<p>I mean seriously, what are your big proofs? That they didn&#39;t attack Israel? Kind of hard to do when they&#39;re hundreds of miles away and Israel is super paranoid about Arabs coming through their borders. That they drive American trucks? Oh, you mean the same ones that were stolen from the Iraqi forces as stated right there in the article you linked? Israel buys their oil? Not according to the sources you linked, Israel buys <em>Kurdish</em> oil but DAESH <em>may</em> use the Kurdish-Turkish oil pipeline to smuggle and sell their own stuff.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, you bring <em>Putin</em> in as a shining example of telling the truth. This is the same guy who denied sending troops in to the Ukraine until it was completely under Russian control, now simply pretends that he never denied it.</p>

<p>Israel admits wounded anonymous Syrians (who are mostly from Al Nusra and FSA, but definitely not DAESH) into Israeli hospitals.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t know who and what they are. Membership in the various groups seems rather fluid. That Israel admits to helping al Nusra shows that Israel will admittedly help al Qaeda. All bets are off after that. </p>

<p>I disagree. The real contradiction here is Israel&#39;s aid to al Qaeda/ISIS.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a question of whether or not you agree or disagree, the title and text of this thread explicitly points out that Israel and the US created and now controls ISIS. You are clearly disagreeing with the second part, but then you say that you agree with the thread!</p>

<p>Furthermore I&#39;m not sure how much clearer I can make this: <strong>There is not a shred of evidence that Israel created the so-called Islamic State</strong>. In our entire argument, you have yet to bring a single fact to the contrary.</p>

<p>Humanitarian aid to a small number of individual fighters for a splinter group that hates DAESH (it&#39;s mostly FSA members, not Al Nusra) in return for intelligence. Said fighters never actually return to fight. Hardly &quot;aid and comfort&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It calls Israel&#39;s armed forces a &quot;500-pound gorilla in Israel. Well armed and trained...Known to disregard international law to accomplish mission. Very unlikely to fire on American forces. Fratricide a concern especially in air space management.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, now we have a baseline to work with, thank you.</p>

<p>First off, that directly contradicts what you said earlier:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That doesn&#39;t mean that I think that Israel &quot;controls&quot; ISIS</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now you&#39;re telling me it&#39;s &quot;within the realm of possibility&quot;. Whatever, we can still work with this.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not within the realm of possibility, it&#39;s in the realm of fantasy. DAESH supporters are fanatically anti-America, anti-Israel, and anti-Jewish. There is simply no way they would be OK with working with Mossad. Futhermore, DAESH is a huge, multifaceted, uncontrollable organization. There isn&#39;t even a clear leadership hierarchy in many parts of it. There certainly isn&#39;t some Israeli at the top giving orders to everyone below.</p>

<p>Second, it&#39;s also within the realm of possibility that Japan controls DAESH. Also Burma. And North Korea. If you&#39;re going to use a quote of Mossad&#39;s ruthlessness as your &quot;evidence&quot; you&#39;re going to have to also look at everything else that would qualify as evidence under those (very very loose) grounds. </p>

<p>Finally, it&#39;s a fact that the DAESH philosophy is very popular among young, troubled Muslims in the region (and the rest of the world). Why is it so difficult to believe that people with similar dangerous beliefs acted on said beliefs and started a terrorist organization?</p>

<p>That is absolutely rubbish. You haven&#39;t even been following the Syrian civil war, have you? Because here is a map that shows the gains over the last year (not two years), colored in yellow and circled with &quot;ISIS LOSES,&quot; which the YPG, with the US air support, have made against Daesh.</p>

<p>Another map of US-YPG gains against Daesh: <a href="https://imagopyrenaei.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/rojava-2014-20151.png">https://imagopyrenaei.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/rojava-2014-20151.png</a></p>

<p>No other faction in the civil war, including the SAA and Russia (who has spent a lot of time bombing the FSA) has made as many gains as the YPG-American alliance against Daesh. </p>
