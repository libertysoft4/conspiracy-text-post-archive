<p>They did. Remember 2008? There is no possible way that all the investment banking industry didn&#39;t know the ramifications of providing unlimited retail credit. The credit bubble was blown and deflated to justify the unprecedented direct looting of the US Treasury, otherwise known as QE. God only knows what sort of criminally corrupt fuckery they will impose upon us when the current bubble blows. </p>

<p>Not sure what bubble you mean, but in my eyes the biggest bubble is that (almost) every country lives with debt and not with real resources. That is a huge bubble and nobody is going to pay back the debt, obviously because it&#39;s impossible. But still they talk about paying it back and how it&#39;s a problem. I&#39;m not very well informed on the situation, but I could guess the loaners that give countries / governments money will stop at some point when the elite wants. The interests need to be paid with more debt so (in my mind at least) at some point it will inevitably become a runaway situation where you need to take more debt exponentially and really fast. Then it will automatically collapse.</p>

<p>Edit: I feel if this is the case how I&#39;m thinking it, it should not be that hard for them to calculate when this extreme runaway situation will happen, and it might have been set a long long time ago.</p>

<p>This is my concern. If you take the average idiot and give them enough information to panic but not enough context, they are now an empowered idiot. I overheard some customers at work talking about the september shit and I sorta butted into the conversation to ask one guy to clarify what he was saying. What does he talk about? How much ammo he has...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The big problem that I see is that now that the prison/circus/distraction machine is starting to burst at the seams and people are slipping through the cracks, there is no map for what happens once they&#39;re outside of it. </p>

<p>If you&#39;ve seen logan&#39;s run, it&#39;s like what happens after you sneak through the utility hallways and avoid the death robot at the exit. Now you&#39;re in the wilderness, and where do you go? Even the rumors about what exist outside of it don&#39;t guide you, there&#39;s no refuge like they said there&#39;d be, so what do you do? It seems for many people the answer is ammo and MREs for their immediate family instead of, I dunno, building community, seed-saving, having a local tool library etc etc. </p>

<p>This guy&#39;s entire plan(that he spoke about anyway) was to put his 20k rounds in his SUV and drive to some place in &quot;the hills&quot; that he knows about. He didn&#39;t mention seeds, or neighbors or really anything other than bugging out with a 24hr plan. There&#39;s too much survival bullshit like that and not enough real solution seeking when I look at the various doom websites. </p>

<p>He sounded pretty convinced of his position and because he was fat, armed and had the benefit of being a younger boomer(thus got paid real money for the same bullshit sort of job), had a baseless self confidence that I didn&#39;t care to challenge. He was not open, he was already an informed expert in his own mind even though it was clear he was new to collapse. I suspect the moment people like that listen is when they&#39;ve run out of ammo and gas and find an intentional community that has already solved these problems. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many people are simply afraid. Afraid of what could happen. Afraid for themselves and their family. They take the &quot;every man for themselves&quot; approach. I agree with you. You are absolutely correct. You&#39;ve got the right idea. Then again, there will be people who want to take what you and your community built because they didn&#39;t take the time to do anything but buy ammo. Ya can&#39;t eat ammo.. I am no &quot;prepper&quot;. I kind of wish I were. If something bad happened I am not prepared. I do however have seeds. A sound mind. A good heart. A good family. Great friends, and I am prepared to be a part of a decent community to rebuild if something terrible happens on a mass scale. That&#39;s what people should be discussing more. Humans, at our core, when afraid, can be quite animalistic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The big problem that I see is that now that the prison/circus/distraction machine is starting to burst at the seams and people are slipping through the cracks, there is no map for what happens once they&#39;re outside of it. </p>

<p>If you&#39;ve seen logan&#39;s run, it&#39;s like what happens after you sneak through the utility hallways and avoid the death robot at the exit. Now you&#39;re in the wilderness, and where do you go? Even the rumors about what exist outside of it don&#39;t guide you, there&#39;s no refuge like they said there&#39;d be, so what do you do? It seems for many people the answer is ammo and MREs for their immediate family instead of, I dunno, building community, seed-saving, having a local tool library etc etc. </p>

<p>This guy&#39;s entire plan(that he spoke about anyway) was to put his 20k rounds in his SUV and drive to some place in &quot;the hills&quot; that he knows about. He didn&#39;t mention seeds, or neighbors or really anything other than bugging out with a 24hr plan. There&#39;s too much survival bullshit like that and not enough real solution seeking when I look at the various doom websites. </p>

<p>He sounded pretty convinced of his position and because he was fat, armed and had the benefit of being a younger boomer(thus got paid real money for the same bullshit sort of job), had a baseless self confidence that I didn&#39;t care to challenge. He was not open, he was already an informed expert in his own mind even though it was clear he was new to collapse. I suspect the moment people like that listen is when they&#39;ve run out of ammo and gas and find an intentional community that has already solved these problems. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, here&#39;s one slightly more objective measure I can propose in the absence of recent opinion polling. Go to <a href="http://trends.google.com">http://trends.google.com</a>. Type in &quot;9/11 truth&quot;. See if there&#39;s absolutely any indication there&#39;s a &quot;surge&quot; of any kind of interest in the field.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/vPsTZBx.jpg">Last I checked</a> it was a solid downward slope with temporary spikes (of decreasing magnitude) on the anniversary.</p>

<p>Of course, maybe Google&#39;s in on it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why are you here? </p>

<p>You sure do spend a lot of time reading and commenting in this sub considering how often you attack the users here and claim this sub is mostly filled with paranoid schizophrenics. If most of the theories and people here are stupid, then why have you spent the last 4 months dedicated towards shitting on this sub? </p>

<p>And if you respond, be sure to side step my question of why are you here while pretending nobody notices </p>
