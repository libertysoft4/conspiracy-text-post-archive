<p>Waking up to the cynical truth about the corrupt, backscratching, revolving door relationships between the FDA (and other agencies) and the Big Pharma and Big Agra industries has been difficult to face, as the problem is so pervasive as to affect the lives of nearly everyone in this country, and beyond throughout the world.</p>

<p>As such, I felt the need to respond to Jon Rappoport’s article, <a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2015/08/18/a-message-to-libertarians-about-the-fda/">“A Message to Libertarians About the FDA,”</a> because it is an issue I have also thought about quite often.</p>

<p>Is it in the interest of a free society who desires limited government and maximum rights to have a tough watchdog who can protect people? After all, even the average citizen is likely familiar with the deadly mistakes and misdeeds of the food and drug industries…</p>

<p>People don’t want dangerous pharmaceuticals being prescribed to them because proper testing wasn’t done; people don’t want their food contaminated with salmonella or e. Coli; many people don’t want GMOs to be allowed at all, and damn sure want a label on food packages in order to know which foods contain them.</p>

<p>But if these are duties of the Food and Drug Administration, then the federal agency has failed over and over and over again, all while protecting those who’ve done wrong and enabling them to do bigger and better business.</p>

<p>The details are part of a long and ongoing saga, but for starters, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/21ZT6rU.png">the overlapping relationships between the FDA and Big Pharma industry look something like this.</a></p>

<p>So what can be done about it? What is the solution to the dilemma?</p>

<p>As it turns out, protecting individual liberty should be the first priority… until those rights are respected, the problem can never improve.</p>

<p>Jon Rappoport writes regularly with great points, and is a dependable staple of good commentary on this crazy, screwed up world.</p>

<p>But, here, he cuts right to the chase on an important question: given that the criminals are in charge, that the fox guards the henhouse, and that the powers that be are fine with foxes eating chickens, how can we stop it? Regulate it? Protect against it?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a half-sane society, the big drug companies would have been prosecuted to the sky long ago. Their charters to do business in any state would have been revoked. Their CEOs, executives, and scientists would have been put behind bars for life. Even a limited federal government would have done that.</p>

<p>Here is where I’m in accord with Libertarians: people have right and the freedom to refuse medication, under any circumstances, even where the experts claim death will be the inevitable outcome. And people have the right to ingest any compounds they decide might help them.</p>

<p>If that were the basis for the system, then government couldn’t overwhelm the population with rules about <a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2015/06/30/mandatory-vaccination-california-is-ordering-genetic-alteration/">mandatory vaccines</a> (see <a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2015/02/25/adult-immunization-push-medical-dictatorship/">also</a>) and drugs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The extreme libertarian argument for no government regulation (via the FDA) isn’t going to happen, even if it would be better; neither can the FDA be reformed to do their job (better or at all) in protecting the people from dangerous drugs and treatments from Big Pharma.</p>

<p>Sad, but true. Utterly and unshakably true.</p>

<p>It would be nice if Big Pharma’s power were checked, and problems stopped before they can do harm. It would be oh-so-nice if the FDA truly looked out for the benefit of people, instead of helping the food and drug industries to become more powerful.</p>

<p>But it just isn’t going to happen.</p>

<p>Truly regrettable. But sorry, it just isn’t going to happen.</p>

<p>Not only is it not realistic – it may be inherently impossible to accomplish.</p>

<p>More and more government – including an Obamacare universal health system – and more “regulation” (look how well the EPA is doing lately) is only compounding these problems and making the corruption and loss of freedom worse. (And no one is getting healthier in the meantime.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In case you hadn’t noticed, all national health insurance plans, in whatever <a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2015/08/11/australia-canada-england-usa-medical-dictatorship/">countries they’ve been established</a>, are the road to perdition, because they can be manipulated to coerce citizens into accepting designated toxic medical treatments.</p>

<p>The freedom of refusal is the only protection when crime bosses rule both government agencies (like the FDA) and pharmaceutical companies.</p>

<p>Trying to reform Pharma or the government is a losing proposition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maintaining the right to refuse is the most important freedom with respect to medical health.</p>

<p>It is the foundation and most important fundamental step.</p>

<p>Any free society of the future, no matter how it chooses to embrace technology and facilitate huge areas and masses of people, must at its core respect the basic freedoms of individuals.</p>

<p>Any free society of the future must begin with the Bill of Rights – and recognize medical freedom as part of those essential rights (under a proper interpretation of the spirit of these rights, medical freedom is included, but unfortunately not explicitly cited).</p>

<p>Medical freedom means the right to choose what you will put into your body, and the right NOT to be forced to take drugs or medicine even if other people believe it will save lives.</p>

<p>Mandatory vaccines for school children, <a href="http://truthstreammedia.com/2015/01/09/government-is-forcing-deadly-chemo-treatments-on-children/">forced chemotherapy treatments for independent teenagers</a> and <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/22/amish-chemo_n_4643363.html">Amish children</a> – against the will of the child and/or parents – is absolutely wrong, and only heralds the arrival of greater tyranny against all of our health rights.</p>

<p>Dr. Benjamin Rush, an influential but lesser known founding father and medical doctor, saw this issue clearly as well.</p>

<p>Rush, who corresponded with President George Washington and many other founders of the day, wrote letters warning that medical freedom must be protected under the Constitution… or else, tyranny is basically inevitable.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/034892_Benjamin_Rush_medical_freedom_Constitution.html#">He said:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unless we put medical freedom into the Constitution, the time will come when medicine will organize into an undercover dictatorship to restrict the art of healing to one class of Men and deny equal privileges to others; the Constitution of the Republic should make a Special privilege for medical freedoms as well as religious freedom.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This sentiment is of paramount importance, and desperately needs to be revisited.</p>

<p>Forcing down the medicine is obviously not the sign of a healthy and free society.</p>

<p>And the medical ‘right to refuse’ is an individual nullification that can deliver a powerful blow to corrupt power by the system.</p>

<p>These chemicals are transferred through breast milk. <a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-08/hsop-bme081715.php">http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-08/hsop-bme081715.php</a></p>

<p>Either they aren&#39;t aware of perfluorinated alkylates, which means they are uninformed morons, or they don&#39;t care, which means they simply have a control fetish for telling people what to do. Either scenario is terrible. </p>

<p>A third scenario could be that a significant percentage of vaccine conversation online is paid for and they are instructed to not step on the toes of the huge amount of corporations which are responsible for poisoning everybody with these chemicals. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ignorance is not idiocy. Frankly, there are so many (thousands) of toxic and potentially toxic chemicals in our better living through chemistry world that it&#39;s impossible to be aware of all of them. I didn&#39;t know about this particular one, and I feel like I am paying more attention than the majority of apathetic people.</p>

<p>As regards the modern climate of internet posting substituting for real debate (what I admit I do with too much of my time), there&#39;s bound to be a myriad of reasons why any given person takes a certain position. I am betting that much of it is propaganda and the extra noise comes from people (with or without a control fetish, but with an emotional stake in the debate) who are arguing solely based on the provided talking points. It creates a polemic climate where any useful and actually interesting points like what you&#39;ve raised are ignored for the impassioned us vs them flame wars that humans, by design, love to engage in.  </p>

<p>In a perfect world, the actual shill organization(s) would adopt this into their talking points nationwide simply because they would be benefiting humanity, but I think most of us know this won&#39;t happen. The people who have an emotional stake in the debate would help humanity by talking about this, but again, I doubt that would happen. I&#39;m expecting very few actual honest people in this debate to discuss things like this. If these people actually cared about children, I would be able to click a &quot;pro vaccine&quot; user on here and see 10-20 times as many posts on school lunches and stuff like that. It seems that most people simply want the child alive. They don&#39;t care if its fat sick and dying, as long as it survives a few viral diseases, then we technically &quot;saved lives.&quot; </p>

<p>So, what you see above is basically me already assuming what I&#39;m pretty sure to be true: Nobody cares, and most people are parrots. The bulk of this debate is nonsense, so I&#39;m just going to call people retards until they start discussing the real issues. Hopefully some of the parrots pick up my points and spread them around. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or, perhaps I mean that Western medicine has brought us incredible benefits, increased our life-expectancy by huge amounts in last 50 to 100 years, almost wiped out many dread diseases (such as polio) that used to kill or cripple thousands of children each year, brought us things such as pain-relief and anti-biotics that we just can&#39;t imagine living without now.  We don&#39;t realize how much things have improved, due to science and medicine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, simple logic should suffice.  If I have complete freedom, does that include the freedom to murder you ?  What stops that ?  Just you having more guns than me ?

    <div class="md"><p>I never claimed that government would be &quot;peaceful&quot;.  Just that it&#39;s better than the alternative.  History teaches us that.</p>

<p>The fact that you have a gun means little if others have plenty of guns too, and can gang up on you with no govt or social order to deter them or stop them.  Rule of law is preferable to chaos, gang warfare or tribal warfare.  Perhaps &quot;failed states&quot; today give an example of what happens when there are plenty of guns and no effective govt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>SO there is an absolute dichotomy between &quot;total freedom&quot; and &quot;chaos, gang warfare or tribal warfare&quot;?</p>

<p>All I said was, existing curtailments of freedom do not justify further curtailments of freedom.  You can trot out strawman fallacies all day long and that still does change the fact that freedom doesn&#39;t work that way.</p>

<p>There have been no failed states with &quot;plenty of guns.&quot;  America is the first state which -- when it fails in the reasonably near future -- will illustrate what happens when a government falls apart under a well-armed populace.  This has never happened before in history.</p>

<p>In every &quot;failed state&quot; thus far there are a few actors that control all the guns, either rebel or ex-government.  The <strong>people</strong> are never armed.  America and Switzerland are the only two countries whose <strong>people</strong> are armed.  That chaos you describe happens when the <strong>people</strong> are disarmed.  The fall of the American federal government will be different because we are not disarmed and therefore we can and will ensure peace.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Total freedom would result in chaos.</p>

<p>If you are saying &quot;the current level of restrictions on freedom are appropriate, but we shouldn&#39;t have more&quot;, I might agree with that.  You&#39;re conceding that the existing fairly large restrictions on freedom are reasonable.</p>

<p>I would say Libya, Somalia, Yemen, Afghanistan could be examples of failed states with lots of guns.</p>

<p>You seem to think there is a difference between &quot;the people&quot; and &quot;rebels&quot; and &quot;governments&quot;.  But the rebels and the govt have large chunks of &quot;the people&quot; supporting them, or they would quickly fail.  Take Syria, for example.  It&#39;s about a 50/50 civil war, both rebels and govt having massive support, which is why it&#39;s gone on so long.  Same in Yemen, I&#39;d say.</p>

<p>Similar in USA: there is no virtuous, unified &quot;the people&quot; who would make everything wonderful if somehow we could get rid of our tyrannical govt.  No, &quot;the people&quot; are the source of the problem.  Many of them are ignorant, selfish, polarized, racist, religious, ideological, etc.  They demand low taxes AND huge military, and cheap gasoline and cheap food and guaranteed jobs etc, so govt borrows money and wires the system to make it happen.  If we somehow brought down the govt, &quot;the people&quot; would fight viciously about what the new system should look like.  Many would take the opportunity to try to write their favorite dogma into the new constitution, by force if necessary.  The country might fragment into enclaves by race, religion, wealth, geography, etc.</p>
