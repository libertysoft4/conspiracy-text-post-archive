        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>God Damn! I am pissed to see all the Racial BS on here. Like fuck! First off, zionism is okay if you aren&#39;t being general and actually have some fucking proof. (Ie. not all jews are zionists).</p>

<p>But recently this whole BlackLiveMatter stuff and the amount of trashy posts on here are just rediculous. They aren&#39;t even conspiracy theories, they are merely reposting new articles involving racial hate(one way or another). </p>

<p>Especially against black people. Like come on guys! We are supposed to be &quot;Thinking Freely&quot; but seriously? we cannot understand basic biology? This is a scary thing for this subreddit.</p>

<p>Zionism again is a belief(a racist one at that)</p>

<p>Posting a bunch of anti-black new posts is stupid and really beneath this subreddit. What research did you have to do to come up with you &quot;theory&quot;.</p>

<p>Now I will admit I agree and think that there are shill both here and in the media, both for and against all races. Especially with the election and the BLM BS movement, not to mention the ALM movement. Fuck both of them! How about a new movement. BioLM: BiologicalLivesMatter. That will just add more grease to the fire, but at least we can have PETA shills on here too!</p>

<p>Honestly, lets clean this sub up and have some decent talks again. Please.</p>

<p>PS: FUCK SHILLS!</p>

<p>But, again....Zionism is a belief system, not a racial identifier. Too be fair, I don&#39;t really believe Jews are technically a race....I mean...its religious identification. Its how Muslims aren&#39;t a race, neither are Christians.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is a good idea. Implementing it will be a bit harder, but if there are some really well renowned members on this sub, they would at least help to put some weight behind it. I know I am not one of them. I am more of a lurker who occasionally posts a link, or comment, so I definitely am not going to impress the mods, but I will definitely help push the bill. I love conspiracy for the good stuff, but all this trash is depressing. I, like most here, do like conspiracy theories, but I need a good one and thankfully this sub has plenty, but digging for them is sometimes a chore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>....the colour of ones skin (ie race by your average person) is based on the amount of a particular chemical known as melanin. There are three main kinds of melanin. Eumelanin(causes Black, Brown, Blond, dark etc..), Pheomelanin(cause the Pinkish look - Penis tip, red hair, lips, tongue, etc..), and Neuromelanin( gives the dark colour in the brain)....You can inject melanin as well as change the amount that is generated in the skin....effectively making someone a different &quot;race&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow.  That&#39;s incredible that you would even argue that.  I can also darken my skin (temporarily) by spending lots of time in the sun.  That doesn&#39;t change my race.<br/>
Race goes far deeper than the skin.  It&#39;s the profound psychological differences that create behavioral differences that matter.  IQ is important (white IQ about 100, black IQ about 85 in the US), but perhaps more important is the propensity to violence, forward thinking, etc.</p>

<p>Again, you are going to have to put down your college textbook or MSM-approved NYT bestseller to get the real story on racial differences.  You can read David Duke&#39;s My Awakening (it&#39;s documented/footnoted throughout so you can check the sources for yourself).</p>

<p>Misperceiving alleged evidence everywhere is not the same as open eyes to facts which do count.</p>

<p>White crime on white crime is also huge problem in our nation.  </p>

<p>Every white on black crime is not motivated by skin color hate just as every black  on white crime is not motivated by skin color hate.  Sometimes, it is a matter of jealousy or greed.  However, the majority of hate crimes do have an anti-black bias.</p>

<p>Also, there is a documented racial disparity with arrests and sentencing.</p>

<p>Black people are not more violent than whites just because they have a different color on the outside.  Skin color does not biologically make a person more violent or criminal than somebody from a different race as seemingly implied.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Race is far more than skin color.  I would never argue that darker skin is the cause of more violent behavior - there&#39;s correlation, but not causality. We have innate psychological and hormonal differences that cause behavioral differences.  For example blacks are more violent on average, have less ability to delay gratification, and have higher testosterone levels.<br/>
White crime on white crime is not a major problem, unless you follow FBI statistics that label &quot;hispanics&quot; as white.  White countries and cities (used to, there are hardly any left) don&#39;t have violent crime epidemics, even in times of war (ie Germans, Poles etc didn&#39;t riot and loot in the destruction of WWII).  </p>

<p>I mean, I respect their opinions if they can provide proof or at least a decently organized theory to build from. They do not provide either, rather they aim to emotionalize and simplify the problem by making blanket statements to cover their accusations, hoping that some people on here will be A: Racist(and promote their hate) or B: Anti-Racist(and perhaps leave with their information to a more respectable subreddit).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you. I think being aware should be paramount. However, merely focusing so blindly on one problem and perpetually rehashing the same belief is not the way to do so, it only leads to tunnel vision(or tunnel thoughts...i guess?). It also means that people here will discount you, similarly to The Boy Who Cried Wolf. You might have some really good posts, but if everyone associates you to bigotry....well...lets say they will most likely be applying a lot of salt.</p>

An agenda.....is your intention....and your intention cannot be &quot;a truth&quot; except in context of whether or not it is <em>your</em> agenda. In legal terms....its a motive. So I will finalize it with this: you agenda is to promote racism mainly directed at the Black community, and within this agenda, is no truth except your own motivation to do so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a bit fishy I will admit,</p>

<p>&quot;Critics of the rule say it would allow HUD to assert authority over local zoning laws. The agency could dictate what types of homes are built where and who can live in those homes, said Gosar, who believes local communities should make those decisions for themselves rather than relying on the federal government.&quot;</p>

<p>but on the whole I do not think the idea is completely focused on destroying the &quot;affluent white communities&quot; as they just said that some more affluent communities were being targeted for affordable housing. There are affluent black people, and affluent asians, and affluent arabs, and affluent (enter group here). So to say that it is targeting whites, that is a little far fetched. Also, it is looking at making poorer neighbourhoods better as well.....this would if anything keep the current occupants more vested in their own communities and thus would be less likely to move to affluent neighbourhoods.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Race is far more than skin color.  I would never argue that darker skin is the cause of more violent behavior - there&#39;s correlation, but not causality. We have innate psychological and hormonal differences that cause behavioral differences.  For example blacks are more violent on average, have less ability to delay gratification, and have higher testosterone levels.<br/>
White crime on white crime is not a major problem, unless you follow FBI statistics that label &quot;hispanics&quot; as white.  White countries and cities (used to, there are hardly any left) don&#39;t have violent crime epidemics, even in times of war (ie Germans, Poles etc didn&#39;t riot and loot in the destruction of WWII).  </p>
