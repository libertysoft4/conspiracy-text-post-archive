<p>I also have no doubt that in a &quot;national security emergency&quot;, the NSA / government can use the phone&#39;s operating system to secretively switch on your microphone and camera and front-facing camera, if they want to record what is going on inside your pocket. </p>

<p>But has anyone found evidence of the switch or the trigger, has anything been revealed of how this gets activated, and which earlier versions of Android operating system might be &quot;safe&quot; from this method of surveillance?</p>

<p>EDIT: <strong>My bad, it happens at the HARDWARE level, not the operating system.</strong></p>

<p>I buy things online from time to time so my laptop that I had at the time knew that I had entered my credit/debit card number onto different websites. I moved to a bigger city for a year and would use my debit card at a grocery store. THE DAY AFTER I first went to that grocery store and used my debit card, I began seeing ads on different websites of that grocery store. I took some time to think about why suddenly how I was seeing these ads on a myriad of websites and came to the conclusion that it was connected by my debit card number. Unless there&#39;s still another explanation, I would love to hear.</p>
