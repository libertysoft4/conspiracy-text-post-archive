        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So listen - I know it is a big pill to swallow, so I&#39;m not going to ask you to swallow it. I&#39;m personally agnostic on the whole Flat Earth thing myself - I prefer to think of myself as someone who questions the idea that we are living on a globe personally... but I digress.</p>

<p>I always try and approach any new topic with the mindset that I don&#39;t know anything (if you think you know ANYTHING then you are not someone I really need to be talking to about any of this). However, with this topic I was immediately against the idea and set out to debunk it... but like a lot of other people, I realized I couldn&#39;t. Don&#39;t get me wrong - there is a TON of bad information out there on this topic, and the overriding theory itself is not 100% formulated - but there are some very interesting points being made and there is definitely a big problem when it comes to proving the earth&#39;s curvature... because it appears that no one can actually do it. </p>

<p>I would like to see this topic to be treated with a little more respect in this subreddit so that we can get to the bottom of it. I&#39;m troubled by the way that anything regarding this topic is immediately ridiculed... I thought that most people here on this subreddit were above that kind of intellectual arrogance. I know it is not a popular subject, but the &quot;flat earth&quot; (or globe-skeptic) conversation is going to keep growing until certain questions are answered - so if you really want it to go away then instead of ridiculing it, perhaps you can try to understand it so that you can either help debunk it or help to uncover some new truths. </p>

<p>These two videos are probably the best ones to get started with the whole flat earth theory:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R77j9rUuky4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R77j9rUuky4</a></p>

<p>I hope that you&#39;ll give this one a chance. It&#39;s actually kind of a fun one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the Coriolis effect is a  great topic. Obviously, the &quot;toilet bowl effect&quot; is proven to be false... but do you want to discuss the spin on hurricanes etc.? Because this article in Scientific American says it doesn&#39;t affect them: <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fact-or-fiction-south-of-equator-tornadoes-spin-in-opposite-direction/">http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fact-or-fiction-south-of-equator-tornadoes-spin-in-opposite-direction/</a></p>

<p>Do you want to talk about snipers using the Coriolis effect? Because I can&#39;t find a legitimate source that shows it to be provably effective for snipers. We can discuss this though. </p>

<p>But if you want to talk about the Coriolis effect and bullets, then you will have to talk to me about the Coriolis effect and planes - because this is a really difficult one for anyone to come up with a definitive answer on too: <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/the-coriolis-effect-and-air-travel.705337/">https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/the-coriolis-effect-and-air-travel.705337/</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m happy to discuss this with you though. I find the Coriolis effect interesting... and the implication of the Coriolis effect brings to mind this Saudi cleric&#39;s argument that I thought was hilarious when I first heard it, but could not figure out why I couldn&#39;t answer it: <a href="https://youtu.be/RqGt0YV1AMQ?t=51">https://youtu.be/RqGt0YV1AMQ?t=51</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re on the right path. Whether it&#39;s flat or not, they are definitely lying to us about it. It&#39;s funny, because as soon as this gets brought up, people lash out like barbarians trying to defend their world view (cognitive dissonance). Even though the FE theory, predates the spherical theory which is about ~500 years old. FE dates back to ancient times, the time when people built the great pyramids which aligned perfectly with astrological alignments, yet they were the heathens and modern man (who eats potato chips and watches fox news) are the intelligent ones. Whether you get downvoted to hell or I do, that means you are shaking the boat. What they are telling us is a lie, and they will fight tooth and nail to defend it. Some are useful idiots, some are just ignorant. Peace and love.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the sun was that close, the sun would be much larger in the middle of the day than at sunset. Since the sun is the same size no matter where or when it is viewed from the surface of the earth, it is plainly obvious that it cannot be 6000 kms above the surface, which is the distance it would have to be to explain the result of Erastothenes experiement.</p>

<p>Because the sun never varies in size, the greeks knew that the sun was extremely far away. So it isn&#39;t a satisfactory explanation. The only other option would be to explain some mechanism for how the sun is able to have the same radial size no matter what distance it is viewed from.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Take a look at this video - it is short and very simply challenges your point: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H2KeQUcmvg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H2KeQUcmvg</a></p>

<p>The video aside, I realize that when the sun is setting, it looks much bigger. There is a reason for this - it is the same reason street lights look massive in the fog <a href="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3735/11791877214_e32116ea32_b.jpg">https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3735/11791877214_e32116ea32_b.jpg</a></p>

<p>This is because the atmosphere is thickest close to the ground, so when we are looking at the sun when it is lower (for round earthers) or further away (for flat earthers) we are looking at it through a lot of air/moisture/pollution and whatnot and it therefore looks bigger. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Measuring the radial size of the sun is really really easy. All you need is an eclipse telescope ( never look directly at the sun). An eclipse telescope can even measure the suns size when it&#39;s overcast, the atmospheres distortion has little to no influence. And there is no reason for why the atmosphere would make the sun look bigger. The atmosphere will distort sunlight sure ( its why the sky gets red in the afternoon), but it wont make it appear larger.</p>

<p>If light from the sun passing through the atmosphere makes the sun appear larger, then so should any else that light reflects off. Like airplanes, buildings and mountains. And this effect would be measurable.</p>

<p>Occams razor disproves your hypothesis unless you can actually show some evidence for this effect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The links you provided don&#39;t even come close to count as evidence. Actual evidence would be scientific mesurments of the suns radial size measured in arcseconds, providing measurable proof of the effect you need to explain your hypothesis. The best way to go about it would be to show how the Sun appears smaller when viewed at a higher altitude, where the atmosphere is thinner and would provide less of a lensing effect. If you could actually prove this it would be a huge scientific breakthrough.</p>

<p>Ironically, the second link you provided <a href="http://www.thenakedscientists.com/forum/index.php?topic=6164.0">http://www.thenakedscientists.com/forum/index.php?topic=6164.0</a>, explains the distortion of the atmosphere while at the same time disproving your hypothesis. The distortion from the atmosphere only amounts to a change of 2% of radial size. Far from the way over 100% change in radial size you would need to explain the sun/moon staying the same size during a day. And the distortion makes objects smaller, not larger.</p>

<p>Asking someone to make a scientific breakthrough is setting the bar high for providing evidence just to have a discussion.

<p>The second link I provided is just a group of people talking about visual distortion of the sun on a physics forum - nothing there is proof or disproof of anything. And if you see my previous comments, you will see how shining lights look larger through a lot of atmosphere.  </p>

<p>If I go north I get to a pole. If I go south I get to a pole. There is no edge to the earth or at least no one has ever seen and reported one. You are invited to take that journey and prove it for us.</p>

Of course, there is not much going on there in terms of life and whatnot, and no one has ever flown under the earth and back up again on the other side (which would prove a globe earth) and there are only a few (sightseeing) flights that actually go over any part of the Antarctic at all.

    <div class="md"><p>Hey dude. I just didn&#39;t like the video you posted - I think it discredits Flat Earth Theory because it is a bit obnoxious, raises bad points and is bad at explaining them. This is nothing against you or against people who are trying to put this theory forward. But it is hard enough to convince people to listen without putting more crap out there. I mean, some of these flat earth people are downright crazy. I&#39;ve been looking at a bunch of youtube videos and there are only a handful of people that come off with any sense of credibility at all, and even some of those are saying stuff which is clearly, easily debunkable... which does not help. </p>

<p>I think the best thing we can do at this point is continue with the experiments that 1. try and find earth&#39;s curvature (of which there appears to be none) and 2. measure the temperature of the moonlight (which appears to be cold). At least these things are quantifiable and could help us progress the discussion in a more rational way. Some of our talking points have severe limitations and can really hurt the quest for truth. </p>

<p>Hope I didn&#39;t offend you - I know you were trying to be supportive. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No disrespect but can you flat earthers please stop bombarding this subreddit over and over with demands that we have an open mind or at least be willing to discuss the possibility of the earth being flat. I&#39;ll be the first to admit, a flat earth fascinates me, just like a Nazi base in the Antarctic etc. </p>

<p>It&#39;s just not a sound theory, I&#39;m a premium member of Art Bells new show and last week he had a debate between an Astrophysicist and a Flat-Earther. The Astrophysicist has multiple PHD&#39;s and studys Stars and Black Holes and i have to say he really did keep an open mind, he didn&#39;t belittle the Flat-Earther at all but at the same time couldn&#39;t Bring the conversation forward because every time the other guy said something about perspective or the horizon/ curvature Of the earth and the like, all he got back was that Nasa is fake etc and he should just read this site or watch this video he would understand. In fact closing down the debate and effectively imposing his beliefs on the Astrophysicist and thats exactly what you all do here.</p>

<p>You see to believe in a flat earth is to say all mathematics Is wrong, it has to be because if the earth is flat then all the mathematical calculations are wrong and well they are not. If the earth is flat then the science/math for this website to work or the keyboard I&#39;m typing on should not work, or the monitor I&#39;m looking at. </p>

<p>All of you people keep posting over and over again demanding we read/debate every single post you all make. Then every single time you say &#39;just read this website&#39; or &#39;watch this youtube video&#39;. In effect you all are demanding that we accept it and you all are trying to impost your beliefs on us. That completely goes agains everything this subreddit stands for.</p>

<p>We all have open minds. People post content to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> Every day but what the don&#39;t do is demand that the entire subreddit conform to there way of thinking and to there belief systems. By doing this all of you are disrectful to this community.</p>

<p>Why do all of you feel that you need validation from us at <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> Because it&#39;s obvious thats what you want. </p>

<p>Please post all of the flat earth content you want. But don&#39;t Harass this community and it&#39;s users anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi there. You spent some time writing this so I will give you a respectful response:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You ask &quot;Flat Earthers&quot; to stop bombarding this subreddit. But do a quick search of this subreddit for Flat Earth topics and you will see there are not very many at all. I&#39;m pretty sure this is my first (only) one, personally. </p></li>
<li><p>You say it is just not a sound theory, and I will agree with you to some extent that the theory is not 100% complete. But the same could be said of the globe earth theory. If you look into the topic some more, you will see that there is a lot more to it than you might initially imagine. </p></li>
<li><p>I&#39;m very sorry you had a bad experience with a flat-earther on Art Bell&#39;s show. I&#39;m sure the guy (I never heard the debate, so I cannot say for certain) was not a good guy, but are you going to base your beliefs on just one guy&#39;s bad attitude? Why not actually look into it yourself and make your own mind up based on evidence and facts?</p></li>
<li><p>To believe in flat earth is not to say that ALL mathematics is wrong. It is to say that some assumptions are wrong, and that doesn&#39;t disprove math, but it skews some results. </p></li>
<li><p>You say we demand that you debate every point we make. Have I even asked you personally to debate me? I would like some debate on this, sure - because I want to get to the truth and I don&#39;t think I&#39;m there yet. Isn&#39;t that what this subreddit is about? Free thinking and discussion? I thought that people here enjoyed thinking about unusual subjects and wanted to seek out the truth. You seem to think that I&#39;m being disrespectful - but can you isolate one sentence that I have written on this topic which is disrespectful. People throw out links and supporting evidence all the time (and are often criticized if they don&#39;t), so why is it when it is on this topic, it is us &quot;demanding&quot; that you accept our beliefs?</p></li>
<li><p>At what point did making a post asking for some discussion constitute harassment? </p></li>
<li><p>Good luck with your sticky - can you try and get my response stickied to your sticky in the interests of fairness?</p></li>

<p>I would like to see this topic to be treated with a little more respect in this subreddit</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think that is unlikely from what I have seen so far.  Questioning the shape of the earth seems to be a step too far for some people.  It is possible to discuss something without agreeing with it.  There is also the narrative that the whole thing is a psy-op that exists to discredit other theories which scares some people and prevents them from looking.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it. - Aristotle</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When looking at this topic it is important to see past the false dichotomy of official spinning globe model vs. standard flat earth model.  Proofs against one are not direct proofs of the other.  Much of the evidence presented on the topic is evidence against the official globe model.  Proving any other model 100% correct is much more difficult.</p>

<p>My own position right now is that the neither of those two models is correct,  To accept the standard flat earth model I would need to get an answer to this question: How do long summer days work in the Southern &#39;hemisphere&#39;?  This should occur when the sun&#39;s path is at it&#39;s largest radius around the North pole.  In order to get a 17 hour day at a far Southern location the sun would need to be visible for ~70% of its circuit.  That would require the sun&#39;s visible radius to be huge, too large for day lengths to work properly at other locations.  I have not been able to find a satisfactory answer to this question.</p>

<p>But that does not mean that the official spinning globe model is correct.  All it takes is one solid counterpoint to the official model for this to be a legitimate topic, and there are many of them.  </p>

<p>Some of the personalities involved in this topic are quite suspicious.  I bought Eric Dubay&#39;s book &quot;The Flat Earth Conspiracy&quot; and participated in his forum (ifers.boards.net), but was banned a couple of months ago for questioning the labeling of another user as a shill.  Eric Dubay accused many other people who were talking about the subject of being &quot;shills&quot;.  Here is his blog post on the topic: <a href="http://www.atlanteanconspiracy.com/2015/06/flat-earth-shill-wall-of-shame.html">http://www.atlanteanconspiracy.com/2015/06/flat-earth-shill-wall-of-shame.html</a>  I find Matt Boylan to be similarly suspicious.  However, there is controlled opposition in any conspiracy that matters.</p>

<p>Watching flat earth debunk videos on youtube is interesting.  Most use a huge number of strawman arguments and resort to calling the subject silly and anyone who questions the shape of the earth stupid.  As you&#39;ve noted yourself, certain users in this subreddit are quick to ridicule any post on this topic.</p>

<p>I think Bill Cooper had it right: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Listen to everyone, read everything, believe nothing unless you can prove it in your own research. William Cooper </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don&#39;t look for someone you can trust, listen to ideas and evaluate them yourself.  If you are just looking for someone trustworthy you give up your own opportunity to reason and are susceptible to confidence scams.</p>

Underlit clouds at sunset, and the visibility and movements of the stars - these are the main things that get in the way of Flat Earth Theory for me. But the round earth theory has holes too - like the fact that there appears to be no curvature of large bodies of water, and that you can always see the flat horizon at eye level - even from a plane. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As the link says, the effect is very weak. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why you need a completely still pool to observe it. </p>

<p>So snopes is right in that the typical toilet and sink won&#39;t show the Coriolis effect, but my claim is that the effect is observable if you control for the initial flow of water, as shown in my previous link  in the pool experiment - such controlled conditions don&#39;t exist in toilets or sinks. </p>

<p>So the Coriolis effect does exist, but it&#39;s so weak you&#39;ll never notice it unless you try to. </p>

<p>I guess the scientific mainstream is at odds with itself over the Coriolis effect then - which is something neither of us probably would have known unless we started looking into Flat Earth Theory - which is a good case for looking into this topic. I&#39;ve learned a bunch through studying it. </p>

<p>However, if you would like to insist that the Coriolis effect is real, then I&#39;d like to discuss with you how it affects planes and bullets. Let me know!</p>

<li>This wobble takes too long for us to factor it in... the North Star is not perfectly aligned, and over thousands of years the constellations do move somewhat. And he talks about the earth wobbling 180 degrees? What? </li>
<li>Different amounts of centripetal force between the north pole and equator is something mainstream science talks about. It is nothing new. Google it. </li>
<li>Cannonballs - show me the experiment. I cannot find it. </li>
<li>Perspective - that&#39;s fine but it doesn&#39;t prove anything. </li>
<li>Planes and spinning earth - I agree this is something that needs to be discussed, but this guy is just not doing a good job of convincing me. Mainstream science says that friction keeps the atmosphere locked to the rotation of the earth so therefore the plane would be moving relative to the earth - in a similar way to how we can walk normally through a moving train. And his rocket/train analogy doesn&#39;t make sense to be honest, because the rocket should be going 75 mph faster than the train (until the drag of the atmosphere slows it down). </li>
</ol>

<p>And I don&#39;t like the way this guy says that there is something wrong with me if I argue with him. </p>

<p>That&#39;s what I mean about there being a ton of disinfo on this topic. A lot of people are throwing easily debunkable stuff out there and discrediting the whole topic. </p>
