<p>His credibility has since been destroyed, and he has been completely dismissed by the mainstream media as a &quot;nutter&quot;. How convenient for the security services who wanted to shut him up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, you were being serious? You threw me off with the dog question. I figured it was a reference to the Son of Sam or something bizarre. What if a person believes that there is no real gender? That gender is just a perception of behavioral and environmental stimuli.</p>

<p>Now, I&#39;m not saying I personally believe that I&#39;m some kind of androgynous fish. I&#39;m quite the typical hetero male. Maybe more so due to my ethnic background. But if I were to put all that aside I still believe that the spiritual side of the human, or the thought portion has no real gender.</p>

<p>That makes as much sense as schizophrenic who believes the figments of their imagination are real, when in reality they are not. There are biological genders, male and female.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But if I were to put all that aside I still believe that the spiritual side of the human, or the thought portion has no real gender.</p>

<p>Duality, yes we are both male and female, but that is not the discussion here. See what I said about a schizophrenic who has a female alter personality. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m well aware of different psychological maladies and their different <strong>manifestations</strong>.</p>

<p>Bold word is the important part. The psyche can manifest a whole human that I could only see, it could also manifest my desire to be another gender. Mental disorder. You&#39;re proving my point here.</p>

<p>You asked me what gender was the psyche and I responded.</p>

<p>How? Me and my dog are in a room <strong>alone</strong>. How many people should I see? A sane person wouldn&#39;t see anyone. To a schizophrenic, it could be 1,2,3,4 others.</p>

<p>If the mind can manifest a human, what makes you think it cannot manifest you are another gender (schizophrenic alter personality). A schizophrenic can also become, that female alter personality. This is my point. As I said to Houston, transgender is a delusion and a disorder.</p>
