    <div class="md"><p>I used to ask that. Here&#39;s the answer: God is not a separate entity. God is not some externalized all-powerful dude in the sky or in another dimension. </p>

<p>Rather, God is Nature. God is everything. God is &quot;creation&quot;. Not superman.</p>

<p>So it&#39;s kind of a nonsense question based on a false assumption.</p>

<p>(Don&#39;t feel bad -- part of the point of religion is to make us externalize God. It turns out the State has no authority over God, hence no authority over us. If we would only realize it.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seems to me like you&#39;re just redefining terms. If god is just the same thing as nature, why call it god? I mean using your logic, I could just as easily say god exists because god is a sandwich I&#39;m currently eating. Redefining god does nothing to answer the original question of whether or not there is an all power entity that created the universe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>(Assuming I understand this all correctly...)</p>

<p>It&#39;s the other way around: Religion re-defined the ancient concept of God to make the concept no longer a threat to the State. (&quot;Nature&quot; is just more acceptable for atheists.)</p>

<p>The threatening idea is that the State didn&#39;t make you; God did. If God made you -- if God <strong>author</strong>ed you --- the State has no <strong>author</strong>ity over you. Only God has <strong>author</strong>ity over you.</p>

<p>All it demonstrates is that the State did not create you. A higher &quot;author&quot; did.</p>

<p>But there&#39;s no way I can condense all those videos into one tl;dr. </p>

<p>The sate doesn&#39;t claim to have made me, so I&#39;m not sure how the idea that it didn&#39;t is threatening.</p>

<p>My problem with calling nature god, is that it&#39;s ultimately a meaningless statement. Calling nature god doesn&#39;t change anything about nature. Nature isn&#39;t an intelligent, all powerful entity and doesn&#39;t have any of the characteristics normally associated with god. </p>

<p>Going back to the sandwich metaphor, calling a sandwich god doesn&#39;t make the sandwich an all powerful, intelligent entity that is responsible for my creation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If God made you -- if God authored you</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But, if nature is god, then there is no author. Sure I guess you can say nature created people, but it would be far more accurate to say that people emerged because of natural laws. There was no intelligence behind the creation of humanity, and thus no god. Simply calling nature god, doesn&#39;t make it so.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Only God has authority over you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This makes sense with the traditional definition of god, as an all powerful entity must have authority over me in order to be all powerful. </p>

<p>However it makes no sense when god is simple nature. Sure everything in the universe is subject to natural and physical laws, and in that way nature has authority over us, but at the same time nature has no moral authority over us. We are not forced to follow a moral code imposed on us by nature and we have complete authority over ourselves within the confines of the physical laws. </p>

<p>Nature is not all powerful either, as nature itself is subject to natural laws. It is impossible for any part of nature to step outside these laws. I fail to understand how nature in any can be equated with god. Unless of course you redefine god. In which case, you could call anything god.</p>

<p>The state doesn&#39;t claim to have authority over you. It claims to have authority over the fictional corporation that&#39;s printed on your birth certificate. The trick is: you say that corporation is you, thereby giving the state authority over you.</p>

<p>Yes indeed nature is subject to Natural Law. That&#39;s the only law you and I are truly subject to.</p>

<p>Forget about God as an all-powerful entity. That concept of God has been injected into your head by religion -- a creation of the state.</p>

<p>If you want to understand, watch the videos. They&#39;re well-worth it, and I&#39;d love to know that more people understand this. I&#39;ve been at this full-time (8+ hours a day) for over a year, and this has radically shifted my view of history, religion, and politics.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s what god is. Again you can call anything god (such as a sandwich), but that is completely meaningless.  Also the idea of gods being intelligent, and powerful entities goes back further than the concept of the state, so it doesn&#39;t make sense to say the state created that definition of god. </p>

<p>But your worldview isn&#39;t based on facts at all.

    <div class="md"><p>no, If God can do anything, than anything god did would just be a single point on a scale with no upper or lower limit.  And after god did that thing then he would still be capable of doing anything, which would include outdoing the other thing he just did, into infinity.</p>

<p>The only logical way that God could create a rock so large that he couldn&#39;t lift it would be if God stripped himself of his status as God after he created the rock.  </p>

<p>So the real question, and the only question when dealing with the limitations of god should he exist, is the question of &quot;Can God choose to no longer be God?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>God is perfect. Man isn&#39;t (Free will and temptations).</p>

<p>Man has a few steps to go:</p>

<ul>
<li> Man can not rise until man recognizes his own imperfections, and perfect them.</li>
<li> He must link his thoughts to Creation instead of his own selfish existence.</li>
<li> He must become an adult, and take responsibility for his own sovereignty.</li>
</ul>

<p>There has been many traps for man to fall into, but the Creator are there to help you help yourself back on your feet. If you want, that is.</p>

<p>Then we can talk change on a grand scale.</p>

<p>The &quot;Illuminati&quot; knows this. Governments only reflect what the citizens &quot;want&quot;. It is a democracy after all... By not uniting, which it is all about, you are inadvertently accepting what they are doing. Simply by not denying them.</p>

<p>Fix yourself, and become the adults of the human race, and viola; the world is yours. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If what you say is true we technically can do whatever we want. Let&#39;s avoid telling the masses that anymore then we already do; they have no self control. Humans are quite powerful, potentially. The spectrum is quite astonishing (from non-essential, &quot;proles&quot; to intelligences that defy comprehension). I think there is some kind of &quot;group mind&quot; consciousness that influences all of us. It may not be &quot;God&quot; but it&#39;s damn close and its powerful. You might call it Lucifer. &quot;They&quot; would call it Lucifer. It plays games with us, games that are fun to it and may or may not be fun to us. &quot;God&quot; I think, is like you say, everything. We&#39;re supposed to treat everything with respect; animals, plants, rocks.. Not to mention the Earth, your ancestors, the &quot;gods&quot;, &quot;God&quot;, the stars, nature in general, etc. it&#39;s all part of you and your part of it. I have to disagree with your post because I honestly think this IS the time when we SHOULD try to bring truth into the light. THIS IS OUR CHANCE! And death definitely does exist, Haha. You shouldn&#39;t fear it but it is definitely unavoidable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The anthropomorphic god or gods exists and does not exist at the same time. God is the energy that animates life. All life. No matter how much science learns it will never know &quot;god&quot; it can never know the origin of energy. </p>

<p>Even minerals hold onto energy (there&#39;s motion in dem atoms). Science cannot explain how this motion began and no religion can teach us why this motion exists.</p>

<p>In antiquity they didn&#39;t practice religion as we currently define it. They, just like us, couldn&#39;t explain the unexplainable but in pursuit of the definition found knowledge. What they left were visual and verbal interpretations of what they learned but couldn&#39;t quite explain.</p>

<p>I for one am no atheist nor theist. I am not afraid to lose my physical life and am in no rush to get to my spiritual life.</p>
