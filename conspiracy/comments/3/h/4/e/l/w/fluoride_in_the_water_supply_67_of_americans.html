    <div class="md"><p>This is true, the gov&#39;t openly admit to having fluoride in the water supply and claim it makes our teeth &quot;healthy&quot;.</p>

<p>Many people don&#39;t understand the power of the Pineal Gland, which is why no one talks about this. A lot of people say it&#39;s only pseudoscience and will say that it is insignificant. My suggestion would be to find water that doesn&#39;t have fluoride and stick with it, as well as opening your Pineal Gland. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no credible evidence that fluoridated water has ever prevented a single dental cavity. Here&#39;s some quotes from the 2015 Cochrane review of artificial water fluoridation. 
p 2 &quot;A total of 155 studies met the inclusion criteria; 107 studies provided sufficient data for quantitative synthesis.&quot;
p 2 &quot;There is insufficient information to determine whether initiation of a water fluoridation programme results in a change in disparities in caries across socioeconomic status (SES) levels.
There is insufficient information to determine the effect of stopping water fluoridation programmes on caries levels.
No studies that aimed to determine the effectiveness of water fluoridation for preventing caries in adults met the review&#39;s inclusion criteria.&quot;
p 3 &quot;Researchers from the Cochrane Oral Health Group reviewed the evidence - up to 19 February 2015 - for the effect of water fluoridation. They identified 155 studies in which children receiving fluoridated water (either natural or artificial) were compared with those receiving water with very low or no fluoride. Twenty studies examined tooth decay, most of which (71%) were conducted prior to 1975. A further 135 studies examined dental fluorosis.&quot;
p 14 &quot;Five studies were funded by research grants from research organisations, health authorities and government organisations, one study was funded in collaboration with members of the committee pro-fluoridation, while the other studies [on caries] did not state their funding sources.&quot;
p 17 &quot;We judged that all the 20 studies included for the caries outcome (including disparities in caries) were at high risk of bias overall.&quot;
p 17 &quot;We found all studies to be at high risk of bias for confounding. We considered confounding factors for this outcome to be sugar consumption/dietary habits, SES, ethnicity and the use of other fluoride sources.&quot;
p 28 &quot;Whilst these [fluoridated] areas tend to have low to very low DMFT, there are many other parts of the world where fluoridated water is not widespread that also have low caries levels. Equally, there are areas with relatively high distribution of water fluoridation and moderate caries levels (e.g. Brazil).&quot;
p 30 &quot;The quality of the evidence, when GRADE criteria are applied, is judged to be low.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fluoride is not an element required for the body to function. It is not a required component of any process or tissue. It does accumulate in the bones and cause deformation of the teeth and bones. Type skeletal fluorosis and dental fluorosis into Google images and see for yourself. In smaller amounts it can cause arthritis and other problems. Why would one think that something that causes problems in small and large doses, that bioaccumulates, that is completely unnecessary for biology, is something beneficial for one&#39;s health?</p>

<p>The studies that support water fluoridation are dubious and very old. Yet, there are many studies new and old that suggest harmful effects. The history of fluoride in industry has even demonstrated those effects. Before they scrubbed the waste with water, they vented it and the local area was affected by it. Cattle and people were exposed and visible bone deformations resulted.</p>

<p>Authority empowered with some of the best propagandists in history has brought us to this place. It&#39;s amazing the contortions of cognition we will do in order to align our perceptions with the claims of authority. We don&#39;t want to believe our protectors would hurt us for self serving advantages, but they do regularly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Skeletal fluorosis is something that only happens with excessive exposure to fluoride (mainly people that work in the mining industry) or people drinking from water wells in India/China which have insane levels of fluoride.</p>

<p>Burning coal indoor is also a cause. You&#39;re not getting Skeletal fluorosis from drinking water in the US, ever.</p>

<p>I can find no credible information on fluoride causing arthritis, if you can provide citation on that I&#39;d like to see it.</p>

<p>Can you also please provide these new studies that say fluoride is harmful, and before you do so please be aware if you link a single Chinese IQ fluoride study I&#39;m going to pick it apart so don&#39;t waste your time.</p>

<p>Fluoride is also naturally occurring in most water supplies which means humans have evolved ingesting fluoride, it&#39;s found in most water supplies in fairly high levels.</p>

<p>Heres a section of my answer which should appear somewhere else in this thread.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The evidence is slowly coming out that researchers and dentists falsely read into the esteemed benefits of fluoride, especially that of digestion, where their thesis is that swallowed fluoride enters the bloodstream from the stomach (like most things we drink and eat) and is found mixed with the saliva produced by your salivary glands. The saliva acts as a continual dosage to the teeth in your mouth. Reasonable. But what else is getting a continual dosage?</p>

<p>If you read my entire answer though, it&#39;ll be clear I am certainly not in support of forcefully medicating our tap water with fluoridation (which as you outline, surfaces in many unexpected places with an abnormally high dose)</p>

<p>If it needed clarification, it&#39;s easy to verify the researcher&#39;s claim that saliva will have an increased concentration of fluoride due to us being forcefully medicated with it, <strong>which is topically and constantly applied to our teeth.</strong>  But I really would appreciate you commenting on my full answer in this thread btw.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many necessary long term studies about the effects of chemicals on the human body are difficult to achieve for many reasons. One danger is that greedy corporations must sell their product now, or must implement their poorly designed, poorly and short-term tested drugs, products, snake oil. After all, we only live 80 years. If the human race really cared about each and everyone&#39;s genetic future (which is sadly not the case) then we&#39;d perform long term (lifetime+) studies before dosing over 70% of an entire country, in the case of fluoride. The evidence is slowly coming out that researchers and dentists falsely read into the esteemed benefits of fluoride, especially that of digestion, where their thesis is that swallowed fluoride enters the bloodstream from the stomach (like most things we drink and eat) and is found mixed with the saliva produced by your salivary glands. The saliva acts as a continual dosage to the teeth in your mouth. Reasonable. But what else is getting a continual dosage?</p>

<p>Is one wrong to say that digestion of fluoride is unnecessary and potentially dangerous to control a population&#39;s dosage? At the minimum, long term studies must be taken seriously. In the meantime, I&#39;ll confess that optional topical application through toothpaste both coats the the tooth with fluoride and partially absorbs through the gums (I pray no child swallows the toothpaste,) which has shown to have minor (believe it or not, some researchers even suggest no effect) benefits to enamel health and tooth cavity reduction. My main concern is certainly with unmonitored, negligent amounts of fluoride accumulating within our bones, organs, brains (and brain glands, which is where some will mention the pineal gland) and cells. Some of it is just not excreted when digested/drank. I&#39;ll prove it with some papers which requires a slight connecting of a few dots to get across the point that long term fluoride absorption is something to truly think and worry about.</p>

<p>A) The absorption and excretion of fluoride and arsenic in humans (Zhenga et al., 2002) <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378427402000826">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378427402000826</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: The dietary intake of fluoride and the fluoride excretions in urine and stool were determined under controlled conditions in man. Fluoride balance studies have shown that the urinary fluoride corresponds to 50–60% of the intake, the fecal fluoride was very low, corresponding to 6% of the intake, and approximately 1 mg fluoride was retained per day during an average fluoride intake of 4.3 mg/day. The fluoride intake depended on the amount of fluoridated water consumed. The dietary fluoride content ranged from 1.2 to 1.5 mg/day. During the intake of supplemental fluoride the fluroide excretions increased but the ratio of the urinary/fecal fluoride was similar. Added fluoride is well retained. Following its discontinuation, very small amounts of the retained fluoride are excreted for several days. Inorganic elements, such as calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium, which have been shown to decrease the intestinal absorption of fluoride in animals were ineffective in man, while aluminum, given as aluminum-containing antacids, markedly decreased the intestinal absorption of fluoride and thereby decreased the retention of fluoride.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>B) Effect of Discontinuation of Fluoride Intake from Water and Toothpaste on Urinary Excretion in Young Children (Martins et al., 2011) <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3138016/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3138016/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The results may have been different if the experiment had been conducted with adults, as fluoride retention (percentage of absorbed fluoride), extrarenal clearance, skeletal uptake [20] and fluoride removal from the plasma is generally greater in children than adults [21,22].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>C) The fractional urinary fluoride excretion in young children under stable fluoride intake conditions.(Villa et al., 2000) <a href="http://www.researchgate.net/publication/12308242_The_fractional_urinary_fluoride_excretion_in_young_children_under_stable_fluoride_intake_conditions">http://www.researchgate.net/publication/12308242_The_fractional_urinary_fluoride_excretion_in_young_children_under_stable_fluoride_intake_conditions</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fluoride retention was also estimated assuming a constant average F fraction of 10% excreted through faeces. It was found that the average proportion of liquids, solid foods, and toothpaste to the daily fluoride intake (1.02-mg F/day on average) were 40.8, 34.6, and 24.5%, respectively. The average FUEF value was 35.5% (95% C.I.=31.7-39.3%), and the estimated fractional F retention was 54.5%.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So these are just some papers I&#39;ve collected over the last couple of months. Note that America&#39;s federal, state, and local government (and dentists!) sponsored and began fluoridating most it&#39;s water more than 60 years ago. Why are these studies just beginning to accumulate (year 2000+,) all of which are pointing toward a hard truth? That maybe we shouldn&#39;t be forcefully (and usually unknowingly to the many) medicating most of the country? So now I ask the reader to look him or herself for the established effect that fluoride has in super-optimal doses. To get you started, it&#39;s a fact that in some Asian countries, where fluoridation is over 4ppm, real, ugly effects occur in children and adults (mostly the latter) when monitored. Its claimed the optimal amount of fluoride in water is anywhere from 0.7ppm - 1ppm.</p>

<p>The most important thing to remember is poison is all about dose. The only valid defense pro-flouridation has is that there is not enough fluoride to cause any harm. Fine. I believe that too. But connect the dots, people. Look at the research. What happens in the summer when you are drinking twice as much fluoridated water as the winter? Has your loving water supplier worked this into the algorithm ( i pray) that decides how much of the vat of fluoride to add to a certain amount of water? I just looked at the most recent extensive blood of both my parents and they definitely do not test for fluoride. Why not? Regardless, this wouldn&#39;t be a complete study if one didnt examine the tissue and glands. See, some research does in fact do this and shows deposits in the pineal gland. (See the post in this thread by u/munkomanko)</p>

<p>And as a bonus here&#39;s some more info about fluoride deposition</p>

<blockquote>
<p>First, about half of the fluoride you consume is excreted through your kidneys into your urine, while the other half becomes bound in your skeleton. The fluoride that enters your bones is eliminated very slowly. The NRC estimates the biological half-life of fluoride in bone (the time for half of it to be removed) is as long as 20 years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not so sure. If I can locate the study, I&#39;ll link it, but basically, reverse osmosis removes about 70 percent of the fluoride, distilled removes about 50, and regular carbon filters vary, but remove very little on average. Zero Water removes ions, and fluoride is an ion, so I would assume they work as well, although the company still needs to pay for a test to be done to certify their filter for fluoride removal. If you use rain water in the zero water filter, there should be guaranteed no fluoride whatsoever. </p>

<p>Check the boiling point of fluoride, both calcium fluoride and hexafluorosilicic acid. That should tell you why fluoride follows the distilled water into the container. (Not a chemist, so somebody correct me if I fucked something up here)</p>

<p>We don’t actually state that much in our packaging. These things are all subjective. But in terms of removing TDS, yes, it’s just as effective as RO. But generally, ion exchange against a large body of contaminants will do just as well as RO. There’s so many things that could be in your water.

<p><a href="http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2010/12/18/distilled-water-interview.aspx">Distillation also will not effectively remove fluoride, another dangerous element added to most water supplies. Distillation can remove an estimated 55-60 percent of fluoride, but the rest will get transferred. A reverse osmosis system is slightly more effective, capable of removing about 80 percent of fluoride</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mercola spouts nonsense about mineral deficiencies caused by distillation, and is absolute distinfo not to be trusted.  You ALWAYS receive the lions share of your vitamins and minerals from your food.  Not your water.</p>

<p>The size and weight of fluoride makes it extremely difficult to remove.  Filters are effectively useless for this purpose.  You thinking that your 00 reading on a $10 marketing device included with your zero filter is marketing alone.  Do you honestly believe that ultra pure water used industrially is made by running it through a consumer grade zero filter then checking it with an inaccurate marketing device?  There is only one way to create pure h2o - steam distillation.  Running it through once probably isn&#39;t going to do it, but it&#39;s still magnitudes purer than filtered water.</p>

<p>Your water filtration may remove some of the fluoride.  Its one step closer, but it&#39;s by no means pure h2o.  I&#39;m glad you feel you&#39;re seeing results.  You&#39;re not however reaching the purity of distillation.  It&#39;s not even in the same ballpark, regardless of what your marketing device tells you.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a fun article about the company (it&#39;s actually a sponsored commercial advertisement), though it clearly tells you the company&#39;s focus.  It isn&#39;t pure water, I&#39;m afraid.  <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/zero-contaminants-in-drinking-water/">http://www.zdnet.com/article/zero-contaminants-in-drinking-water/</a></p>

<p>Ok, Mercola is a businessman, sure. However, to prove (or at least make it more likely) that the study I am still currently looking for actually exists  (I know it does), I cited that specific line in his article. Mercola cites scientific studies in most of this articles and has his own personal bent on a lot of topics, so I am not citing any other line or any other piece of information from that article other than the line I gave you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My experience is merely anecdotal.  (Although there is plenty to read about it on many different websites.)  About 9 months ago, I had the same realization that OP had and I just began being more mindful of it and I began to meditate.  Since that time I feel more clear and intuitive and my friends and family have even mentioned it to me. </p>

<p>I am still a beginner and my mindfulness techniques certainly didn&#39;t turn me into a neurologist; however, it did make me happier and more clear.</p>

<p>The way I imagine it though is this:</p>

<p>Your pineal gland has cones and rods just like the retina does.  I imagine if you kept one eye shut for an extended period it would begin to atrophy just like anything else.  If after an extended period of time you could open it and begin to use it again and it would rehabilitate (just like anything else.)</p>

<p>We as a culture currently don&#39;t know how to use our pineal glands at all, and most believe the intentional <em>use</em> of it to be pseudoscience.  I believe that during meditation it is possible to activate your pineal gland and therefore use it and rehabilitate it, which <em>may</em> have the effect of &quot;de-calcifying&quot; it.  </p>

<p>Again, merely anecdotal. But to answer your question:  Yes I have put some thought into it.</p>

<p>Why does this sensation have to do anything with the pineal gland?  With decalcification of the pineal gland?  Why not a dozen other mechanisms that have more neurological proof?  </p>

<p>Or maybe it&#39;s simply that you are more relaxed, focused, less anxious, less depressed since mindfulness tends to dissolve negativity.  </p>

I&#39;d be open to reading whatever you read, but if we leave this at anecdotes, the average intelligent individual will (and should) have a short chance of changing his/her mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I bought a water distiller a few months ago. Cost me about 120 bucks on ebay.  I bought it after seeing so many studies on fluoride and how it just makes you a better sheep.  I know its unprovable but in just a short 3 months my ability to concentrate is much more focused and ability of saying fuck it seems to be improving as well.  Maybe its just the placebo effect but each time I distill a gallon of water I cannot believe the amount of shit left behind from the boiling process. It smells like burnt plastic and hydrochloric acid  fumes. Each gallon of water I make leaves behind about half a teaspoon of this foul crap.  I&#39;m sure most of it is calcium but there&#39;s definitely some industrial waste in there as well. </p>

<p>If anyone is interested in getting clean water and live in a apt or otherwise cant install a reverse osmosis water filter check it out.  I like mine makes about 1 gallon every 4 hrs and you will see your electric bill increase since its about 550 watts to run.  But its cheaper than buying from the grocery store and easier than lugging around gallons of water each week. </p>

<p>Fluoride is in virtually every foodstuff that uses municipal fluoridated water in its processing. It doesn&#39;t evaporate out during the cooking process - rather, it CONCENTRATES, so canned soups, vegetables, salsas, condiments and even products like breads will contain fluoride.</p>

<p>This toxic waste is ubiquitous in our diets. It is everywhere, from the fruit juices we drink to the water we use to flush our heavily fluoridated poop down the fucking toilet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This was proven in a study called, &quot;Comparative Toxicity of Fluorine Compounds.&quot; After this study was completed, this statement was made: &quot; ... this meant a daily intake of approximately 40 mg/kg of fluorine from sodium fluoride as compared with 3400 mg/kg from calcium fluoride. Therefore, from the standpoint of lethal concentrations and amount of fluorine necessary to cause growth inhibition, wide differences in toxicity of some of the compounds of fluoride were noted.&quot; (See 3-1: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry. July 1934, page 797). In other words, industrial waste (sodium fluoride) is 85 times more toxic than natural calcium fluoride. Both of them contain fluoride, but they are totally different compounds. (Also see 3-2).</p>

<p>This is incorrect. The stated statistic of &#39;it takes x litres of water to make y litres of beer&#39; takes into account ALL of the water used in the brewing process. That includes the brewing water, as well as water used for cleaning/sanitizing, rinsing bottles/kegs and cooling the wort after boiling and prior to fermentation, and any losses that occur due to retention in pipes, hoses, spillage etc. During the boil, about 10% of the volume is lost due to evaporation, but this hardly equates to what you stated.</p>

<p>And for what it&#39;s worth, many breweries use reverse osmosis water to maintain consistency of the mineral content of the water - ie the brewing salts are added to the water to give the mineral profile the brewer is after (and no, fluoride is not one of them...)</p>

<p>If you are interested in detoxing your body of everything, start going to the sauna or a local spa. Sweat that shit out as much as possible and exercise to keep the blood flowing through your brain.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll make this really short and really easy to understand.</p>

<p>The Chinese water study does not mean what you think it does, they looked at areas with well over 10 times the amount of fluoride found in normal drinking water and didn&#39;t account for anything else that might also be in that water.</p>

<p>This has it all, I am beyond sick of seeing people link this because anyone that even bothers to read it can clearly see it&#39;s 100% taken out of context/doesn&#39;t say what you&#39;re trying to say it says.</p>

<p>On top of this, you did not just link a fucking PHD paper as some type of study on fluoride right? please tell me you didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>You also linked the follow up study and called it a &quot;government report&quot; because it&#39;s on fucking pubmed, which means you don&#39;t actually know what pubmed is.</p>

<p>And honestly I was about to type up a big response to this one, but I&#39;ve done it so many times now I&#39;m just done. It&#39;s beyond obvious you didn&#39;t read this one either.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve claimed fluoride reduces IQ and linked a study that doesn&#39;t actually say that, I&#39;ve corrected that and some how what I did was disinformation.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve claimed people are getting dumber, yet IQ has been increasing since the 1900s and is still increasing today. Why is that? all just lies right? our IQs are really going down?</p>

<p>Let me explain to you how the real world works. You can&#39;t claim what someone says is disinformation without refuting it.</p>

<p>A standard score of IQ 100 is defined as the median performance of the standardization sample.</p>

<p>Meaning, as the very definition of intelligence is tweaked to fit the average of the masses, they reevaluate and change the basis for calculating such intelligence.  And:</p>

</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;ve attempted to claim that the doses of fluoride were extremely high, therefore the cognitive declines shown in the studies are not valid because &quot;we aren&#39;t exposed similarly.&quot; You&#39;re also solely basing fluoride exposure on tap water fluoridation amounts, and not calculating total exposure to fluoride from all sources.</p>

<p>Your argument: <strong>IQ scores are going up, so fluoride has zero effect on intelligence, idiots.</strong></p>

<p>Look around you.  You think your neighbors, colleagues, and even family are more intelligent today than people were 50 years ago?  Yeah, seems like I&#39;ve been totally stomped here.

    <div class="md"><p>Did you even read what you just fucking said rofl? this is easily the worst mental gymnastics attempts I have ever seen in my life.</p>

<p>You claimed fluoride was REDUCING THE IQ SCORES OF PEOPLE.</p>

<p>The average IQ score has been increasing every year since 1900, IQ is not actually related to intelligence which is why he said that.</p>

<p>Test scores are not related to IQ.</p>

<p>On top of this, you&#39;re once again showing you didn&#39;t read the study.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care if you&#39;re rolling around in a fluoride bath every day for 20 years, you&#39;re not coming ANYWHERE NEAR the level of fluoride in those Chinese studies.</p>

<p>The people that wrote the study you&#39;re trying to cite have already come out and say the anti-fluoride quacks are not understanding what it says.</p>

<p>They did not account for ANYTHING ELSE. That includes Arsenic/lead.</p>

<p>&quot;The Harvard researchers wrote in their article that the average standardized mean difference (0.45) in IQ scores “may be within the measurement error of IQ testing.” Despite web pages claiming that the article ”confirms” that fluoride reduces IQ scores, the Harvard co-authors did not reach a firm conclusion, writing instead that “our results support the possibility of adverse effects …” Indeed, their article called for more and better-quality research, including more “precise” data on the children involved and assurances that other factors have been ruled out as reasons for the IQ differences&quot;</p>

<p>The two Harvard researchers who reviewed these studies have distanced themselves from the way in which anti-fluoride activists have misrepresented their article. After contacting these researchers, the Wichita Eagle newspaper reported, “While the studies the Harvard team reviewed did indicate that very high levels of fluoride could be linked to lower IQs among schoolchildren, the data is not particularly applicable here because it came from foreign sources where fluoride levels are multiple times higher than they are in American tap water.”</p>

<p>You lose man, you have literally no idea what you&#39;re talking about and it&#39;s making me cringe just thinking about this.</p>

<p>Please educate yourself to the point you&#39;re at least capable of reading and understanding a study before you embarrass yourself anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aren&#39;t you an absolute saint.  Trying to set the world straight by advocating further poisoning.  <strong>You&#39;re latching on to one micro aspect of the HARVARD study.  No one cares about IQ.  We&#39;re not talking about IQ, yet you can&#39;t seem to give it up.</strong>  From the study in question:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A recent report from the U.S. National Research Council (NRC 2006) concluded that adverse effects of high fluoride concentrations in drinking water may be of concern and that additional research is warranted. Fluoride may cause neurotoxicity in laboratory animals, including effects on learning and memory ...
To summarize the available literature, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies on increased fluoride exposure in drinking water and neurodevelopmental delays. We specifically targeted studies carried out in rural China that have not been widely disseminated, thus complementing the studies that have been included in previous reviews and risk assessment reports ... 
Findings from our meta-analyses of 27 studies published over 22 years suggest an inverse association between high fluoride exposure and children&#39;s intelligence ... The results suggest that fluoride may be a developmental neurotoxicant that affects brain development at exposures much below those that can cause toxicity in adults ... 
Serum-fluoride concentrations associated with high intakes from drinking-water may exceed 1 mg/L, or 50 Smol/L, thus more than 1000-times the levels of some other neurotoxicants that cause neurodevelopmental damage. Supporting the plausibility of our findings, rats exposed to 1 ppm (50 Smol/L) of water-fluoride for one year showed morphological alterations in the brain and increased levels of aluminum in brain tissue compared with controls ... 
In conclusion, our results support the possibility of adverse effects of fluoride exposures on children&#39;s neurodevelopment. Future research should formally evaluate dose-response relations based on individual-level measures of exposure over time, including more precise prenatal exposure assessment and more extensive standardized measures of neurobehavioral performance, in addition to improving assessment and control of potential confounders.</p>

Here&#39;s what Philippe Grandjean, Adjunct Professor of Environmental Health at the Harvard School of Public Health, wrote about the misrepresentation of research he co-authored on the link between fluoride and lowered IQ in children.
&quot;neither [Kansas] newspaper checked their information with the authors, even though statements were attributed to them&quot;
&quot;On average, the children with higher fluoride exposure showed poorer intelligence test performance. The high exposures generally exceeded the concentrations normally occurring in fluoridated drinking water, but only 4 of 27 studies reached an excess of 10-fold, and clear differences were found also at much lower exposures.
Addition of fluoride to drinking water has been controversial since the very beginning in the 1940s. As noted in a National Research Council report, neither benefits nor risks have been thoroughly documented.&quot;
&quot;Chemical brain drain should not be disregarded. The average IQ deficit in children exposed to increased levels of fluoride in drinking water was found to correspond to about 7 points - a sizable difference. To which extent this risk applies to fluoridation in Wichita or Portland or elsewhere is uncertain, but definitely deserves concern.&quot;

    <div class="md"><p>Except the exposure was no where near lower levels and that&#39;s 100% bullshit.</p>

<p>The levels were at their lowest point 8-10 times higher, seriously read the study and find a single one that wasn&#39;t many times higher than you&#39;ll find here. i&#39;ll be waiting.</p>

<p>They did not account for any other factors.</p>

<p>At no point did they confirm ti was actually fluoride and said more research needed to be done.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say this again really slowly.</p>

<p>This man in no way said fluoride is toxic, he said more research is needed and trying to spin it any other way is complete bullshit.</p>

<p>Also because you decided against actually copy pasting what the man REALLY said here let me point that out &quot;F&#39;wit&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;-- When considering the risks and benefits of fluoride exposure, the level of intake needs to be
considered.
--Possible risks to brain development in children have been studied in China, but this possible hazard has
not received much, if any, consideration in the U.S.
--Our study summarized the findings of 27 studies on intelligence tests in fluoride-exposed children; 25
of the studies were carried out in China. On average, children with higher fluoride exposure showed
poorer performance on IQ tests. Fluoride released into the ground water in China in some cases greatly
exceeded levels that are typical in the U.S.
--In general, complete information was not available on these 27 studies, and some limitations were
identified.
--All but one of the 27 studies documented an IQ deficit associated with increased fluoride exposure.
--These results do not allow us to make any judgment regarding possible levels of risk at levels of
exposure typical for water fluoridation in the U.S. On the other hand, neither can it be concluded that no
risk is present. We therefore recommend further research to clarify what role fluoride exposure levels
may play in possible adverse effects on brain development, so that future risk assessments can properly
take into regard this possible hazard&quot;</p>

<p>Point out where he says fluoride is directly linked to lower IO.</p>

Here&#39;s what Philippe Grandjean, Adjunct Professor of Environmental Health at the Harvard School of Public Health, wrote about the misrepresentation of research he co-authored on the link between fluoride and lowered IQ in children.
&quot;neither [Kansas] newspaper checked their information with the authors, even though statements were attributed to them&quot;
&quot;On average, the children with higher fluoride exposure showed poorer intelligence test performance. The high exposures generally exceeded the concentrations normally occurring in fluoridated drinking water, but only 4 of 27 studies reached an excess of 10-fold, and clear differences were found also at much lower exposures.
Addition of fluoride to drinking water has been controversial since the very beginning in the 1940s. As noted in a National Research Council report, neither benefits nor risks have been thoroughly documented.&quot;
&quot;Chemical brain drain should not be disregarded. The average IQ deficit in children exposed to increased levels of fluoride in drinking water was found to correspond to about 7 points - a sizable difference. To which extent this risk applies to fluoridation in Wichita or Portland or elsewhere is uncertain, but definitely deserves concern.&quot;

<p>Find a single one of those Chinese studies with fluoride levels anywhere near as low as they are here.</p>

<p>Point out where he says fluoride is directly related to reduced IQ.</p>

<p>Mainly because you can&#39;t understand why dosage is important, nobody is saying fluoride isn&#39;t TOXIC they&#39;re saying it isn&#39;t toxic at the levels we&#39;re currently getting.</p>

<p>That may change with fluoride being more common in toothpaste, but it 100% isn&#39;t from the water supply.</p>

<p>I&#39;d be fully for more studies on the matter, but people like you making bullshit claims that fluoride reduces IQ are not acceptable.</p>

<p>There are a number of reasons why that clearly isn&#39;t the case, mainly because IQ has been on the rise in the US over the last 50 years.</p>

<p>If fluoride reduced IQ then that clearly wouldn&#39;t be the case considering we&#39;ve expanded the use of fluoride in that time.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll stand by my original claim that you&#39;re scientifically illiterate.</p>

<p>This study has added new knowledge on the fate and distribution of fluoride in the body. It has shown for the first time that fluoride readily accumulates in the human pineal gland although there was considerable inter-individual variation (14-875 mg F/kg). By old age, the average pineal gland contains about the same amount of fluoride as teeth (300 mg F/kg) since dentine and whole enamel contain 300 and 100 mg F/kg, respectively [Newbrun, 1986]. Unlike brain capillaries, pineal capillaries allow the free passage of fluoride through the endothelium. If there had been a bloodbrain barrier in the pineal, it would have prevented the passage of fluoride into the pinealocytes and the pineal fluoride content would have been similar to or lower than muscle. This was obviously not the case: the fluoride concentration of the pineal was significantly higher (p&lt;0.001) than muscle. The high fluoride levels in the pineal are presumably due to the large surface area of the HA crystallites both intra- and extracellularly. In addition, the pineal has a profuse blood flow and high capillary density; pineal blood flow (4 ml/min/g) is second only to the kidney [Arendt, 1995]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really? Wow. Mind posting some information that we can check out for ourselves. Maybe some study that looks at long term build up of fluoride in the human body. How about what happens to the fluoride when it enters the body, does it get flushed out of the system or build up in a specific organ? Cause if it builds up then no matter how minute the dose, over time it has a potential risk. Again, can we get some info?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My experience is merely anecdotal.  (Although there is plenty to read about it on many different websites.)  About 9 months ago, I had the same realization that OP had and I just began being more mindful of it and I began to meditate.  Since that time I feel more clear and intuitive and my friends and family have even mentioned it to me. </p>

<p>I am still a beginner and my mindfulness techniques certainly didn&#39;t turn me into a neurologist; however, it did make me happier and more clear.</p>

<p>The way I imagine it though is this:</p>

<p>Your pineal gland has cones and rods just like the retina does.  I imagine if you kept one eye shut for an extended period it would begin to atrophy just like anything else.  If after an extended period of time you could open it and begin to use it again and it would rehabilitate (just like anything else.)</p>

<p>We as a culture currently don&#39;t know how to use our pineal glands at all, and most believe the intentional <em>use</em> of it to be pseudoscience.  I believe that during meditation it is possible to activate your pineal gland and therefore use it and rehabilitate it, which <em>may</em> have the effect of &quot;de-calcifying&quot; it.  </p>

<p>Again, merely anecdotal. But to answer your question:  Yes I have put some thought into it.</p>
