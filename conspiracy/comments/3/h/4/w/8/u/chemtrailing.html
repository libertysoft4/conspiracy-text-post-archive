<p>Now, as far as I understand it&#39;s the act of spraying nano-particles of certain chemicals such as aluminium etc. into the atmosphere to &quot;combat&quot; global warming...</p>

<p>What exactly are the effects on our neurological systems from the spraying?</p>

<p>Right now, I&#39;m on holiday in Lithuania... I have never seen so much blatant spraying in my life... I lived in the UK where you see it now and then, I also lived in the US where it&#39;s a bit more noticeable... But here in LT... It&#39;s ridiculous. I&#39;ll post a few photos, but basically the skies in the mornings are clear blue, and then all of these planes start spraying in a unified pattern, then turn around and spray over the original trail and overtime the sky becomes this chemical haze... It&#39;s kind of shitty, I&#39;m noticing myself feeling drained or not necessarily 100%.</p>

<p>Thoughts about this?</p>

<p>It takes a special kind of logic to both believe that chemtrail spraying is done to &quot;save the world&quot; from global warming, then also believe they spray poison they themselves couldn&#39;t avoid while willfully ignoring the health risks.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Im going to assume by &quot;melt&quot; you mean something along the lines of dissipate, disperse, or even disappear...  Either way, contrails are fundamentally still clouds.  Obviously clouds hang around for a long time, and so can contrails (as they are mainly water vapor/ice crystals) in the right conditions, altitude, and temperature.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>So what you&#39;re saying is that ALL planes now spray &quot;chemtrails&quot; and you even wrapped in a classic false dilemma argument, nice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The grid is in the pictures.  And you can tell there were planes by the third picture - you can see a fresh trail.  This is like coming upon a freshly manicured lawn and knowing they used a lawnmower.  It follows logically.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What youre assuming is that it is the SAME plane, and <em>that</em> does <strong>not</strong> follow logically.  You said an unmarked plane, which none are even directly visible or discernible.  You also said its flying around in a grid, which is also improvable and an ASSUMPTION.  Its public airspace and there are literally hundreds of flights a day.</p>

<p>As for your lawn mower analogy, a more accurate equivalent would be coming upon the scene and saying, &quot;Those aren&#39;t grass clippings its thrown out, they are poisonous chemicals that look exactly like grass used to control the grass&#39; mind!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The pictures show a grid formation and the trails that look exactly like those that form in the skies above me (no matter which part of the US I happen to be in) and always come from unmarked whitish planes.  I know it&#39;s the same stuff because you can make out the layers and a new track from the pictures.  They are clouds, yes, but not clouds of water.</p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;ve also seen as many as 5 of these planes at one time so it&#39;s not necessarily the same plane going back and forth</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Using airplanes to slowly poison the population at an atmospheric level seems to me to be VERY inefficient especially when you consider the other ways they could introduce toxins.  (vaccines, drinking water, GMO&#39;s etc.)  </p>

<p>It seems to me that TPTB wouldn&#39;t bother with a project that was so inefficient and costly.  It leads me to believe that the chem trailing has another primary purpose that isn&#39;t population control.</p>

<p>Merely speculation but perhaps they are introducing a layer of a certain gas or combination of gasses to make holographic projection easier?  </p>

<p>Again I have no evidence, I just question why the super elite would suddenly adopt such a costly and redundant method of introducing toxins, when it seems that everything else they do is so calculated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean I&#39;ve seen a ton of documents and reviewed them with my peers and I&#39;ve conducted endless field testing with my own equipment (eyes) and I&#39;ve compared it to similar tests of my peers and we have concluded that chemtrails are obviously real and happen just about daily, at least across most major population centers.  Did that convince anyone?  Then why do people always ask for peer reviewed journals?  Truth should be evident and explainable, trust your eyes if you don&#39;t trust the pictures, there is a good chance that you live in an area that gets sprayed and just don&#39;t know what to look for</p>

<p>So I&#39;m guessing the answer is: no you don&#39;t have any peer reviewed studies supporting your assertions </p>

<p>Like I thought, you don&#39;t have any peer reviewed studies supporting your assertions </p>

<p>Don&#39;t be mad that people prefer facts and verified studies that can actually be quantified and the data reviewed over: hey I looked at it with my eyes and 9/11 was an inside job coz I looked at it with my eyes </p>

I even remember a newspaper commenting about chemtrailing.
Chemtrailing is widely used to make &quot;nice weather&quot; but in some countries in the EU it is forbidden like Germany.</p>
