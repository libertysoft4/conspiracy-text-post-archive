I would basically use it on someone who seemed suspicious, in order to see how much that user would participate in GMO-related threads.</p>

<p>I noticed that some of the suspicious users were also highly active in Clinton and Sanders threads (behaved as pro-Clinton/anti-Sanders). I also noticed something else, that some of them would participate in Pluto threads as well. It wasn&#39;t much, just a thread or so here and there, but it still seems kind of strange to me. I won&#39;t list the users this time, only the thread titles, but I&#39;m wondering if anyone has any theories about the interest in Pluto or any additional information. It could be nothing.</p>

<p>All of these users were either on the GMO/Monsanto list, close to it, and/or were just shilly enough for me to search them. (5 on the GMO/Monsanto list, 2 very close to it, 3 shilly)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP I gave this some thought and I have a theory.</p>

<p>Democratic candidates typically get scientifically-minded voters, at least as of late. The younger generation (18-30) has within it a fairly large subset which ascribes to a policy which could quickly be described as &quot;scientific evidence or gtfo&quot;.</p>

<p>Therefore appeasing them would mean giving them shallow, scientifically-oriented hypotheses they can easily debate and defend with their arm-chair knowledge. I readily admit, I&#39;m one of those youth. </p>

<p>In other terms, it&#39;s associating the notion of science and science discussion with the candidate, thereby making them seem subliminally more appealing to that particular scientifically-oriented subset of the young voters. Democrats rely on the youth - they elected Obama. If Hilary or Sanders gets elected, it&#39;ll have been the youth vote that brings them in. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="/u/BillionaireBob">/u/BillionaireBob</a> is a lot like me. He hovers around <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> because he&#39;s interested in conspiracy-type theories. I&#39;d be willing to bet he ascribes to certain ones. He&#39;d almost certainly admit that the JFK assassination, for instance, likely did not happen as the official story tells it. </p>

<p>The thing I&#39;ve noticed about him that&#39;s similar to myself is that he&#39;s an otherwise rational, well-thinking person. He&#39;s got a skeptical (yet open) mind, and he recognizes bunk for bunk. He just expects people to back up their assertions, and recognizes the signs of a person who isn&#39;t going to. Further (again, similar to myself), it&#39;s apparent to me that after it&#39;s been made clear that whomever he&#39;s talking to is not going to listen to reason (they&#39;re firmly planted in their line of thinking, regardless of evidence), <a href="/u/BillionaireBob">/u/BillionaireBob</a> will start tongue-in-cheek trolling. It&#39;s trolling in the sense that he&#39;s stopped giving a shit about what they&#39;re saying and he&#39;s just poking a few jabs at someone. &quot;Teasing&quot; would be a better definition, in my opinion.<sup>1</sup> </p>

<p>That being said, he&#39;s also usually a lot less verbal than I (being wordy is simultaneously a talent I&#39;m proud of, and also, a burden and a curse), but he&#39;s basically got the same idea. Remember I just said this, right?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p><a href="/u/BillionaireBob">/u/BillionaireBob</a> is one of those people too, though I don&#39;t know if he&#39;d admit it or not.<sup>2</sup> That&#39;s why he posts on many flat-earth theories. Remember: I said shallow, scientifically oriented hypotheses. I&#39;ve had and expressed a theory that the entire flat-earth nonsense is meant to distract that same scientifically-minded group (18-30) from discussing <em>legitimate</em> issues using those rational minds: issues such as world-banking, TPP, and the concept of &#39;terrorism&#39;. These &#39;theories&#39; – which is an affront to the word, being that they fly in the face of everything science knows – only serve as low-hanging fruit to take up the time of people who, while open to conspiracy theories, are also rational and educated folks. </p>

<p>Now this is all just an armchair-view from one regular <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> poster to another regular <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> poster. Take it with a grain of salt. I could be totally off-base. He might just be some shill, or some SJW, or some Jew, or some Rothschild, or some <em>[insert whatever bogeyman you care to have here]</em>. I don&#39;t know him. I just know what I&#39;ve seen on this subreddit over the past half-a-year. There&#39;s about 50-100 on/off people who post/argue/retort/etc, and you can pretty clearly divide them along certain lines, scientific inquiry being one of them. The rest are mostly just lurking and/or passing users – ones who don&#39;t stick around very long. </p>

<p><sup>1.</sup> <sup>A troll is someone who tries to conceal the fact that they <em>are</em> teasing [or more destructive purposes]. This user doesn&#39;t try to conceal that, unless you consider the lack of an &quot;/s&quot; to be &#39;deceptive&#39;.</sup></p>

<p><sup>2</sup> <sup>I welcome the discussion Bob - we&#39;ve never really chatted, despite often being pitted against the same ignorant ideas.</sup></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whoa! Are you two best friends?! lol! Just playing!</p>

<p>Yea, it&#39;s even more interesting because he participates in threads both on here and <a href="/r/theworldisflat">/r/theworldisflat</a>. I think the theory is curious and interesting to think about, but I don&#39;t seek all the threads about them. I could understand if he did believe in the theory, even a little.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not claiming that he&#39;s anything. I was just wondering. </p>

<p>And usually when I see aggressive or mean comments that don&#39;t really add to the discussion, I get suspicious. It also doesn&#39;t help that the only two users I searched from this thread based off of that, both happened to be active in flat-earth theory threads, which to me isn&#39;t really a common theory to discuss, yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s my hypothesis:</p>

<p>A number of the people on your GMO Shill list (like me) have publicly declared that they have or are engaged in a formal education in the sciences. (One of the users on your list is an actual honest to god astronomer.)</p>

<p>If these people are actually students of science as they claim, and they are <em>anything</em> like my friends from college (who are all huge science nerds) then of course they&#39;d be interested in Pluto- because of its unique place in our solar system and the fact that this mission is the closest look we&#39;ve ever gotten at Pluto. It&#39;s kind of a big deal. All of my friends are following the current Pluto mission very closely.</p>

<p>As far as the Clinton/Sanders thing- Clinton and Sanders are two of the most prominent contestants for the Democratic nomination. Sanders has a serious anti-GMO bent, which is not going to set well with the science crowd in general. So if you&#39;re pro-GMO (or at least anti-anti-GMO) the likelihood of you supporting Sanders will be diminished.</p>

<p>If all of this is correct, it lends credence to the explanation that the people on your GMO Shill list are just a bunch of people who are really really interested in science and casts doubt on the assumption that they&#39;re getting paid by Monsanto to post about GMOs on reddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How so?</p>

<p>Scientists are used to looking at and evaluating evidence and then coming to conclusions based off of that evidence. Why would the &quot;science crowd&quot; be anti-GMO when the evidence overwhelmingly is in favor of GMO safety?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really interested in science, but spreads misinformation, manipulates the public, and operate similarly to a gang. 3 out of that list may not completely fit the pattern (you being one; I haven&#39;t analyzed as much simply because you haven&#39;t been in the debate recently), as for the rest, I wonder if you&#39;ve actually watched how they work.</p>

<p>Thanks for sharing your theory though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mountain ranges are not always made with tectonic forces or an active core. Tectonics easily makes mountains, but so do sufficiently large impacts. </p>

<p>Also, any mountain featured on a dwarf planet would appear larger (more like a &#39;range&#39;) due to the smaller globular sphere. </p>

<p>Just like why the moon appears bigger near the horizon, it&#39;s all relative to perspective.</p>

<p>This is an interesting post nonetheless.</p>

How are they going to keep us down on the plantation if we discover our ancestors were a class one civilization; we&#39;d start asking a lot of questions they really don&#39;t want to answer, and things could get ugly for them.</p>

<p>As far as <a href="/u/s70n3834r">/u/s70n3834r</a>&#39;s civilization theory, enjoy it as the imaginative science fiction that it is. There&#39;s no basis in it, scientific or otherwise.
