<p>This is crazy considering what happened the other day in China.  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/11739009/Two-blasts-in-French-chemical-plant-caused-by-malicious-act.html">I also want to remind people that last month there was a chemical plant attack in France</a> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The probability that these two fires in tanks 500 metres (1,640 feet) apart could be accidental is very low. Investigators are leaning towards the theory of a voluntary act,&quot; another informed source told AFP. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So that&#39;s 3 chemical plant fires in 3 different countries in a span of 2 months...  Something ain&#39;t right here.  Anyone else notice any weird patterns of &quot;accidents&quot; coincidentally happening in multiple countries in a short period of time?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jep, oddly there seems to be no reports on American media of this. If it had to be guessed, probably because Sweden and Finland are unaligned and neutral Countries that remain that way during wartime so not too popular and people tend to avoid reporting on Sweden or Finland.</p>

<p>Plus in Finlands case, we are huge trolls. Case in point; <a href="http://36.media.tumblr.com/94b800966d83f82bbec7336e20ec96f4/tumblr_n1ter21hxp1so4xnko1_1280.jpg">http://36.media.tumblr.com/94b800966d83f82bbec7336e20ec96f4/tumblr_n1ter21hxp1so4xnko1_1280.jpg</a> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL that&#39;s an awesome news caption, but Finland&#39;s gonna have to up its troll game to compete with Sweden.</p>

<p>&quot;Sweden is not a member of NATO and spends a relatively small amount on its military. How could it hope to deter the Russian navy on its own? The answer, according to one Swedish group, is simple: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/05/12/swedens-new-message-to-russian-submarines-this-way-if-you-are-gay/">The Swedes must send out gay propaganda via Morse code</a></p>

<p>I think the media is blacking out this information because there&#39;s a hidden World War going on.  These tit-for-tat attacks keep happening but no government wants to make a big deal about it because then they&#39;d be expected to do something about it.  If the news mentions a terrorist attack you&#39;d pretty much bet there would be a response.  An industrial &quot;accident&quot;?  Meh</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s interesting to note that the French explosion the authorities are calling a likely attack.  And if the plant in China was &quot;clearly violating safety rules&quot; then it makes it even easier for an attack to be successful.  Don&#39;t know myself, hope it&#39;s all nothing, but I&#39;ve listed 3 chemical plant &quot;incidents&quot; in the OP and thanks to the fine readers of r/conspiracy 2 more in the last week have been brought to attention.  </p>

<p>Once is an accident. Twice is coincidence. Three times is an enemy action.  What happens after 5 times?</p>

<p>Three times ... anywhere in the world? Are you serious? There are fires and explosions at chemical factories somewhere in the world <em>every</em> month.</p>

<p>The explosion in China was <em>huge</em>, but something like what happened in Conroe, Texas is not unusual. There&#39;s nothing to connect the three incidents you mention, or the other ones mentioned by people here.</p>

<p><a href="http://maps.clb.org.hk/accidents/en#">This site</a> lists about <a href="http://i.imgur.com/2p9Mq9s.png">three fatal workplace explosions</a> per month <em>in China alone</em>. Most of them don&#39;t make the English-language news.</p>

<p>Lest you think I&#39;m exaggerating that there is at least one fire at a chemical plant each month, here&#39;s a sample:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look at the link I posted about the french chemical plant explosion.  The authorities in that case have called it an attack.  Maybe not every chemical plant incident is an attack but so many incident bunched up is suspicious</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you think the EPA chemical in the Animas River has anything to do with this?  For sure this seems really wierd.  All while Trump and Hillary keep our eyes and our media on them?  What&#39;s horrible, imo, is that the EPA said that the rivers effected are almost back to pre-event condition.  How can that be as they have done nothing to clean it up and the indigenous peoples have been asking for a state of emergency because of this.  That doesn&#39;t sound like it&#39;s back to pre-event  condition me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I think the EPA thing is unrelated.  <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-08-14/geologist-who-predicted-colorado-river-disaster-interviewed-slams-deceptive-epa">Here&#39;s an article about it about a geologist who predicted this would happen</a> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The EPA was basically deceptive. They were saying we’re going to plug the Red and Bonita mine with a hydrostatic reinforced concrete plug, then we’re going to see what will happen, Taylor says in an exclusive interview with Breitbart News.
The Gold King mine was already plugged by someone else years ago with wood timbers, rocks and mud, and it was exfiltrating an unknown quantity of water, and they decided to remove that old plug so they could see the true quantity of water it was leaking, according to Taylor.
That old plug in the Gold King mine was kind of unstable material, he notes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“It was incompetent and stupid for them to go up to that existing plug and try to remove it without knowing how much water was upstream and behind it and what the hydrostatic pressure was,” Taylor says.</p>

<p>“The plug was stable until they fooled around with it. Once they disturbed it, that’s what activated the blowout,” he adds.</p>
