    <div class="md"><p>Remove the sticky. It&#39;s an abuse of mod powers to sticky something like that. Possible equivalents I can imagine would be stickying a post about flat earth or a post about Iranian nukes. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not a meta <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> post. It&#39;s not alarming groundbreaking news. Imagine if they stickied a transgender genital reassignment surgery post.</p>

<p>Let the community decide what makes the front page, not the moderators. Oh wait. I forgot I was on reddit. Carry on. This place sucks.</p>

<p>What makes me uncomfortable is abuse of mod powers. Hierarchy. Power. Abuse. All kinda go hand in hand. I&#39;m sick of it all.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s unpopular it gets downvoted. That&#39;s reddit rules. Just because one mod can sticky their unpopular post, doesn&#39;t make it right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey,</p>

<p>While I appreciate how passionate you are about conspiracy, you need to understand that the whole modus operandi here is that we are trying to maintain an environment where subjects that are taboo almost everywhere on reddit are able to be discussed here.</p>

<p>We unstuck the post because it had its time in the light and was discussed a lot.  I wanted to stick the post because every time the subject gets posted its pounced upon with downvotes and shunned out of view by very politically minded people who passionately feel like we shouldn&#39;t discuss the topic of &quot;What if there are abortion practices we should be ashamed of as a society?&quot; </p>

<p>I&#39;m pro choice man, but that doesn&#39;t mean i&#39;m okay with some weird shit evolving where these tissue donations becoming more important than the woman having a choice to carry a child to term or not.  It would be a terrible thing if women felt like they couldnt get an early term abortion because of the stigma of people who wait for 20 weeks or more.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think anyone here would stand up in a room and say &quot;I think partial birth abortions are just fine&quot; there is a limit, and we don&#39;t need to be afraid to discuss it.</p>

<p>We should watch over these practices, they should feel pressure to not take things too far because there is always those people who will take it too far if no one is looking.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re sick of seeing things that you don&#39;t like then don&#39;t click it.</p>

<p>I dont think that&#39;s very good logic. If we are just sticking posts based on the inflammatory nature of the post, instead of what is going to cause the most awareness I think the point of this sub is being missed.</p>

<p>I feel like its up to all of us help each other awaken from our programming. If we are focusing on hot topics that dont improve our ability to be truth seekers then really what we are doing is pandering to peoples emotions prevents people from making informed choices. We are no better than fox news if we cannot act to make the world better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>because every time someone links it, its gets hidden by instant wave of down votes and snarky comments from suspiciously new users that don&#39;t frequent here.</p>

<p>I think the same thing can be said for the reaction to the sticky.</p>

<p>The sticky generated a robust conversation so it clearly a topic some people want to talk about,  They can&#39;t do that if it gets buried in 20 seconds, so we kept it up for some hours and it was talked about.</p>

<p>We do this from time to time for various topics.</p>
