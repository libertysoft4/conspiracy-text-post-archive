        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Ok so it&#39;s pretty clear that the stickied post about planned parenthood is an agenda being pushed by certain mods here. The fact that a) a majority of the users in the thread want it to be unstickied, and b) it was at 0 karma last I checked, should warrant its removal</p>

<p>The users have spoken. And that&#39;s what this site is for, right? The users? </p>

<p>It&#39;s obvious manipulation of he sub and like others have noticed and pointed out its occurring around the same time as last year; around 9/11. Same exact pattern. </p>

<p>I never got involved in the reddit drama and mod abuses and all that, as I wasn&#39;t close to the situation. But I followed that thread since the min it was posted. I saw how a few users, lead by fly tape, manipulated the conversation. Anybody questioning why the video was stickied or questioning the content of the video itself was labeled an &quot;abortion lover&quot; and &quot;evil&quot;....</p>

<p>The users wanting the thread to be unstickied probably outnumber those who want it 3 to 1. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not suggesting the thread be taken down. I&#39;m against censorship. But the thread should only appear at the top of the sub based on its own merit, not because the mods feel it&#39;s important. </p>

<p>This community is falling apart, and it&#39;s hardly the typical users&#39; fault. We need to move IMO. </p>

<p>Sorry it was a bit of a rant post, but I felt like enough people were questioning the post and why it was stickied.</p>

<p>EDIT: the post has had the sticky removed.</p>

<p>Right now, only 3 mods need to OK a post for a sticky. I&#39;ve made the suggestion that <em>5</em> mods need to give the go ahead in the future. </p>

<p>I voted against this sticky, but it had already reached 3 and the decision was made.</p>

<p>Since 5 mods aren&#39;t always active at once, this will ensure that some time passes to make sure that everything is on the up and up and the right decision is being made for the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> community.</p>

<p>Hopefully this will prevent further problems.</p>

<p>I think the issue alot of people have with it is the image it gives to the outside about how serious and note-worthy our sub is. They presumably feel this is average content not worthy of broadcasting to the broader viewer base as a post we want highlighted.</p>

<p>I have not downvoted or upvoted your comments and I&#39;m sorry you are being targeted. As far as I&#39;m concerned we are having a balanced debate.</p>
