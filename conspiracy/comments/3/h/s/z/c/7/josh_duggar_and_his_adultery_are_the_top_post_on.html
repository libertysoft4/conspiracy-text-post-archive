    <div class="md"><p>Fuck yeah that&#39;s news. Josh Duggar was the head of the political lobbying arm of the Family Research Council, which fought against same sex marriage and opposes abortion, pornography, stem cell research, divorce and publicly denies climate change. In other words, he was a leader of a fundamentalist Christian group which claims to fight against &quot;immorality&quot; and seeks to influence national politics all the while he was cheating on his wife. Big name politicians supported him and some, like Mike Huckabee, continued to support him even after the news broke out that he had molested his own sisters and several other underage girls when he was younger.</p>

<p>This is important news because it says a lot about Christian fundamentalist politicians and people who run these Christian fundamentalist organizations. Most of em are hypocrites!</p>

<p>This part I get, to a degree I really didn&#39;t wish I had to but I did grow up in such an environment/family. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Its fine if people are hypocrites. Its not fine if they are trying to change America to follow a narrative that they themselves cant follow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This part is where it gets sinister though. It&#39;s the difference between:</p>

<ul>
<li>I grew up in a Christian family, realized I was gay, hid it for a while but eventually came to terms with it</li>
<li>I grew up in a Christian family, realized I was gay, hid it indefinitely, went into politics and tried to enact legislation restricting or harming gays</li>
</ul>

<p>I wish I was making that scenario about repressed politicians up but it&#39;s happened far too many times now to be funny anymore. Josh Duggar basically did the same thing, except he did it by preaching core family values and traditional marriage.....all while screwing around both with/on his family and marriage. I can understand having secrets, but when you devote your life/career to things that are opposite in every way what you&#39;re actually doing secretly, that takes hypocrite to a new level.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty much. </p>

<p>If someone is preaching a position where cheating on their spouse is wrong, yet they can&#39;t live by that rule themselves, the answer is not just say &quot;Oh well. I should just keep holding people accountable to a standard I myself can&#39;t achieve.&quot;</p>

<p>The answer is to take a real long look at that position and have an honest conversation with ourselves. </p>

<p>To continue the example, the conversation should no longer be about whether cheating is right or wrong, but rather speaking honestly with ourselves about our ability to stay monogamous before making that level of commitment to another human. </p>

We get tired, angry, frustrated, whatever, and make poor choices. Also, if you look, those who sound off the loudest about what other people should stop doing are very often guilty of that action and simply not at peace with themselves about it. Telling everyone they should not do &quot;x&quot; is them trying to convince themselves to stop. Humans.  ¯\_ (ツ)_/¯</p>

<p>Yes.  That&#39;s the whole fucking point of being a leader.  Live true to yourself and if you&#39;re going to hold every human to a certain standard, then you better fucking well be living to that standard too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand you completely. What you don&#39;t understand is that &quot;should&quot; and reality, often do not intersect. If you try and live in the world of &quot;should&quot;, you are being completely disconnected from what is actually happening. Let&#39;s say that EVERYONE took your position, and would never put themselves in a position of leadership on any given subject in the first place unless they be the perfect ideal. Only, no one on Earth can actually be an ideal, because we&#39;re all human. So now what? We have no leaders? That&#39;s ridiculous. People look for leaders and are willing to accept less than ideal people as leaders everywhere, everyday. Taking that reality, and now declaring those normal people who are being looked to as leaders, must now magically transform themselves into perfect ideals is asinine. Get it out of your system. There is nothing wrong with holding people accountable for failures and deception, but seriously - get a grip yo&#39;.</p>

<p>In my 20&#39;s I had an experience that lead me to believe that no human being should physically hit/harm another human being unless it is in defense.  Since then I have punched/kicked/hit/harmed exactly 0 people, unless it was in the name of defending myself or someone else.  So sign me up.  I&#39;ll be a leader in that regard.  You seem to already believe that I&#39;m going to fail, just by being human.  I reject that, as you have no grounds for it.  You are judging me on a failure I haven&#39;t even committed yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hipocrite? Try child molesting piece of garbage that should be force fed his own cock. </p>

<p>I have none of Jesus&#39; s ability or urge to forgive those who rape children. I find him morally repugnant for teaching the world it was okay.</p>

<p>Forgiveness is christianity&#39;s greatest appeal and the curse they brought upon the world.  I don&#39;t believe in forgiveness, the world would be a better place if everybody paid for what they did.</p>

<p>Most Christians are hypocrites, that&#39;s no insult, it&#39;s their culture.  This motherfucker sexually assaulted his little sisters.</p>

<p>You are the one who is underreacting. No amount of hate is too much hate for people like this. His death would make the world a better place.</p>

<p>And I hope he reads this and kills himself, but he won&#39;t because he&#39;s already forgiven himself. He would just chuckle and talk about how he prays for my immortal soul. </p>

<p>I&#39;d rather go to hell then to a heaven where he&#39;s welcome.</p>

<p>I have a theory that if Christians are right, all the good people are in hell. Maybe the Gnostics were right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are <em>everywhere</em> now.  Way worse than even a year ago.  All of the ELI5 posts in the top 100 have artificially promoted, usually highly inaccurate responses at the head of the comments.  See: the current bullshit about CC refunds taking longer for any logistical reason, when it does indeed happen due to interest on ledgers and lack of legal mandate for speedier transactions.</p>

<p>Also, regarding the Ashley Madison hack, it seems to be another expensive manufactured story designed to distract and sell.  Gawker has a post up about how some recent inorganic viral miscarriage couple is involved, and the Duggars are constantly promoted via their TLC reality show.  The whole thing is a dendritic structure designed to spawn as many vignettes as possible for a few hundred thousand pageviews here and there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excuse me, but I care deeply... DEEPLY about these issues which most of have no business being the business of modern politicians in a SECULAR democracy, and yet they are the same issues that people base their democratic votes on. </p>

<p>So, yeah, I care when influential people that are working against the freedoms of Americans are god-damned hypocrites that somehow seemingly affect the policies and people that are making decisions on the behalf of innocent people that don&#39;t support a religious-based government.</p>

<p>Calling us sheep for caring is like telling a person on fire that they shouldn&#39;t be concerned about hearing fire alarms. This affects us directly through the cultural chain of events, so yes, we are more than justified in caring.</p>

<p>And I&#39;m not sure who &quot;they&quot; are. The media just taking advantage of the celebrity gossip of it can fuck off, but anyone else that understand the ramifications is legit in reporting this.</p>

<p>Edit to say: All that being said, I am deeply upset that some criminals decided to invade the privacy of free adults to leak this information out. That is beyond reprehensible, and Josh Duggar&#39;s privacy should never have been invaded in this way, and it&#39;s absolutely disgusting. Unfortunately, he chose a life in the media which opened him up for this type of exposure. It&#39;s unfortunate that this important information was obtained this way rather than shared by himself or his wife, but it&#39;s out there and deserves to be known. Truly, the biggest evil of this story is the hackers, and I hope they are caught and justice is served.</p>

So, yeah, <em>once again</em>, here&#39;s a moral scold who was paid money from a Christian foundation, who turned around and spent that Jesus money trying to cheat on his wife.  </p>

<p>He&#39;s getting well-deserved attention for being a hypocrite; in my opinion, if you push your religious ideology into the political sphere, and then you fall from grace while trying to legislate morality into everyone around you while blatantly doing the opposite in your personal life, you shouldn&#39;t just get that story blasted all over the news, you should get chained to a pillory so people can throw rotten fruit at you, like they did in Puritan New England.</p>

<p>I mean, he&#39;s one of the people trying to drag us back to 1692, so let&#39;s embroider a goddamned scarlet &quot;A&quot; on his shirt so he can live the fantasy for real.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your position is bleak, depressing, and in my opinion completely out of touch.  It also sounds like you&#39;re a christian, as your default viewpoint is that humans are incapable of living by their own convictions.  Do you like that about yourself?  Assuming that every person you know is going to let you or themselves down?</p>

<p>In my 20&#39;s I had an experience that lead me to believe that no human being should physically hit/harm another human being unless it is in defense.  Since then I have punched/kicked/hit/harmed exactly 0 people, unless it was in the name of defending myself or someone else.  So sign me up.  I&#39;ll be a leader in that regard.  You seem to already believe that I&#39;m going to fail, just by being human.  I reject that, as you have no grounds for it.  You are judging me on a failure I haven&#39;t even committed yet.</p>

<p>Do you understand why that is so evil and despicable?  Do i need to spell that out even further?</p>
