What do you guys think when people mock your beliefs and say things like &quot;JET FUEL CAN&#39;T MELT STEEL BEAMS&quot; mockingly towards you? How do you explain to them your beliefs and how do you typically react both online and in real life when people mock your stance on 9/11? Just a bit curious. Props.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>-JET FUEL CAN&#39;T MELT STEEL BEAMS LOL</p>

<p>-Well, can it?</p>

<p>-No, twoofer. It can weaken them to the point of collapse, though.</p>

<p>-Then what was that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmuzyWC60eE">sparky glowing molten metal pouring out of the south tower</a>? It sure looks an awful lot like the molten iron byproduct of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3ZkoNF2ybg">thermite</a>.</p>

<p>-Aluminum allow from the airplane, dummy. It came from the hole made by the airplane.</p>

<p>-Molten aluminum is silvery.</p>

<p>-LOL you&#39;re so dumb! Look at these pictures from dimly lit foundries and factories of molten aluminum! look how bright that glows, and at hundreds of degrees less than iron!</p>

<p>-Those photographs are from dimly lit foundries and factories. This stuff was glowing almost white hot in the morning sun, and it stayed that way while falling <a href="http://www.debunking911.com/Moltenal.jpg">hundreds of feet</a> down. Aluminum would have to be heated hundreds of degrees past it&#39;s white-hot point or it would still just look silvery when it&#39;s poured hundreds of feet down in the morning sun.  </p>

<p>-Well, it may have been molten lead from a room that stored lead batteries near the impact point.</p>

<p>-Same story with lead.  </p>

<p>-Anyway, you can&#39;t judge what type of metal it is just by looking at it! </p>

<p>-Then what else could it be?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You probably are suffering from an illusion that 9/11 truth is somehow unpopular.</p>

<p>The population is essentially divided into two categories now:</p>

<p>(1) 9/11 truthers</p>

<p>(2) people who have never given it much thought</p>

<p>I explicitly don&#39;t include people who have investigated 9/11 and come to the official story narrative.  These people don&#39;t exist in the real world.  Maybe 1 in 1,000.  Definitely not even 1% of the population.</p>

<p>In the past, most people were #2.  These days, most people are #1.  #2 is actually pretty common still though.  My best guess would be something like 40% of the population at this point.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never discussed 9/11 with anyone in #2 and them walk away without joining the #1 camp in person in the last 5 years.  It happened a couple of times well into the past with a few people who were particularly emotionally raw about it (family members actively deployed with 9/11 as a justification or something like that).</p>

<p>On the internet, people (government trolls) pretend they still believe the 9/11 fairytale after evidence is presented to the contrary.  We can confidently know these are just trolls because no one believes the government narrative in the real world.  It&#39;s just a media illusion you still have because you don&#39;t have the social and intellectual competency to have real conversations in real life.</p>

<p>Anyway, I think of &quot;jet fuel can&#39;t melt steel beams&quot; as a nice meme.  It&#39;s good to keep the fact that the 9/11 fairytale is precisely that in the forefront of people&#39;s minds.  We still have an unfortunately large percentage of people that have never looked into it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why did a few weakened steel beams and trusses cause the top of the building to fall at constant acceleration? Common sense would say things would say the floors above would slow down in the process of colliding with hundreds of floors of healthy structure below. </p>

<p>Take <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiHeCjZlkr8">this</a> controlled demolition for instance. 5 floors in the middle part of the building are collapsed with hydraulics, so after they go off the relatively healthy top and bottom portion can mutually destroy each other. The top of the building slows down once it hits the healthy structure below. Why didn&#39;t the top portion of the Twin Towers slow down? That probably shouldn&#39;t have happened even if the columns and beams around the impact point were instantly turned to dust.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, this page raises doubts that thermite could be used to cut a steel beam. This was shown to be wrong in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPs25Jj8_As">S01E02 of Jesse Ventura&#39;s <em>Conspiracy Theory</em></a> and one year later (with regular thermite made in a guy&#39;s backyard) in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5d5iIoCiI8g">this video</a>. Oh, and one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Ride#History">Sky Ride</a> towers built for the World&#39;s Fair in Chicago were demolished with 1,500 pounds of thermite charges in 1933, an event that was ironically <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=xd0DAAAAMBAJ&amp;amp;lpg=PA657&amp;amp;vq=skyride%20tower&amp;amp;pg=PA657#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false">covered in Popular Mechanics</a> magazine at the time. </p>

<p>It also doesn&#39;t address the basic argument that molten aluminum or lead would need to be far, far hotter in order to glow in the morning sun and stay glowing hundreds of feet down. There also appears to be sparks around the fountain of molten metal. It&#39;s basic rebuttal against the molten material flowing out of the south tower being iron is that it would&#39;ve taken too much thermite to be practical. </p>

<p><em>&quot;when you realize how big the towers were, the slugs were fairly large. It must have been in the thousands of pounds.</em>&quot; This is a valad point, especially considering that even less nano-thermite would probably be needed to cut steel than regular thermite or thermate. But as shown before, 1,500 pounds of (regular) thermite charges were used on a light steel structure to simply make it tip over. Regular thermite could&#39;ve been used to keep the towers on fire (most of the the water sprinkler system hadn&#39;t failed by then), as some arsonists have done. Who knows.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a success. </p>

<p>For the first ten years after 9/11, the first thing you would hear asking why and how the towers fell was &quot;the jet fuel melted the steel.&quot; And there are actual experts - structural engineers, professors, knowledgeable people! - on record with this theory. It was widely circulated as early as September 12th, 2001, and was still around in ~2006. </p>

<p>&quot;Jet fuel can&#39;t melt steel beams&quot; is a small victory in a great battle, because you can watch the hivemind educating itself: &quot;don&#39;t say jet fuel melted the steel, it makes you look stupid, and those twoofers are going to rip you apart. Because jet fuel can&#39;t melt steel beams - except if in stoichiometric mixture with air. Were the towers blast furnaces or smelting ovens? No. Jet fuel can&#39;t melt steel beams.&quot;</p>

<p>Now it&#39;s &quot;it only has to weaken it enough&quot; and &quot;we never said&quot; and &quot;muh strawman fallacy&quot;. </p>

<p>So: jet fuel can&#39;t melt steel beams. And if you build a tower, pick up its top 1/4, and drop it on the lower 3/4 - <a href="/r/towerchallenge">what happens</a>?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The bottom line is that the story we are given violates physics in at least 3 different ways so it cannot be true.</p>

<p>It violates conservation of momentum due to the tilting portion of the south tower ceasing its sideways momentum.</p>

<p>It violates the fact that material falls in the direction of least resistance. It never falls in the direction of most resistance.</p>

<p>In a gravity fueled collapse the floors would have no energy source to move any one floor out from under the ones above.</p>

<p>They would necessarily stack up on the ground in the order they fell in.</p>

<p>What fell to the ground was not a stack of crushed floors. It was  shrapnel.</p>

<p>Shrapnel is caused by explosives. Gravity would cause layers.</p>

<p>Which one do you see?</p>

<p>Because of clear evidence seen above, gravity absolutely did not cause the collapses.</p>

<p>Happy people took notice. As they say &quot;Any press is good press&quot;. Steel melted and the lack of explanation requires an investigation.  </p>

<p>I explain it like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vczx8ETKg-g?t=59">&quot;Jet fuel melts steel beams&quot;</a>  </p>
