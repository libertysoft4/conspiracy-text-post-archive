    <div class="md"><p>Artificially low interest rates, @ 0% for the last several years, is the epitome of a managed economy. Lenders borrow money at no cost, and allow citizens and businesses alike buy anything and everything at manufactured prices. How is that not managing the economy?
     The FED literally manages the value of the dollar. And don&#39;t forget about how the federal government FORCES business owners to pay a mandatory minimum wage.

<p>Sorry, I think you have misunderstood me here - when you try to manage an economy that is designed to be managed from the start it works, when you try to manage an economy that has been designed as a free market system from the beginning, it doesn&#39;t work as well.</p>

<p>My point is that Free Market Capitalist economies are not designed from the start to be managed, and attempts to do so have failed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is that why the Soviet Union, an economy managed from the start, failed spectacularly? Managed economies end in complete failure, every time, no matter what.</p>

<p>People are not smart enough to allocate resources across an entire economy effectively. There will always be imbalances that cannot be accounted for from the central governing body. Look up the holodomor. Millions dead because of unintended consequences across a managed economy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow. You&#39;re grasping at straws by saying Iraq and Vietnam and the deaths from these wars are a failing of capitalism. By the time these wars started, the US was already a de facto oligarchy, and was moving towards the textbook definition of fascism, which is when business interests have a large influence on government policy, which is very evident in the case of the Iraq war. Blood for oil.</p>

<p>These were imperialist wars, using the government&#39;s military strength to aid business interests, and to &quot;slow the spread of communism&quot; in the case of vietnam.</p>

<p>These wars were atrocious, yes, but have absolutely nothing to do with what we&#39;re discussing.</p>

<p>The holodomor was a direct failing of communism and a great example of how misdirection of resources from a centrally planned governing body can lead to calamity. Your &quot;examples&quot; don&#39;t have anything to do with the misdirection of resources in an economy, which was what we were previously discussing.</p>

<p>If anything, your examples point to failures of over-reaching governments thinking they know what&#39;s best for everyone. Another example of failure from a centrally planned governing body. You basically proved my point while trying to defend your own.</p>

<p>But what will happen shortly after a market crash is that companies will close down, the companies that haven&#39;t closed down will have massive layoffs but the thing that is going to <strong>piss off</strong> millions of Americans is that everyone&#39;s 401K is going to plummet in value.  This will piss off the people who are ready to retire soon and this will piss off the people who heavily contribute to their 401K thinking that this is a good idea only to see their precious retirement money go down the drain. </p>

<p>The stock market is a fucking bullshit system and practically every type of retirement plan is tied to the stock market. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, think about it. Do you own stocks? Do I? I don&#39;t, and anybody that is currently in the stock market should know better than to gamble. If the stock market crashes, people still have to eat. They still need the necessities of life. If corporations go under, that would be great because it would create a million opportunities for people to start small businesses supplying the necessities of life. So, the stock market crash is a good thing. Now, the collapse of the dollar? That is entirely a different matter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If it was me? I would cash out and pay the taxes on any money I made. But that is me. 23 stock markets around the world have just crashed. Wall Street is not far behind. It&#39;s not worth the gamble. If you have made money, great!! Don&#39;t be greedy, hoping it will go back up. Greed is what causes people to lose everything. I got a good tip on a quartz mine in North Carolina that is for sale for $100 million, and the Russians may buy it. A person could make a fortune with a small investment.
