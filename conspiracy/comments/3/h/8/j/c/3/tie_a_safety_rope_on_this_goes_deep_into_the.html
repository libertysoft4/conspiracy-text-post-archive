        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have always liked conspiracy theories and have heard quite a few of them. There might be so many that you could hear of a new one every day. Some are pretty out there and some seem to almost hit you flush in the intuition. My favorite thing about conspiracies is when two or more seemingly separate theories go hand-in-hand with one another and seem to almost legitimatize each other. I&#39;m not sure if this is an original idea or not but I haven&#39;t really heard or seen it anywhere before but I have come up with a theory that, in all honesty, seems like a plot for a Sci-fi channel movie. But these theories are fun. Add, take away, and give me some feed back on this please:</p>

<p>Two common conspiracies I hear are about a former mass extinction(definitely has happened, but how is normally played with) and the Illuminati. When I use Illuminati here, I mean the Marvel-esque superior beings running the show from behind the scenes idea. One common theme in Illuminati conspiracy is the underground civilization. There are even other theories that aren&#39;t Illuminati, world controller based that reference underground civilizations.</p>

<p>Well here is what I thought about. Today, we know that there are underground shelters for some sort of apocalypse. Whether that be nuclear fall out or natural disasters, many of the world&#39;s most powerful people are ready to set up shop underground. What&#39;s to say there wasn&#39;t once a civilization as advanced, if not more, as we are? We see more and more signs every day that ancient cultures were a lot more advanced than we thought. I couldn&#39;t give a time line or specific disaster that might have been the one but just some time in history, however ancient, and a disaster was coming that was gonna wipe out the entire surface population. </p>

<p>You can imagine if that were to happen today our world leaders and most powerful would know of it coming and would have a way to survive. Underground bunkers, some even the size of cities. They would be the few remaining living beings on earth with a history of ruling and leading. </p>

<p>Sorry if the theory seems choppy or hard to follow. I am still playing with it and molding it. I hope you all can see the story I&#39;m trying to paint. This is where I could use a little help. Would that ruling elite stay underground and rule from there once surface life started flourishing again? Maybe they did resurface but have thousands and thousands of years worth of hidden knowledge and basically started a hand-crafted civilization that could be tricked into believing their past was what ever the fuck TPTB told them. Are those in power at the top now descendants from a once ruling elite that had at least hundreds of years underground to think about how to rule the surface population once the time came? They would have been the only people with any knowledge of what the fuck is actually going on. </p>

<p>If you all know anyone that has talked about a similar theory please share. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Human beings were not the first intelligent life forms native to our planet, which we now call Earth. </p>

<p>Undoubtedly they are planning something, or at least know what will occur in the future. Otherwise the DUMBS (Deep Underground Military Base) would not be constructed, so large and plentiful. </p>

<p>Do they plan to control from below? It&#39;s likely. Holographic technology allows full body holograms that look as real as an actual human. They won&#39;t have a need to come to the surface.</p>

<p>There was an super advanced civilization before the common era. The Egyptians called them Neteru, and they worshiped them as living God&#39;s. These Neteru claimed to have sailed from a distant land, and gave the Egyptians knowledge they had learned, and even mated with the natives. 
They are commonly associated with the hieroglyphics featuring large, almost giant like humanoids with elongated skulls. A lot of their bones have been found, reinforcing the notion. </p>

<p>I do believe Antarctica is tied into this, somehow, someway. 
It is said these Neteru came from there.  Of course this is when Antarctica was a continent of Plains and animals, not the harsh hell of snow and ice it is now. </p>

<p>When I think of these things, the hollow earth idea comes to me, but as much as I&#39;ve studied it, I simply cannot accept it due to absurdity. I want to believe but it&#39;s too much. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like your idea from the point of view of writing science fiction, or an epic Lovecraftian/Tolkienesque type of tale, but realistically I think reality, as strange as it can be, is much simpler. </p>

<p>When I was a kid, I used to imagine that alien ships/UFOs weren&#39;t actually aliens, because aliens would be much too smart to fuck up like that and get captured on video by some earth monkeys, so I figured they were humans from the future who were able to time travel into the past, but weren&#39;t quite sophisticated enough not to get caught.</p>

<p>Now I simply think that UFOs are actually just current military technology,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like it! Would a mass extinction coincide with the end of an ice age and massive flooding? Bare with me. If sea level were to rise significantly (~25 feet) over a short period. I can&#39;t help but think even in our current time, most of earth&#39;s population (living mostly at or near sea level) would be S.O.L. which lends itself to the &quot;Atlantian&quot; cities that fill our history as well as the &quot;great flood&quot; stories.  </p>
