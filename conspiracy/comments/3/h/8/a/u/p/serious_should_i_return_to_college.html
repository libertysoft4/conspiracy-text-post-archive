        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am going in to my Sophomore year of college in two weeks, and I am so torn over what to do...</p>

<p>My college (in Alabama) is over 600 miles from my home (In North Eastern Ohio), and I do not have any family near my school. I am concerned that if shit hits the fan, I will be stranded and on my own in a state far from my family...</p>

<p>I am primarily concerned over the &quot;doomsday&quot; events that are proposed for September 2015 such as the Shemitah, the US&#39; financial collapse, or other earth-changing events, and I would like to hear your opinions: is it worth me going back to school, or should I take a semester off and see what happens?</p>

<p>I frequent this sub a lot, and I have seen posts regarding &quot;something&quot; happening next month, and I would like some help or advice in deciding my next step...</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably not. Like was said in previous post; &quot;People always see &#39;evidence&#39; when they are really looking for something to find, no matter how watered down or unrealistic it is.&quot; </p>

<p>Even if something happens, you would probably not be who is affected by it. Even if you were, what will you do? You know? All you can do is wait until something happens and THEN react to it. Worrying about the future and what MIGHT happen would not serve you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There have been so many doomsday predictions made that have come and gone without so much of a single tremor, you can not let the predictions of a group dictate your life. If the World ends or the shit hits the fan, you will have to deal with it when it happens (or not if you die), so why worry so much that you let it control your course?</p>

<p>The more fear you bleed into it, the more power something like this has over you. The more power YOU give it.</p>

<p>The most likely outcome is that -nothing- will happen in September and people will just move onto the NEXT thing/year/month that everybody is supposed to die or something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People always see &#39;evidence&#39; when they are really looking for something to find, no matter how watered down or unrealistic it is. </p>

<p>IF there is a financial collapse in the United States, chances are the only people affected will be the rich and the big corporations; the bigger you are, the harder you fall sort of thing. You will probably not be all that affected by it, most likely. Especially if you have no money in the stocks or anything like that.</p>

<p>But look at 2012? All conspiracy forums all over the internet were ablaze with &#39;Doomsday December 21st 2012&#39; and that day passed, nothing happened unless.. PLOT TWIST! WE ARE ALL GHOSTS ALREADY DEAD BECAUSE IT WAS DOOMSDAY THEN! Dundundunnnnn! </p>

<p>But seriously, just chill and do not let the fear control you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not only that, but if it really bothers you that a collapse could happen and would separate you from your family you could learn survival skills and map reading. Learn to locate yourself and your family on a map and then learn the land navigation skills to get to them. Then you&#39;ll only need to either have enough non-perishables to got you home or a field guide that tells you what plants you can forage and eat. Become a survivalist. Make friends with the rednecks around your area and have them teach you. Learn to hunt if you don&#39;t know how. Learn primitive survival and make regular trips into the woods to practice and hone your skills. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont think anyone should tell you what to do. But I will offer you some advise to help you make a decision.
Consider the possibility that we are all playing a role in this game of life, and maybe whatever happens is where we are suppose to be. What ever decision you make, make sure that its on the path of love. I will quote Don Juan from Carlos Castaneda work:</p>

<p><em>&quot;Anything is one of a million paths. Therefore you must always keep in mind that a path is only a path; if you feel you should not follow it, you must not stay with it under any conditions. To have such clarity you must lead a disciplined life. Only then will you know that any path is only a path and there is no affront, to oneself or to others, in dropping it if that is what your heart tells you to do.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;But your decision to keep on the path or to leave it must be free of fear or ambition. I warn you. Look at every path closely and deliberately. Try it as many times as you think necessary.  All paths are the same: they lead nowhere. ... Does this path have a heart? If it does, the path is good; if it doesn&#39;t, it is of no use. Both paths lead nowhere; but one has a heart, the other doesn&#39;t. One makes for a joyful journey; as long as you follow it, you are one with it. The other will make you curse your life. One makes you strong; the other weakens you.&quot;</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stock market crash (if the patterns aren&#39;t coincidental) is not going to cause mass chaos right now, it hasn&#39;t in the past.

<p>It&#39;s good to be prepared (I did move some money into cash so I can buy on the cheap if a crash does occur), but don&#39;t derail your life due to shysters peddling fear!</p>

<p>Also, 600 miles isn&#39;t that far--instead of dropping out of school, keep your car gassed up and keep some water bottles in the back.</p>

<p>The last thing you want is to derail your life for something that&#39;s so uncertain. If you prepare a little, if something does happen, you&#39;ll feel better and be in better shape. Derail your whole life, and if it doesn&#39;t happen, you&#39;ve derailed your life. :(</p>

<p>Example from my youth: the year 2000 bug fears. I saved whisky and cigs and kept water in my car. Nothing happened, but at that point, the provisions were still usable and I only felt slightly foolish. If I&#39;d quit my job and fled to the mountains, I&#39;d never have heard the end of it from my family...not to mention talking around why I left my job in future job interviews, egad.</p>
