        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is gonna sound like a crazy man&#39;s rant (hypothesis) and I hope y&#39;all enjoy it; here goes.. Homo-Sapiens likely didn&#39;t originate on Earth. Have you ever tried staring at the sun? Have you ever gotten sick just from being outside? Have you ever thought maybe this just wasn&#39;t your home? I&#39;ve experience these things. Science suggests we share 98% of our DNA with chimpanzees.. I don&#39;t believe that. Someone PROVE that. How about all those various &quot;humanoid&quot;, &quot;hominid&quot;, or &quot;human-like&quot; creatures we have discovered? How much DNA do we share with them? How about it, Science? I&#39;m really interested in the relationship between say, Homo-Sapiens and Neaderthals. They were living together on this planet for millennia; until we drove them into the deep forests. You know them as &quot;giants&quot;. I honestly believe we are living in some kind of simulated envirorment. Don&#39;t you ever feel like your being watched? Don&#39;t you ever have a group of strange things happen that spark new understandings about this world, and what it is? Aliens? God? Other dimensional beings? Channeling? New age? The occult? The mysteries? There&#39;s other shit out there and the vast majority us seem content pretending &quot;it&quot; isn&#39;t there. Now here&#39;s the scary part; these other beings look at us the way we look at an ant or a pig. Most of us are nothing to them. In fact, they are farming us in some way; whether you perceive it as human politicians farming your taxes, your time and energy, or as an alien sucking out blood and or other fluids. THEYRE ALL HAPPENING. You just can&#39;t perceive certain things. If the spectrum of light was a football field, you could see for about 3 yards, from infrared to ultraviolet. Same narrow threshold when it comes to sound. The point is we are NOT the end all be all or the main show on Earth. We like to think we are. What happens when Joey down the street finds out he lives in a big cage? Or a simulation? I don&#39;t know.. Here&#39;s my (working) theory; the Earth IS flat. But the rest of the universe likely isn&#39;t. By flat, I mean not a sphere. We possibly could be on a very, very large planetoid like a terrestrial Jupiter, with thousands of &quot;Earths&quot; (farms). This also could be a complete simulation, like a matrix or a computer program. I know the &quot;aliens&quot; as the Builders. They built it. But are they aliens or are they...human? This to me is the biggest question, because it brings up the levels of human morality. Can we do this kind of thing to each other? I think so. However, for fun let&#39;s assume that &quot;aliens&quot; built the dome. Have you ever thought, maybe humanity is so into science and science fiction because we have already been to the stars...maybe we&#39;re even from them. Maybe humanity has an expansive culture throughout the galaxy and we&#39;re fighting a war with greys and reptilians and we on &quot;Earth&quot; happen to be &quot;prisoners of war&quot;. Just some thoughts. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Someone did. They sequenced the genomes of both species and that was the result.</p>

<p>We also share some compelling percentage of our DNA with house flies and frogs and venus fly traps and sharks and Velociraptors (though we probably won&#39;t get a good sample of Velociraptor DNA to figure out exactly how much).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m really interested in the relationship between say, Homo-Sapiens and Neaderthals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then you should probably try searching via Google&#39;s science interface instead of ranting on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. We know that pretty closely, too.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the Google Scholar link: <a href="https://scholar.google.com/">https://scholar.google.com/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Don&#39;t you ever feel like your being watched?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Only when I&#39;m using a computer or mobile phone or go somewhere that I know or suspect has security cameras. Then again, I&#39;ve never been diagnosed with Paranoia so I have that going for me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Don&#39;t you ever have a group of strange things happen that spark new understandings about this world, and what it is?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well it wasn&#39;t all that strange to me, but these things that others probably find weird called &quot;education&quot; and &quot;reading&quot; definitely sparked my understanding of the universe.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...as an alien sucking out blood and or other fluids...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mosquitoes are aliens? Damn glad I smack all them bitches to death on sight then!</p>

<p>Seems like an awful lot of work to get here from... wherever &quot;there&quot; is... just to suck my blood. All that time, effort, engineering... you&#39;d think they could replicate human blood more easily than getting here. Hell, we can almost replicate human blood in the lab now and we&#39;re nowhere close to being able to send any appreciable number of living beings to another star system, right?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the Earth IS flat</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m shocked. SHOCKED. Oh. Wait. No, I&#39;m not.</p>

<p>Should be easy enough to prove though. Get the weakest Infrared telescope, drag it to Traverse City, Michigan on a dry, winter day, and take a picture of Chicago with it. If you can do that, you&#39;ll have proved that the earth&#39;s curvature is not what science says it is and either collect a Nobel prize or be killed by our mosquito alien overlords for exposing their plot... one or the other.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have you ever thought, maybe humanity is so into science and science fiction because we have already been to the stars</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not really. We&#39;re into science because we&#39;re curious and science fiction because we have imaginations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Maybe humanity has an expansive culture throughout the galaxy and we&#39;re fighting a war with greys and reptilians and we on &quot;Earth&quot; happen to be &quot;prisoners of war&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This perspective often seems to be spewed by people who have no concept of the planet&#39;s or the species&#39; history beyond their own lifetimes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bravo. Bravo. I have to say this may be the most deliciously sarcastic, pseudo-scientific rebuttal to any of my thoughts. And they are just thoughts, no need to feel like I&#39;m trying to convince you of anything. I choose reddit, these days, as an outlet for my &quot;absurb mosquito alien theories&quot; because of discussions like this. They challenge me. However, dear friend your not as challenging as you would like to believe. Give me the names of these &quot;someone&#39;s&quot; who &quot;sequenced our DNA&quot;. I am deeply offended by your last jab, I love history more than anything and could run circles around you in that domain. Science, maybe another story; so I&#39;m willing to discuss it.

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough. Your just like the others. Smart, driven, watchful, skeptical.. Yet; cold, and unwilling to open your mind. &quot;I know best, the things I care about and research MUST be important, even more important that other&#39;s research.&quot; When you make up you mind you make up your mind. When you ALWAYS have an open mind, when you NEVER make assumptions; when you ALWAYS try your best, Thats when the true enlightening answers will come. Fact and fiction are certainly subjective things, so your analysis is quite off base. Look more into your precious globular earth, hello-centric reality... There&#39;s a paradigm shift coming. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, evidence. I don&#39;t have any &quot;evidence&quot; for you today on my one day to relax and care not about the things of the world (I still care). There are some things you can&#39;t see, can&#39;t touch, can&#39;t perceive. You just feel them. Almost like they&#39;re simply...possible. What&#39;s the difference between probability and possibility? Not a lot. If your gonna take anything with you, if I have to give this a tldr; its that ANYTHING is possible.

<p>We invent tools so we can perceive them. Science is cool.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You just feel them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the realm of imagination, which is not evidence. I can imagine a lot of shit. A lot of really weird, really interesting, fun, dangerous, compelling, and entertaining shit.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s all imagination.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What&#39;s the difference between probability and possibility?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Probability is the way we measure possibility. Some things are impossible. For example, me single-handedly and without tools lifting the building I&#39;m sitting in off its foundation.</p>

<p>A better question is: does the fact that we can <em>imagine</em> something make that thing necessarily <em>possible</em>? (Spoiler: No)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>its that ANYTHING is possible</p>

<p>Newp. And anyone who actually believes that either has an incredibly weak imagination or an incredibly weak understanding of the universe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you enjoy the insulting aspect of this? Keep in mind that your just one ant on a pale blue dot in the middle of an endless expanse of gaseous chaos. At least, that&#39;s what you think. I don&#39;t disagree with your stance on probalitlty and for obvious reasons that WOULD be the official understanding of it, wouldn&#39;t it? Can&#39;t have regular joes going around thinking they could uplift themselves could we? That&#39;d be terribly bad for business. When I say anything is possible, I&#39;m referring to the multi-verse theory.

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry I realize that may have come of as an incendiary comment: mostly referring to the first part of your rant about how you were asking for proof about the relationship between the great apes and humans. I made that comment while only reading half of your post before finishing. And that was unfair. </p>

<p>But, as someone who works in a biological field, I can assure you that it has been confirmed multiple times by genetic sequencing that we humans, as far as we understand the genetic code, are not exceptional to this planet. </p>

<p>The fact that nearly 100% of all life share the same mechanism known as &quot;The Central Dogma&quot; of biology, and it all uses roughly the same code and same material (nucleotides) parsimony tells us it&#39;s more likely everything evolved from a single primordial life form. Whether there were others in the soup, they may have been out competed and we&#39;re stuck with how biology works on this planet. </p>

<p>Now whether the way life works is unique to earth, that&#39;s a different story. Our origins may have come from a place far, far away. Not as humans, but at least the recipe to creat earth-like life carried on a celestial body that seeded this rock. Check out &quot;panspermia&quot; and the field of astrobiology as a whole. </p>

<p>Now whether we are on an installation, something like an inverse Halo station, being harvested by ETs or whatever... a bit of a stretch. But hey, maybe, I&#39;ve never been to space. I really doubt it because I&#39;m comfortable with a null hypothesis in my day to day life. </p>

Apperently earth is about 4.6 billion years old; that leaves a lot of time for...drama. Have you witnessed the remains of humans being found that pre-date evolution theory? They have found homo-sapien skeletons that are hundreds of thousands of years older than previously thought; bashing any theory of us coming FROM Neanderthals. I suspect there is another being; we&#39;ll call it X. Neanderthals, Homo-Erectus, Hom-Sapien, etc all come FROM X; another source. He are hybrids of IT. That is my theory. </p>

<p>Do you have an estimate?</p>

<p>Sure, current estimates of the first single-cell organism is placed at roughly 1bn years after the formation of earth. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>they found <em>Homo sapiens</em> skeletons that are hundreds of thousands of years older than previously thought. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know and isn&#39;t it exciting? The fossil record is, and always will be, incomplete. I&#39;m in the minority and like to think the human species of same anatomical structure existed before the current estimate. It opens the door to many of the mysteries surrounding the ancient world and newly discovered ancient civilizations (looking at you, Göbekli Tepe)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>bashing any theory of us coming FROM Neanderthals </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That theory is new to me... considering there is considerable evidence that Neanderthals and humans coexisted. Can&#39;t come from something that was extant in the same time period. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>that is my theory </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, what you described is called a MRCA (most recent common ancestor). Every species on the planet shares one, it&#39;s relative to how you compare the phylogeny. &quot;X&quot; doesn&#39;t <em>really</em> exist. Rather, gradual changes punctuated by periodic catastrophes change the genome of a population and over time, the genome will differ from a parent population. This will likely lead to an incompatibility between mating, resulting in sterile offspring, and whaddya know... speciation has occurred. That, my friend, is evolution. It&#39;s not really a theory, it&#39;s nature.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We sure are. In its essence, evolution is just change over time. As long as the human genome is experiencing random mutations, we are still evolving as a species.</p>

<p>In a more philosophical look, there really is no <em>time</em>. There&#39;s just one moment in the cosmos. We use time in a sense to demarcate changes in the cosmos - and perceive it only linearly. And in that linear progression of change, we are all susceptible to its current. </p>

<p>Edit: to add, not just experience random mutations, but having those mutations &quot;fixed&quot; to the genome as they are passed down to offspring and not selected out by a &quot;selection pressure&quot; if the change is detrimental to the species survivability. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm, I see what you&#39;re getting out. It&#39;s not really a correct way of thinking, but I do see what you&#39;re getting at. If you&#39;re under the assumption that evolution has a certain goal or objective to change an organism into something &quot;better&quot;, that&#39;s not the case. Again, evolution is just change. And with that change comes more intricacies and complexities to a lineage or &quot;clade&quot;. <em>De-evolution</em> in that sense would be, I guess, changing back into a more rudimentary form (think of a sessile organism, like a filter-feeder). </p>

<p>Some think technology is stifling our evolution. While I agree, technology can make us lazy, it also has tremendous ramifications for good. And also evil. The two entities are co-evolving. We are, after all, the sex organs of the machine world. Maybe we&#39;ll approach the singularity of man and machine and that will be the ultimate fate of the human evolution. </p>

<p>And you might want to go back further. Agriculture is buy and large the catalyst to where we are today. Humans are more hunter-gatherers naturally. But then again, since everything is a product of the universe, there really is no &quot;natural&quot;. It&#39;s more of an artificial term to differentiate between man-made entities and non-man-made entities. </p>

<p>The earth will be fine. Nature will be fine. We are the ones who will/will not be fine depending on our actions. </p>
