    <div class="md"><p>Wow. So the guy on the billboard his &quot;friends&quot; put up is part of the company that <em>owns</em> the &quot;fake website&quot; &quot;making fun&quot; of him.</p>

<p>I thought it was odd when the name &quot;Coors&quot; was so clearly visible in the thumbnail about a &quot;joke&quot; billboard. Why am I seeing a case of beer? Shouldn&#39;t I be seeing a billboard? Originally I didn&#39;t feel like clicking it to see what the rest was about, it was just too off-putting (though I have looked now). Think I was split between the possibilities of &quot;ad&quot; and &quot;lame OP&quot;, though, but didn&#39;t really think about it hard enough for the thoughts to solidify - it was just another thing out of many I would ignore.</p>

<p>Though now I guess what happened is they did some testing to make sure the thumbnail would show up like that before posting, so that even people who didn&#39;t click would be able to read the brand name.</p>

<p>Hm... <a href="/u/spez">/u/spez</a>, <a href="/u/kn0thing">/u/kn0thing</a>, doesn&#39;t guerrilla marketing go against reddit policy or something? Aren&#39;t you losing out on advertising dollars when companies place advertisements surreptitiously like that instead of paying for them? I think what people have posted in this thread should be sufficient evidence to act on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A name on the billboard is blurred out in the billboard photo, though it looks like it could easily be ruboutthebumps.com</p>

<p>I&#39;ll concede it could instead be about his firm, but marketing his firm and not the beer is still marketing. Though he could be doing either or both.</p>

<p>And what are you talking about? Did I misuse the term &quot;guerrilla&quot;? Spam is spam. Sometimes it&#39;s blatant and you can just hit ban, and sometimes it&#39;s less obvious and you need actual evidence before banning someone (or whatever the admins want to do). I thought they might like to know about this, so I pinged a couple of them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I work in marketing, and I don&#39;t think this is a marketing attempt - although this could be a great example of guerilla marketing. This is why it&#39;s not a marketing attempt:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The case of beer in the first pic is wrinkly. No way they&#39;d let their beer case get wrinkled and busted up in a pic. It&#39;s gotta look pristine, perfect, flawless. </p></li>
<li><p>Second photo is half of a beer label. Whoever is marketing beer in this pic is doing a terrible job at it. These projects cost money, so you don&#39;t waste it on half a beer label toward the audience. </p></li>
<li><p>The address is the fellows home address on the WHOIS. It is not the person&#39;s work address for the company.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, I just looked up the Sixth City Marketing guys. They are an SEO and PPC agency, and they&#39;re not huge. They&#39;re rather small. I highly doubt a massive beer company would trust them with a project like this. You hire people who can effectively, covertly market to individuals. </p></li>
<li><p>The likely explanation is this guy happens to work in marketing, so probably has the connections for billboards, etc, because he works at this digital marketing firm. He just got creative with the industry that he works in to make a memorable night. Doesn&#39;t seem out of the ordinary. </p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>For sure. You are correct. I could be absolutely wrong. But I think the nail in the coffin is the fact that you are not required to fill out a WHOIS. </p>

<p>You are allowed to make that anonymous. </p>

<p>So if these digital marketing guys who should know all about this. didn&#39;t know how to maintain an anonymous WHOIS registration - then they really made a big mistake by outing themselves. </p>

<p>I was looking at this hours ago and I for one would not find something like that funny at all. Not even a little, not to mention it went super far to be even slightly normal. It went to creepy to be a prank.</p>

<p>However, given that this is a common reaction to this type of image/post, what does that say about the environment we live in? This is a strange time to be alive. I can&#39;t tell if we are all aware or apathetic to this garbage corporate landscape where nothing is genuine anymore. Hyper-reality is here folks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, [removed] means that the mods removed the post. When a mod removes a self post it erases what you wrote in the text box, even when people look through your posting history (dunno why it does that). If he&#39;d removed it it wouldn&#39;t show up in his post history at all, not even the title, it&#39;d just be gone. Being as the mods removed it and not him, I&#39;m wondering if he&#39;d humour us with mentioning what it said.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tried looking into what you are asking and I&#39;m stumped as to why the content doesn&#39;t show up under the post unless I&#39;m logged in. Maybe I&#39;m reddit-stupid, I don&#39;t know.<br/>
But the post was a huge rant about evidence for a much different human history and timeline and how it should be questioned about more often than it is and that the biggest conspiracy of all time is why would this information/evidence be silenced and ignored? </p>

<p>Thanks for having a discussion and not a yelling match. </p>
