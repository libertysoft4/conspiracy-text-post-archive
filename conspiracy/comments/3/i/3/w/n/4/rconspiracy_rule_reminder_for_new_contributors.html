In general it is easier to create false parallels between two groups than to refute evidence and actually debunk things; a good example is the Oathkeeper wikipedia entry that claims they are a neo-Nazi group.  It&#39;s ludicrous, of course, but people are easily led into making that association and so it stands.</p>

<p>In my experience, it&#39;s precisely Zionist Jews making these sort of false correlations and straw man arguments. When truthers want to convince someone that Jews were involved in 9/11, they tend to just show them the evidence that Jews were involved in 9/11.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think anybody here genuinely believes all living Jews were involved in the 9/11 attacks, if that&#39;s what you&#39;re suggesting. If you&#39;re Jewish and weren&#39;t involved, then I can see why you&#39;d have a problem with other people saying &quot;Jews did 9/11&quot;, but at the end of the day, they did do 9/11, so I think the truth far outweighs any offence you might take from the way it is worded.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes, it is predominantly the evidence of Mossad&#39;s involvement which has created the phrase. That said, there is also quite a bit of evidence against Zionists in America, as the links above will show.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but they are a very secretive organization and I doubt they would let anything leak if there was anything to leak.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They certainly would not admit it unless they were left with no alternative, I agree.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Israel is a big place, and not everyone there will have wanted these attacks to happen, or even known that internal elements were involved. There is also the very legitimate possibility that they simply wanted to cover their own tracks. Consider that even in America, there is much evidence that the FBI tried to warn of the attacks, and could have quite easily prevented them, but they were unable to because of the actions of their own government -- particularly in its six refusals to give them a warrant to search the hard drive of Zacarias Moussaoui.</p>

<p>The explosives residue discovered on the Mossad agents, and the bomb which went off at George Washington bridge both imply a lot more than &quot;foreknowledge&quot;. They imply direct involvement.</p>

<p>Credibility is a subjective and -- in this instance -- inadequate hiding place. Either the information is correct, or it is not. What you are basically telling me is that you are not prepared to find out.</p>

<p>I agree that more than one source would be better, but for someone apparently concerned with &quot;credibility&quot;, even you must concede that the American FBI is a highly credible source, which is where this information has come from. The first part at least, about the Mossad agents testing positive for explosives residue. The third link I posted is a transcript of the FBI file on their arrest, which was recently declassified.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Fair enough. You would be right to be wary of propaganda on the internet, but I believe this article is far too detailed and specific to be considered such. It gives precise names and precise information. Propaganda tends to be a lot more cloudy, vague and is unmistakably emotive.</p>

<p>No, it&#39;s actually the opposite of ludicrous. What is ludicrous is the notion that you think you can make up your own facts about what other people think.</p>

<p>Oh, I see. You&#39;re just here to say stupid stuff. Cool.</p>

<p>I can think of many statistics that would seemingly blow your toleration to dust. For example. Keeping it local to the US, 264 million people out of 318 million people all believe in Christianity.</p>

<p>And just what do you think the chances are that all of the users posting on this site at any given moment will fall into just one of those groups (i.e. either all Christians or all non-Christians)?</p>

<p>It appears you struggle to understand even basic logic, otherwise it is certain you would understand why your example proves the very point you are trying to refute. If only 2 out of every 3 people are Christians, then it doesn&#39;t take a mathematical genius to figure out that not everybody is going to be Christian on a forum with 300,000+ people.</p>

<p>Just lol.</p>

<p>If you are in the &quot;non-conspiracy community&quot; then it is because you do not believe in conspiracies. Hence, it cannot then be incorrect to say you don&#39;t believe in conspiracies. Calling someone a dupe for this belief is completely in line with the facts. You have admitted the belief and the belief is demonstrably wrong. Conspiracies can and do happen. </p>

<p>I wonder if some of you even think before you speak.</p>

<p>Clearly, I am not, so stop being fucking ridiculous. The one and only thing which could possibly qualify someone as being in the &quot;non-conspiracist community&quot; as you put it, is that they don&#39;t believe in conspiracies. The OP was discussing taking a belief which is <em>not</em> homogenous among a group, and then using it as a blanket argument to discredit the entire group. This is obviously something quite different and your attempt to fallaciously merge the two concepts simply betrays your own dishonesty.</p>

<p>A user is trying to gain support of other users and mods by stickying a very important Richard Gage C-SPAN interview for the month of September:</p>

<p>I&#39;m not here trying to fuck with the mods. I&#39;m here trying to get an apology (in the form of a serious dedication for a sticky of the REAL Richard Gage explaining what the fake ama did not) for last year&#39;s debacle of a 911 anniversary.</p>

<p><a href="/u/dishonestcartooNIST">/u/dishonestcartooNIST</a> is the user who came up with the idea for the Richard Gage sticky, since axolotl made the &#39;mistake,&#39; there should be some sort of &#39;kith and make up&#39; sort of thing, and what better way than during the this year&#39;s anniversary?</p>

<p>Cheers brother. We are in this together. Truth will prevail</p>

<p>That is all. Please don&#39;t take this as an insult to mods. </p>

<p>Edit: so if you and axolotl support it, we just need 3 other mods. You&#39;re a mod of <a href="/r/911truth">/r/911truth</a>, so you should be able to help out with your extensive knowledge of Richard&#39;s work and 911 truth!!!</p>

<p>Actually that&#39;s your 2nd most common contribution.</p>

<p>I would vote for an AMA with the real Richard Gage.  But since Mr.Gage has apparently been contacted by a certain group of users here and he has claimed that he will never do an AMA here then I guess that&#39;s out of the question.</p>

<p>Honestly Gage has created an atmosphere that is toxic for independent thought and only rewards people who parrot his exact words.  If you&#39;re not an architect or engineer then your opinion doesn&#39;t matter.</p>

<p>That all being said if the real Mr Gage would please stand up and do an AMA then I would vote for it, unfortunately I don&#39;t think Gage does speaking events if he doesn&#39;t get paid for it so I doubt that will happen.</p>

<p>Oh no you don&#39;t. Both you and controlled-demo-wtc (same person?) have been antagonizing some of the mods here ever since your new accounts were created after being previously banned for personal attacks. Sure, you post some decent stuff but your behavior always makes it seem like you&#39;re intentionally torpedoing  <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and the 9/11 Truth movement to boot.</p>

<p>This is your last warning. Knock off the personal attacks on users and mods or you&#39;re gone again. And if that happens, any more new accounts you create will also be banned on sight. And believe me, your tactics are very recognizable.</p>

<p>Edit: It would not surprise me in the least if you two (one?) <em>were</em> the fake Richard Gage and planned this whole scenario all along.</p>

<p>Hey guys, Sorry about the tone. I&#39;m as aggressive as some of you. I know that&#39;s off putting, but shit don&#39;t get done unless people push for change. I see no one else trying to highlight the issue. Bull by the horns guys. This is the anniversary of the greatest OP the USA shadow government has ever pulled off. Problem is they forgot about Newton&#39;s laws of motion.</p>

<p>How about 4 stickies (1 per week, all 4 weeks of September) all pertaining to the controlled demolitions of the three towers?
A physics lesson with David Chandler (can be a youtube w/o the ae911truth logo on it, just because)</p>

<p>A link to the New Pearl Harbor video with discussion. I am not affiliated with anyone or organization. Just need to make that clear for some.</p>

<p>A look at exploding debris with David Chandler (once again, non ae911truth related)</p>

<p>And maybe a general discussion on the last week pertaining to the general direction we&#39;ve taken as a result of 9.11.01, which includes links to the first 3 weeks&#39; discussions.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a suggestion all mods are welcome to think about.</p>

<p>Would you please stop these phony &quot;gottcha&quot; posts?  Nobody is impressed.</p>

<p>Lete spell it out to you, there is a lot more to this community than AE911TRUTH.org, we don&#39;t adopt official positions on conspiracy theories. </p>

<p>Ae911truth is equally welcome here as Judy Woods or flat earth.  This is a generic conspiracy theory sub.  Each of the mods are individuals who are welcome to hold whatever opinions they wish and we do so regularly.</p>

<p>Every time something is posted or stickied that isn&#39;t ae911truth, it isn&#39;t the end of the world.  As a matter of fact I was invited to mod the 911 centric subs and I declined because its not really my thing.  So as hard as this is going to be for you to believe, I&#39;m really not here to sabotage the ae911truth movement but because of their intolerance for outsiders they have chose to repeatedly sabotage me as well as other mods here.</p>

<p>So when your suggestions about ae911truth stickies aren&#39;t received with enthusiastic jubilation perhaps you should reflect on your past behavior towards the mods here instead of doubling down on more of the same behavior!</p>

<p>This sounds a lot like you want the entire month of September to be a Richard Gage festival.  Not going to happen.  There are dozens of 9-11 theories and they are all equally welcome here.  And some people don&#39;t even want to talk about 9-11 so they talk about other things.  I think 30 days of anything is a stupid idea, one that isn&#39;t going to happen.</p>

<p>You just made a claim about being attacked personally by ae911truth advocates and yet you show no proof. </p>

<p>Majority opinion about what? You have to be specific. After you&#39;ve stated specifically what you&#39;re referring to, then provide us with evidence which confirms your belief that this is the majority opinion. What analysis have you done? If you can properly evidence your claim, then I don&#39;t think anybody will have a problem.</p>

<p>But of course the OP isn&#39;t simply talking about wonky -- but innocent -- assumptions about &quot;majority opinion&quot;. He&#39;s talking about deliberate false syllogisms where you might say:-</p>

<p>Subject A believes this.</p>

<p>Subject A is part of group X.</p>

But I <em>will</em> express my disagreement for theories I think are either unfounded and ridiculous and/or thinly veiled racism. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3cbkgp/if_youre_still_in_denial_about_stormfront/">I have proven, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that Stormfront <em>does</em> brigade this subreddit.</a> I don&#39;t think their obviously racist posts should be removed, but that&#39;s absolutely not the same thing as saying &quot;no crying about content&quot;. That&#39;s just another way of saying &quot;no passionately disagreeing with posts&quot;, which is absurd.</p>

<p>I know the Duke thread being referred to, and I admit the one guy in there was being a bit immature and hard-headed. But such a blanket statement of &quot;no crying&quot; is again, condescending to say the very least. </p>

    <div class="md"><ul>
<li><p>I think JFK was likely killed by the CIA, which implicates those in power in the CIA at the time: Namely, then-future-, now-former- president George HW Bush. Which brings about greater suspicion of his sons. </p></li>
<li><p>I think that a global and near-ubiquitous banking cartel has manipulated the powers of government in almost every country on the planet towards the ends of keeping their own power. I think this bit of conspiracy has been on-going for over two centuries. </p></li>
<li><p>I think 9/11 was not a false-flag operation, nor an operation condoned by &#39;the US government&#39;. That being said, I believe that a certain group within the government (neo-cons and the military industrial complex) knew it was being planned - at the very least - and did nothing, or at worst, facilitated the planning and execution of the event, in order to draw the US into a &quot;war on terror&quot;. Subtle difference between a false flag and this - a <em>government</em> commits a false flag. This wasn&#39;t done by &#39;the government&#39;, it was done by a corrupt group <em>within</em> the government, and I recognize the difference. </p>

<p>This was done to create the demand for weapons and weapons technology, creating a new arms race. The difference though, is that this arms race is against a bogeyman who, while I don&#39;t deny the existence of, is very much inflated. I&#39;m speaking of course of Terrorism. I think that many, but not all, terrorist attacks are encouraged by certain pockets of the government in collusion with keeping the war on terror going. Note: This does not include the &#39;staging&#39; of terrorist attacks. While I don&#39;t discount that it could happen, I also haven&#39;t seen any evidence to the affect that I consider conclusive, so I reserve my judgement.</p></li>
<li><p>I have my suspicions regarding Edward Snowden. He was covered by the media far too well for it to be anything but condoned by the government in a big way. If the mass media can be convinced to keep quiet about JFK and TPP decades apart, they&#39;d be told to shut up about Snowden if they were at all worried about what was being done. They aren&#39;t. Further, Snowden is a liar and no better than Bradley, in my eyes: He claims to have read the documents prior to handing them off, but when questioned point blank, he dodged the question. It happened on John Oliver&#39;s show. The guy wasn&#39;t just a data-analyst, he was a counter-intelligence trainer: He <em>taught classes</em> on being a convincing liar. He had a very long history with various intelligence agencies. I think he should be arrested as a traitor and convicted as one too, however keep in mind: He was a civilian, not military. Therefor, his punishment would almost certainly be less than that of Bradley/Chelsea Manning.</p></li>

<p>Shall I continue? I could. </p>

<p>Edit - Watch how this works: let&#39;s pretend that the rule against calling someone a shill was removed. Anyone can call someone a shill now.</p>

<p>Well what&#39;s the point of a shill? To derail discussion. It&#39;s not to <em>guide</em> discussion, not here - it&#39;s to derail it entirely. To make <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> look bad. Right? Well there&#39;s no faster way to derail discussion of a topic than to call someone presenting a cogent argument, a shill. </p>

<p>Therefor, a shill would argue that calling someone a shill here should be allowed, as that would be their easiest-to-use tool to derail any given discussion.</p>

<p>Therefor, I could argue that <a href="/u/TheCocaineFairy">/u/TheCocaineFairy</a> (and you) <em>are</em> obvious shills, because shills want to be able to call people shills, as it would serve their purposes easier than real arguments. </p>

<p>This is why it&#39;s useless to call someone a shill, unless your goal is actually to derail the conversation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Me and you both know that you can distinguish the difference between a normal person and a shill just by looking at their history. If the account was made that day and they are constantly arguing about the same thing then they are most likely a shill. Example: there was a poster saying that holocaust revisionism was bullshit and we should just blindly accept the official story because 6 million. I lurked them and noticed that the only thing they would post was defending the official story of the holocaust. Also, if someone is going to preach the wonders of GMOs and tell me how I should drink monsanto&#39;s glyphosate because its safe, well then they are a shill by default, or a troll. </p>

<p>It isn&#39;t useful because it can&#39;t be evidenced. 99.9% of those called a &#39;shill&#39; are just... called a shill, there&#39;s no evidence for them <em>being</em> shills.

<p>So, I feel that because of that, it shouldn&#39;t be a problem. <strong>Free thinking</strong> should include a user&#39;s thoughts, feelings, and observations about other users in here as well. </p>

<p>I shouldn&#39;t have to explain and give all my proof for why I think a certain user is a shill, every single time I want to make other users aware of that user acting shilly.

<p>These shilly people who hang out here basically state that conspiracy theorists are the types of people who would go to their houses after certain discussions because of how crazy and irrational they are, but in actuality I feel that it&#39;s the opposite, they are truly the aggressive ones.</p>

A &quot;shill&quot; to you is just someone who argues against you with arguments you can&#39;t address properly, so you insult them with some name with a made-up definition of your own. </p>

<p>Actually, I was trying to tell you <em>what a shill is</em>. What you think of the definition means nothing. My subjective opinion on the definition of the color blue doesn&#39;t change the actual color of the sky. There is an objective definition of &#39;shill&#39;, and it heavily implies compensation in one form or another. I cannot think of a single time when it wouldn&#39;t. </p>

<p>Good day to you as well bud.</p>

<p>How can you prove that a particular user stands to benefit? We&#39;ll use me as an example: I&#39;ve been called a shill for Nestle. Something fierce. All because I defended the use of baby formula for mothers who need to supplement their breast milk. In that thread I was called a shill no less than a dozen times by as many users. </p>

<p>How could someone evidence that I stood to gain from Nestle&#39;s &#39;good&#39; reputation? I mean really: What could they point to? Nothing but my personal financial statements. Information that isn&#39;t available on the internet. Hardcore doxxing, enough to be IP-banned from reddit entirely. </p>

<p>Use any other instance you like: How can someone show this &#39;shilly behavior&#39;? I&#39;m not even arguing shills don&#39;t exist – they absolutely do – but even I can&#39;t figure how I might go about <em>proving</em> a specific user <em>is a shill</em> while staying within the confines of the rules of this sub and of reddit at large.</p>

<p>Glad to hear someone of authority hear say this. Shill accusations are rampant here, and they serve to shut down conversation immediately. That said,I&#39;ve noticed that enforcement of this rule seems better lately.</p>

<p>One thing I have noticed however is that regular and long term users of this sub seem to be exempt from this rule. There are a number of users (won&#39;t name anyone specific, but you can go to any vaccine or 911 related thread to see it) who make it a habit to call about anyone who disagrees with them a shill and never seem to have any warnings levelled against them, despite being reported.</p>

<p>Are prominent users being protected by mods? Do you stand by this differential treatment? </p>

<p>Glad you don&#39;t think so, but a cursory glance at populated threads of the topics I mentioned there are recognizable users habitually engaging in this behaviour. In fact, I can think of one occasion where a mod expressed admiration for another user&#39;s comment in which they called me a shill. </p>

<p>I actually am not pursuing banning of any users. As this issue if largely related to promoting mature discussion, I would argue a public warning from moderators explaining why accusations are against the rules (it&#39;s dishonest and unfalsifiable) would be far more productive. It can be a standard copy-paste, and I think public displays of the rule being enforced would go a long way to changing the culture here.</p>

<p>Sometimes. I&#39;ve had one user (since shadowbanned) stalk me across multiple threads in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, calling me a Jewish shill and hurling invective and just obvious abuse over the space three or four days. In between the posts, he was sending me bizarre PMs encouraging me to kill myself. These were reported to the admins.</p>

<p>Instead of engaging him, I asked him to stop and reported the posts. <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3if2nh/if_the_bubble_touches_me_youre_going_to_be/cug6cji">To this day, his posts remain</a> - this is just one example of about a half dozen other threads where he was doing the same thing. Because these posts were reported, this means they were looked at and approved by a moderator - which the mod log at the time clearly showed. I can&#39;t imagine the same leniency being afforded to me, a non-conspiracist, if I engaged in this way with a believer.</p>

<p>Anyway, the same mod log showed you tried to deal with the user with a ban, I&#39;m guessing you were either overruled or changed your mind. <a href="/u/SovereignMan">/u/SovereignMan</a> is also very fair at enforcing the rules against trolling here, if he&#39;s around he can be counted on to take the reports on their merits.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the other mods, from what I&#39;ve seen, are very patchy and may exhibit less neutrality when the &quot;victim&quot; of the trolling isn&#39;t a conspiracist. Either that or they just don&#39;t remove trolls, no matter how obvious, in any circumstance.</p>

<p>Just sayin&#39;.</p>

<p>As a new contributer here, I can&#39;t fully decipher if this is directed at me,  or something I may have posted,  and if it is,  I&#39;d like to ensure that I don&#39;t continue doing it,  and adhere to the rules here. </p>

<p>It would really help if the mods here would leave a few examples of posts that they saw that they weren&#39;t happy with and thought may have broken a rule.  If one of my posts is included,  I really won&#39;t be offended in the slightest.</p>
