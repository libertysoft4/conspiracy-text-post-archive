        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As an entertainment figure, I hate to get political, but for years I’ve become increasingly convinced of a global conspiracy. I’m being completely honest here, but after years of research and journaling and anguished thought, I’ve decided to start speaking out.</p>

<p>I don’t believe the 18th century actually happened.</p>

<p>I have come to realize that in the late 1600’s, the merchant princes and bankers were part of a secret society of ultra-wealthy conspirators who deeply resented their subservience to royalty and other institutions of the state, and they put together a daring plan to take over the world. It was the last time in history, before the explosion of science and communication technology, that there would be such a perfect confluence of printed media tightly controlled by big companies, widespread illiteracy, concentrated centers of education, draconian debtor laws, and extremely common premature death that they could wipe the slate clean on history, and educate a new generation of unquestioning children with the doctrine that it was suddenly the 1800’s.</p>

<p>I have come to the terrifying conclusion that all of the history from the years 1700 – 1800 was cobbled together by a secret society of highly ambitious, maniacal rich people. They controlled enough royal debt, all the printing presses, bought off an already hilariously corrupt church (installing a new Pope in the process, loyal to the bankers), ran the entire world through a brutal system of colonies, and ruled over a highly illiterate population which received any information from the big printing presses this secret society ultimately controlled.</p>

<p>Their objective was to create a nation ruled by businessmen. Through propaganda, threats, bribes, murder, and the tightly controlled printing of books, they convinced people in the year 1700 that it was actually the year 1800, that thirteen colonies of the British Empire, controlled primarily by wealthy bankers and landowners, had somehow won a war against the most terrifying military power on the globe and established a country where there were no kings, no popes, no caliphates, and no historical culture except the one they invented in the so-called history books they printed and delivered to schoolhouses across the globe.</p>

<p>I can’t put it any other way, my friends, but I’m willing to stand up and be the lone voice in a world controlled by the stifling influence of this relentless conspiracy. The 18th century did not happen! It was all a hoax. The men in charge of this conspiracy knew that they stood upon the precipice of a disaster. They knew that in only a few short years, there would be cameras and newspapers and telegraphs and phones and smaller, more affordable printing presses. They knew that questioning history would become impossible in only a few short decades. They knew that as lifespans increased, it would be more and more difficult to explain away the death of a 35 year old lawyer who refused to go along with their schemes. They knew the colonial system was on the verge of collapse, so they would be unable to force the native populations of the globe to modify their calendars. The enslavement of Africans couldn’t last much longer, so it was their last chance to dictate unto the helpless and the uneducated what year it really was!</p>

<p>So they burned a few barns, fired some muskets into a few neighborhoods, played a theater of war between a handful of a farmers and a few squadrons of Royal British marines who were all soon to be bribed off to paradises in the Indian colonies, and they rewrote history.
The divine right of kings was supplanted by the divine right of money, and now the colossus stands astride our globe! The glass towers of the secret kings of the Earth glitter in the sun, the shining, polluting, all-consuming legacy of wealth created by the most brilliant scam in history.</p>

<p>I will be writing more about this in the future. I am passionate about history, and passionate about the truth. I know that by posting this, my life will be in danger. I know that I may disappear at any moment because of these bold words, and when I do, you will know why! They won’t be able to tolerate my dissenting voice for long, but before they get me, I must cry out in the wilderness; I must cry out that we have been fooled and robbed of one hundred years of history by the maniacal money men of the past. These snakes, these merchant princes, bankers, and ultra-elite hucksters of modern history… they have corrupted history itself by completely splicing their existence into a timeline which is now poisoned.</p>

<p>People of Earth, I have hard words for you to hear. You must know the truth! And the TRUTH is that right now, it is the year 1915!</p>

<p>The truth shall set us free!</p>

<p>More on this to come, as I compile my research and bring this to light as best I am able, before I am silenced by Adam Smith’s “invisible hand”.</p>

<p>I will be posting updates here, and on my website at <a href="http://www.magnusvonblack.com">http://www.magnusvonblack.com</a>. Thank you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not even sure where to start with this, but I&#39;ll try to play the game for a bit...</p>

<p>How would you go about explaining all of the science and other such tech progression that happened in that period?  Roads built, buildings built, companies that came into existence and thrived, WORLD history outside of the worldwide colonies and europe.  A lot of shit happens in 100 years.</p>

<p>You only touched on a few things and there&#39;s already enormous holes.  Gonna have to tighten that theory up....a lot.</p>

<p>Did they pay off everyone in the world that thought it was 1700?  Just because people couldn&#39;t read doesn&#39;t mean they didn&#39;t know what year it was.  This type of undertaking wouldn&#39;t happen over night, either.  A lot of people were &quot;off the grid&quot; back then and still knew what year it was and how to read.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re looking for some kind of writing prompt, maybe just focus on the colonies. Then the twist or third act can be when they figure out that 100 years just disappeared into thin air.</p>

<p>No one knows exactly what the world looked like in 1699 vs 1800. Everything we know about the transition from the 17th century to the 19th century is told to us in books written by the same people who want us to believe the 18th century never happened. It&#39;s not the buildings and the technology that sprung up overnight, it was just the year, on paper. Then a political coup occurred in the US and a financial corporatist empire was born.</p>

<p><em>&quot;Did they pay off everyone in the world that thought it was 1700? Just because people couldn&#39;t read doesn&#39;t mean they didn&#39;t know what year it was. This type of undertaking wouldn&#39;t happen over night, either. A lot of people were &quot;off the grid&quot; back then and still knew what year it was and how to read.&quot;</em></p>

<p>In 1699, society was organized around religions and local governments, and local governments got their information from the monarchy. If the King said it was Tuesday when everyone knew it was Saturday, that meant it was Tuesday and you had to shut the hell up or get burned alive in a dungeon. So if the King (forced by the bankers) says it&#39;s the year 1800, and the bankers agree, and the lawyers go by what the bankers say, and everyone who disagrees dies of &quot;typhoid fever&quot;, and all the kids are educated from new textbooks about all the amazing things that happened in the 1700&#39;s, then boom! It&#39;s now the year 1800 and after two generations no one can even remember that it was a global royalist/banker conspiracy. Then, when some random person claims it&#39;s the year 1705 instead of 1805, he just looks like a lunatic who can&#39;t read.</p>

<p>Think of how Hitler convinced the Germans that the Jews caused all of their economic problems, and then think of how much greater control over printed media the Kings and Merchant Princes had in 1699. Hitler couldn&#39;t dream of that kind of power. This would have been relatively easy to pull off with the right kind of power behind it, and the massive colony operating quasi-governments that manged trade, agri-production, and the burgeoning industrial revolution had THE. PERFECT. blend of power and technology in 1699 to pull this off.</p>

<p>The pieces fit together way too perfectly for any serious person to persist in their faith-based belief in the existence of the 18th century. </p>

The English speaking world (Canada, US, UK) didn&#39;t switch until 1752... a year that never happened!

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m kind of on board with your thinking, but I can&#39;t go along with the idea that the 18th century just never existed.</p>

<p>Of course it did. But it probably did not exist in the way we were taught that it did. Historical revisionism is real, I have experienced in my own lifetime.</p>

<p>And the sense of linear time is not necessarily the way that people experience living, but that is the way it is expressed in writing history. Have you ever read Kurt Vonnegut&#39;s Slaughterhouse Five? It was real and semi-auto biographical, but Vonnegut relates the experiences of his life <em>in non linear terms</em>. Slaughter House Five was all over the map with Vonnegut&#39;s life; he is 20 years old in one place and the next thing you know he is 50 and on a different level of existence, then next sentence he is living in yet a different phase of his life.</p>

<p>Life is much more disjointed than we think. It comes in fits and starts. We remember some things clearly and forget others. People <em>do not</em> live a linear existence in linear time and I think this is the gist of your theory?</p>

<p>If so, I think you are right.</p>

<p>Yet if we go to outline what came before us in a historical civilization sense, there is really no other way to catalog it except along the concept of linear time. 1702 was followed by 1703. It&#39;s all about cataloging and indexing, not about experience and the unfolding of events.</p>

<p>So don&#39;t confuse the indexing with the experiencing. They are two different things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Supposedly, according to the &quot;history&quot; we&#39;ve been taught by the powers that be, there were a series of calendar adjustments throughout the 16th, 17th, &quot;18th&quot; and 19th centuries in which various nations converted from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar. Since the 18th century calendar adjustment never actually happened, the whole century could have been sold as a &quot;calendar adjustment&quot; to the Asian dynasties, and they would care very little for how the &quot;barbarians&quot; kept time.</p>

<p>No records survive of this change for an obvious reason, that being that the only class of people who would care are the merchant class, and the merchant class is precisely where the conspiracy originated! Anyone who got out of line and started complaining about calendar adjustments would, at the very least, have to worry about losing their livelihoods. This was in a period of time where that meant debtors prison, enslavement, and starvation for your family. The merchant princes weren&#39;t screwing around, and this conspiracy goes DEEP, my friend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you seen all of the business records of medium to small Chinese merchants from the supposed 18th century? Or have you just been TOLD that those records exist? If you find 5 examples of business records from this time period, ask yourself how difficult it would be to fabricate 5 pieces of paper.</p>

<p>The bottom line is, there is no definitive proof that the 18th century ever happened. It&#39;s clearly a small collection of circumstantial evidence bolstered by an outrageous and concerted top-down campaign of misinformation.</p>

<p>Ask yourself what you really know about 18th century history in China, and what book it came from, and who published that book. Dollars to donuts it was published by a big company owned by a bigger company run by a shadowy board of directors with direct financial lineage to the overlords of the false century.</p>

<p>While I think the reasoning and motives in the OP are circumspect, the general conclusion that we are not in the &#39;right time&#39; is self evident.</p>

<p>We create arbitrary time makers for convince, not because they are real. Clocks and calendars don&#39;t keep time, they arrange our thoughts linearly. Useful certainly, but not real outside of being an idea.</p>

<p>The calendar we use is acknowledged to be inaccurate. Spanish destroyed the Mayan culture which produced the most accurate &#39;time&#39; keeping system we know of. Thankfully there are satellites now which track the things the Mayans did. Woefully misused, but they exist.</p>

<p>The relevant point to be gleaned from the OP is that colonizers did a lot of horrible things that lead to the horrible state we exist in now. The &#39;year&#39; hardly matters in comparison.</p>

<p>I wrote &quot;GPS utilizes satellites&quot; which is true.</p>

<p>No, it works by battery. But if you want to use the GPS function on your phone then satellites will be required, even if your phone more than likely communicates with some ground based cell towers to speed up the process.</p>

<p>And considering I own a large telescope and have regularly observed these satellites passing overhead at the exact second they are supposed to someone is either wasting billions of dollars tricking me or your conspiracy is wrong.</p>

<p>Also, I have been using GPS since the early 90s and I would be much more impressed with their ability to create a handheld computer that could reliably calculate position to within a few meters and simulate the path of satellites in addition to disabling itself when they were not in the correct simulated position at a time when the GameBoy was considered state of the art portable tech all for the sake of maintaining a rather pointless conspiracy than I would be with a simpler working GPS receiver that simply displays data fed to it via satellite.</p>

<p>How come relatively small companies/even individuals, can build GPS receivers and devices? How come GPS works anywhere on earth?

How come there is a huge amount of documentation about GPS, satellites etc. How come there is no proof that GPS and/or satellites do not exist? What happened with the satellites sent into space? Is that just a hoax? Did they build functional satellites, sent them into space, and then just didn&#39;t use them to trick us?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I have a question, how do you account for astronomy in your hypothesis? Before the 18th century astronomy was very important to many European and Asian courts (generally for superstitious reasons such as astrology) but because of this there are many court records surviving which allow us to date astronomical events in the past which historians and astronomers checked with known times such as the time it would take a comet to reappear. How do you take into account all of these historians and scientists who have done this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just can&#39;t, in good conscious, take it on faith that the 18th century happened. I don&#39;t believe the old European power structures simply melted away, I don&#39;t believe King Louis XIV ruled France for 72 years in an age when the average life expectancy was like 35 years. I don&#39;t believe the French Revolution just magically happened after this supposed &quot;Sun King&quot; finally died. I don&#39;t believe thirteen disorganized agriculture slave colonies defeated the best military on Earth. I could go on and on! It&#39;s the most ludicrous historical farce of all time, but we just accept it. There is less evidence that the 1700&#39;s happened than there is for any other century. For crying out loud, we have more evidence of the Roman Empire than we have of the revolutionary war. </p>

<p>The monarchies of Europe never would have given up their hold on power, but they were outwitted by the bankers. Europe was torn apart by war in the 1600&#39;s. The bankers and finance kings stirred 100&#39;s of internecine conflicts throughout that century, so that by 1699, the monarchies were barely held together by the loans from these same merchant princes. This gave them the leverage to literally skip a century of history on paper and re-educate generations of children that the United States existed and where business could do whatever they want. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve decided to break my silence and start helping to educate people about this FARCE that we are forced to endure every single day we sit in our cubicles helping our tax-dodging overlords buy private islands in the Caribbean. </p>

<p>This is huge, and it goes all the way to the top. You&#39;ll see.</p>

<p>*I don&#39;t believe thirteen disorganized agriculture slave colonies defeated the best military on Earth. *</p>

<p>Those 13 colonies were incredibly rich for one, one reason being that Britain didn&#39;t tax them much/at all. After Britain protected those colonies over several wars and needed a bit of payment to help cover the wars, they revolted. So they weren&#39;t just some &quot;slave colonies&quot;.</p>

<p>The Thirteen Colonies COULD NOT have won without the massive amount of French, Spanish and Dutch help they received. Help that pretty much bankrupt France. Those 13 colonies nearly lost a handful of times. THE THIRTEEN COLONIES WERE NOT ON THEIR OWN. They couldn&#39;t have won on their own.</p>

<p>Britain then went on to colonise India and many other places, maintaining it&#39;s global hegemony for more than 200 years. The British Empire is the largest of all time and reached it&#39;s peak size in the early 1920&#39;s. </p>
