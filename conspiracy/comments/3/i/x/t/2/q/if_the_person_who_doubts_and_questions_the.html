    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Truther&quot;, the media name given for members of the 9/11 truth movement, was meant as derogatory, and was conceived of about the same time as &quot;birther&quot;, the term given to people questioning BO&#39;s birth cert.

<p>It looks like the word truther (or 9/11 truther) was first coined in 2004, accordingly to a recent column by the journalist and critic Leslie Savan:
The term truther appears to be self-chosen. Jon Gold, an activist in the 9/11 Truth movement, wrote on his blog recently that the term originated in late 2004 when he was bucking up a fellow activist who “was tired of being ridiculed,” telling him, “You’re a 9/11 truther, don’t let them get to you.” Gold added, “In the back of my mind, I thought of the term ‘Quaker.’”

<hr/>

<p>I poked around a bit and found this.  </p>

<p>In response to a 2006 public opinion poll showing <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060616000251/http://news.yahoo.com/s/prweb/20060522/bs_prweb/prweb388743_4">70 million adults</a> called for a new 9/11 investigation, George Washington&#39;s blog called it <a href="http://georgewashington.blogspot.com/2006/05/social-proof.html">&quot;social proof&quot;</a> and used the word &quot;truther&quot;.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Therefore, virtually every press release or statement about 9/11 should include a reference to the poll to show people that many Americans are 9/11 truthers who scoff at the 9/11 Commission as a fraud and that demand a real 9/11 investigation.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. The term &#39;truther&#39; arose after people subscribing to a sizeable number of alternative and mutually exclusive conspiracy theories other than the official one used the worth &quot;truth&quot; so much and made the claim that they were in the sole possession of the truth rather than others, that it became a convenient way for people debunking their claims to refer to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe some &#39;truthers&#39; have asserted that they were in sole possession of the truth, but that is a much more common characteristic of the official cover up story defenders, whom I do refer to as &quot;liars&quot; since they are supporting a lie. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t see truthers as the sole possessors of the truth, so much as the people who are actively seeking it, so it is an unfair assertion to make about them. Something we have come to expect from our opposition. The liars are obviously trying to cover up the truth, making them our opposites on the issue. </p>

<p>Truthers can and do disagree and have heated arguments over those disagreements. That does not make them liars, only the people defending the official cover up stories deserve that label. </p>

<p>In any case I&#39;m all for a new investigation too, even though I consider such an undertaking to be a waste of time and money. The drama bomb that would erupt amongst the 9/11 Truth community if it reached an identical conclusion to the old one would be just delicious.</p>

<p>Interesting that papers take the place of the subject of TALKING about 9/11 for you. </p>

<p>At this point the academic community is <em>bored to death</em> with 9/11. A couple truthers spoke to MIT professors on the topic a year ago, and they said themselves that the profs could barely contain their <em>withering contempt</em> for the topic. Chomsky says so himself on any number of occasions. </p>

<p>Hell, even the subs here that are populated with engineers are bored to tears with the topic.</p>

<p>Nowhere near as funny as the truth movement I&#39;m afraid. </p>

<p>No thanks. </p>

<p>Boy, it seems the truth movement is just chock full of cursory studies. It&#39;s moving past the &quot;cursory&quot; part that seems to elude you. </p>

<p>Wake me when the scientific community takes you bozos seriously. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure the American academic community would be absolutely <em>teeming</em> with truthers if they weren&#39;t being &quot;censored&quot;. I mean, look at the <em>overwhelming support</em> you guys have built up among the academic communities of other first world countries like England, France, Canada or Australia.</p>

<p>...oh wait...none of them support you either. I guess the academic community of <em>every single first world country</em> is being &quot;censored&quot; by...someone.</p>

<p>What about the engineering communities of other first world countries? I mean, we already know the American engineering community thinks you&#39;re laughable, but surely with all the truth on your side, the engineers in other places have come out in wide support of the movement...right?</p>

<p>No?</p>

<p>Well, I guess they&#39;re being &quot;censored&quot; as well.</p>

<p>Surely the Architectural communities of other first world countries have come out in support of the truth movement, right? I mean, the AIA just voted overwhelmingly in the &quot;truthers are full of shit&quot; category, but you <em>must</em> have some support from the architectural community in other countries...</p>

<p>...whoops...swing and a miss. Must be that pesky &quot;censorship&quot;.</p>

<p>DEMOLITION EXPERTS! Certainly the demolitions experts have come out in your favor, right? I mean, the trade towers and WTC 7 were <em>undeniably</em> demolition jobs, right? Even a <em>blind fool</em> can see that! Certainly you MUST have wide support from an array of demolitions experts, right?</p>

<p>Nope, they think you&#39;re laughable too.</p>

<p>You know, when experts from every single relevant field think you&#39;re full of shit, chances are you&#39;re full of shit.</p>

<p>So if the professionals in the field are censored why are you bothering to call for a new investigation? If you don&#39;t trust the experts in the field of structural engineering, who exactly would you put in charge of it? Pharmacists? Meteorologists? Or are they in on it too?</p>

<p>Or will your new investigation only be stacked with that tiny groupuscule of engineers who have made clear they&#39;ve already fallen for your pet conspiracy theory?</p>

<p>Again, I&#39;m all for a new investigation and have outlined exactly who I think should staff it above. So give us a straight answer: <em>who</em> would be doing the investigation you&#39;re calling for?</p>

<p>Pretty simple.</p>

<p>Of course, I imagine truthers would come up with all kinds of tenuous &quot;connections&quot; to the CIA or Mossad or whatever to cover their asses - like you said, they tend to be deliberately vague about the composition of their &quot;independent&quot; investigation.</p>
