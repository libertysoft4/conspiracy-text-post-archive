    <div class="md"><p>The same reason credible scientists will say GMO&#39;s are perfectly safe for human consumption. Monsanto gives them $25,000 to further &quot;research&quot; in whatever they want. Money makes the world go round. It&#39;s not what&#39;s right or wrong, despite what you&#39;re raised being told. They tell us all that so the people making bank by any &amp; all means necessary don&#39;t have to worry about as much about competition. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s amazing how you guys say you don&#39;t drink the kool-aid, yadda yadda, but are so eager to drink it when it goes for what you want to believe.</p>

<p>The kool-aid in question is Kevin Folta pocketing $25,000 to do favorable research for Monsanto. That has <strong>never</strong> happened. He never got money from Monsanto for his research nor for himself. Monsanto donated to an outreach fund for students and farmers. That fund pays for travel expenses, hotel, meals, etc. for workshops on science communication. At most, Folta was allowed to choose a Subway sandwich paid with that fund. The horror! How dare he!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s amazing to me is that you&#39;ve lumped together three different things as if they were one and the same: 1) scientists, 2) lawmakers, and 3) capitalists.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.axismundionline.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/GMAuthoritiesnew1.jpg">overwhelming majority</a> of number 1) agree that <a href="http://genera.biofortified.org/viewall.php">genetic engineering is safe</a> and poses no greater risk than conventional crops. That&#39;s a <em>fact</em>.</p>

<p>Number 2) make decisions that vary from country to country according to their political stance and electorate. Under sufficient popular pressure, they&#39;ll ban something even if it&#39;s safe, because votes are more important than what number 1) says. For example, GMOs or homosexuality.</p>

<p>Number 3) want to make business and they do it whether there&#39;s a ban or not. Of course they&#39;ll want more freedom to sell their products, especially if there&#39;s no good reason to ban them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since you won&#39;t let this die, what I meant were things like the HR933 Provision. That was a spending bill aimed at averting a government shutdown &amp; ensuring the federal government would continue to be able to pay it&#39;s bills. It was passed in the dead of night &amp; signed into law by President Obama. Seems great until you dig into it and realize there&#39;s provisions protecting Monsanto from legal action in the event GMO&#39;s are shown to be harmful to people!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>President Barack Obama signed a spending bill, HR 933, into law on Tuesday that includes language that has food and consumer advocates and organic farmers up in arms over their contention that the so-called &quot;Monsanto Protection Act&quot; is a giveaway to corporations that was passed under the cover of darkness.</p>

<p>The &quot;Monsanto Protection Act&quot; effectively bars federal courts from being able to halt the sale or planting of controversial genetically modified (aka GMO) or genetically engineered (GE) seeds, no matter what health issues may arise concerning GMOs in the future. The advent of genetically modified seeds -- which has been driven by the massive Monsanto Company -- and their exploding use in farms across America came on fast and has proved a huge boon for Monsanto&#39;s profits.</p>

<p>The provision&#39;s language was apparently written in collusion with Monsanto. Lawmakers and companies working together to craft legislation is by no means a rare occurrence in this day and age. But the fact that Sen. Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, actually worked with Monsanto on a provision that in effect allows them to keep selling seeds, which can then go on to be planted, even if it is found to be harmful to consumers, is stunning. It&#39;s just another example of corporations bending Congress to their will, and it&#39;s one that could have dire risks for public health in America.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For starters, what&#39;s a provision about Monsanto not being prosecuted doing hidden in a government shutdown bill? That&#39;s shady as hell &amp; if a corporation like Monsanto expects the public to believe it has humans best interests at heart, you simply don&#39;t do things like this. The way I see it there are only two reasons you&#39;d put provisions like this into a bill;</p>

<p>1.) You aren&#39;t certain of the potential consequences of the product you&#39;re selling.</p>

<p>2.) You know the consequences of the product being sold are unsafe &amp; you want to cover your ass.</p>

<p>The former indicates not enough testing has been done to allow such a product to be put on the market while the latter is blatantly wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except it&#39;s not called the &quot;Monsanto Protection Act&quot; nor does it name Monsanto. That&#39;s a name given by propagandists bent on spinning facts. It was a provision to protect farmers who had crops that were being reviewed, so that they weren&#39;t forced to destroy their crops while the reviewing process went on. It was a temporary bypass that expired later.</p>

<p>a) Each GMO has to be evaluated separately; it is wrong to say &quot;all GMOs are good&quot; or &quot;all GMOs are bad&quot;.<br/>
Agreed. </p>

<p>b) I&#39;ve yet to see any clear evidence that any GMO is unsafe.<br/>
That&#39;s mostly due to the corruption and silencing/attacking of critics, but there are a few. </p>

<p>c) Animals and humans in USA have been consuming GMOs for decades, with no demonstrated harm.<br/>
Do we immediately feel the negative-effects of drinking soda? How would we really know if we didn&#39;t do any testing or studies? </p>

<p>d) There&#39;s no reason to think cross-breeding is any better or safer than GM technology, for creating new foods.<br/>
I think you meant selective breeding here and it&#39;s a method that&#39;s been around 500x longer and it doesn&#39;t result in transgenic organisms.</p>

<p>e) As of September 2014, EU has authorized 49 GMOs for use or animal or human consumption, according to Wikipedia&#39;s &quot;Regulation of genetically modified organisms in the European Union&quot;.<br/>
Not all of them were authorized and like you said in a) they can&#39;t all be treated the same and they should each be tested and studied individually. </p>

<p>They are doing it the right way by having labeling, traceability, and thorough research and studies done on each GMO. Did you know that foods in the US are different than foods elsewhere? We don&#39;t need to be taken advantage of.<br/>

<p>In some sense, we&#39;re ALL transgenic organisms.  Depending on what you count (DNA or genes), humans share a lot with other animals, plants, etc.  From <a href="http://www.thehumangenome.co.uk/THE_HUMAN_GENOME/Primer.html">http://www.thehumangenome.co.uk/THE_HUMAN_GENOME/Primer.html</a> :</p>

<p>&quot;Mouse and man share 99% genetic similarity - including the genes to make a tail.  Humans and mice shared a common ancestor about 100 million years ago.  A mouse has about the same number of genes as a man.  Due to preserved genetic similarities, even after 530 million years of separation, introduced human genes can operate within the Fruit Fly genome.  The nematode worm shares many genes with human beings, including the genes to make muscle.&quot;</p>

<p>Please read my reply to throwawayingtonville and please address. lol.</p>

<p>Yea, but that comes from a natural setting. In the case of GMOs, man has directly done work or made improvements on the DNA, so man should claim it. The distinction should be made that they are not the same, and that the product is no longer in its expected form. Since when has claiming work become an issue?</p>

<p>Yea, but when the experts are saying different things, then that&#39;s when you should start asking more questions. When scientists aren&#39;t able to do their jobs and when the industry is trying to keep the fact that they have worked on the products hidden and claiming that they are natural, then this is a problem and maybe it&#39;s not so smart to be so trusting.</p>

<p>2000+ studies that have found GMOs to be safe: <a href="http://www.geneticliteracyproject.org/2013/10/08/with-2000-global-studies-confirming-safety-gm-foods-among-most-analyzed-subject-in-science/">http://www.geneticliteracyproject.org/2013/10/08/with-2000-global-studies-confirming-safety-gm-foods-among-most-analyzed-subject-in-science/</a></p>

<p>The survey of AAAS scientists which found they&#39;re more confident in the safety of GMOs than they are the existence of human-caused climate change.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also the trillion meal study that found GMOs to be safe: <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonentine/2014/09/17/the-debate-about-gmo-safety-is-over-thanks-to-a-new-trillion-meal-study/">http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonentine/2014/09/17/the-debate-about-gmo-safety-is-over-thanks-to-a-new-trillion-meal-study/</a></p>

<p>And the list of world-respected organizations supporting the safety of GMOs:</p>

<p>American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Medical Association, the World Health Organization, the Royal Society of Medicine, the European Commission, the American Council on Science and Health, the American Diabetic Association, the American Society for Cell Biology, the American Society for Molecular Biology, the American Association of Plant Sciences, the International Seed Foundation, Society of Toxicology, seven world academies of science, the National Academy of Sciences, Food Standards Australia New Zealand, the Union of German Academics of Sciences and Humanities, etc.</p>

<p>And the hundred billion animal study: <a href="https://www.animalsciencepublications.org/publications/jas/articles/92/10/4255">https://www.animalsciencepublications.org/publications/jas/articles/92/10/4255</a></p>

<p>What evidence do you have that is stronger? Can you actually refute my facts or just do ad hominem shill attacks?</p>

<p>Edit: </p>

<p>Still waiting for evidence from any of the 11+ people who downvoted me. Really, it&#39;s crazy that you can&#39;t refute my claims at all. Most internet debates use studies or logic that go back and forth. I&#39;ve given trillions of meals, a hundred billion animals, a long list of world-respected science organizations, and 2000 studies. </p>

<p>In return, I haven&#39;t received anywhere close to a comparable amount of studies that have found GMOs to be unsafe. If downvoting and shill accusations is all you have left, it seems you&#39;ll soon be following the path of the anti-vaxxors.</p>

<p>Those are the first few titles of those studies and it looks like a majority of the studies aren&#39;t even about the safety of GMOs. Can you please tell us which rows contain studies that tested the safety of GMOs (feeding studies) and were done by independent scientists? Did you even look at any of them? Or are you just throwing that link around? </p>

<p>Instead, would you like to address these articles?<br/>

<p>Oh and for everyone else. :) Other information to be aware of. There are some users who will continuously brigade, seek out almost every Monsanto/GMO-related thread which has good activity, pile onto and exhaust other users, defend one another, lead each other into different ideas, repeatedly inject certain ideas, misinform, manipulate, etc. Look at their comment histories. Please do not be deceived.

<p>Also, you base your assessment of 1,783 studies on the titles of the first three? <a href="http://www.geneticliteracyproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Nicolia-20131.pdf">Have you looked at the meta-analysis?</a> They have a handy chart where they categorize the papers according to their topic, and there is indeed &#39;General literature&#39; and other topics not strictly related to safety.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t make any assessment. I assumed that since he&#39;s been throwing that link around, he would know something about it and wouldn&#39;t mislead people into thinking that 2000+ studies found GMOs to be safe, when most of those aren&#39;t even about GMO safety. That&#39;s the point that I&#39;m trying to make though. They are throwing around this information and don&#39;t even know what it&#39;s really about, but they go around arguing with people as if they know everything they say to be factual.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure.</p>

<p>The Huff Post article spends half its time supporting a retracted study. Most of the studies that the article supports have been criticized for small sample sizes. If the authors of those studies had strong results, why not just increase the sample size and resubmit? This would be the obvious thing to do because any evidence of GMOs being unsafe would be groundbreaking.</p>

<p>Your second link from nature is about the environmental impacts of GMOs. I was talking about the health impacts here.</p>

<p>Your third link also isn&#39;t about safety.</p>

<p>Then you attacked me for being a shill.</p>

<p>Look at the evidence of GMO safety I have listed above. I gave you 2000+ studies, a trillion meal study, a hundred billion animal study, endorsements from a huge list of scientific organizations, etc. The support for GMO safety is overwhelming. I&#39;ll ask you again: </p>

<p>Yes, we often trust experts.  Has your non-GMO food been tested, with independent long-term studies ?  Do you trust that the metal in your car was manufactured correctly ?  How can you be SURE that your tapwater or bottle water, every day or every bottle, is safe to drink ?</p>
