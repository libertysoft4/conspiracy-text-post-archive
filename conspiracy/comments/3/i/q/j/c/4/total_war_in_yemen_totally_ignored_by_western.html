    <div class="md"><p>With almost a whimper, the Western media reported that the US-backed regimes of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and their auxiliary fighters drawn from Al Qaeda have begun carrying out what is the ground invasion of Yemen. Along with an ongoing naval blockade and months of bombing raids, the ground invasion adds a lethal new dimension to the conflict – for both sides.</p>

<p>Landing at the port city of Aden on Yemen’s southern tip, it is reported that an “armor brigade” consisting of between 1,000 – 3,000 troops primarily from the UAE are now moving north, their ultimate destination Sana’a, the capital of Yemen.</p>

<p>Columns of the UAE’s French-built Leclerc main battle tanks were seen moving out of the port city though their numbers are difficult to establish. Reports claiming that the UAE unit is brigade-sized might indicate as many as 100 tanks involved – a third of the UAE’s total armored force.</p>

<p>The bold move comes after months of frustrating failures for the two Arabian regimes. Their Yemeni proxies – loyalists of the ousted president Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi – have proven all but useless in fighting Houthi fighters across most of Yemen despite air superiority provided to them by their Arabian allies. And while it appears the well-equipped Arab forces are able to concentrate firepower, overwhelming Houthi fighters in pitched battles, the ability for Saudi, UAE, and Al Qaeda forces to actually hold territory they move through is questionable at best.</p>

<h2>Opportunity</h2>

<p>The Roman Empire throughout much of its reign was feared as invincible. After suffering several major defeats, the veneer of invincibility began to peel and along with it crumbled inevitably their empire. Likewise, Western hegemony has been propped up by the illusion of military superiority on the battlefield. By carefully picking its battles and avoiding critical defeats, the West, and the US in particular, has maintained this illusion of military invincibility</p>

<p>As the US moves against nations with larger, better equipped and trained armies, it has elected to use proxies to fight on its behalf. Thus, any humiliating defeat could be compartmentalized.</p>

<p>However, by most accounts the war in Yemen is not only a proxy war between Iran and the Persian Gulf monarchies, it is one of several such conflicts raging regionally that constitutes a wider proxy war between the US and its regional allies on one side, and Iran, Syria, Russia, and even China on the other.</p>

<p>With the presence of Western main battle tanks in Yemen attempting to move north, the opportunity now presents itself to punch holes through this illusion of Western invincibility. Yemen as the graveyard for an alleged brigade of French-built Leclerc main battle tanks would be one such hole. It would also set the UAE’s extraterritorial military ambitions back, if not overturn them entirely, and finally, would leave whatever fighting was left in Yemen to the Saudis who have thus far proven incompetent.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is one of the many reasons the Western media has decided not to cover the events unfolding in Yemen.</p>

<h2>Yemen Vs. Ukraine</h2>

<p>One might ask how – in the context of international law – it is possible for unelected absolute autocracies like Saudi Arabia and the UAE to intervene militarily in Yemen with naval blockades, aerial bombardments, and now an overt ground invasion including armor columns to restore an ousted regime. This is done with seemingly little concern from the United Nations and with the enthusiastic support both politically and militarily of the United States.</p>

<p>The answer to this question becomes more confounding still when considering Western condemnation of Russia for any attempt to support or defend the ousted government of Ukraine, a nation now overrun by NATO-backed Neo-Nazi militias who in turn are backing a criminal regime in Kiev which includes foreigners assigned to cabinet positions and even as governors. Saudi and UAE military aggression in Yemen makes it increasingly difficult for the West to maintain the illusion of moral superiority regarding Ukraine.</p>

<p>Russia’s relative restraint when compared to US-backed aggression on the Arabian Peninsula exposes once again the pervasive hypocrisy consuming Western legitimacy.</p>

<p>This may be yet another reason the Western media refuses to cover the events unfolding in Yemen.</p>

<h2>Responsibility to Protect…?</h2>

<p>After NATO’s attempt to invoke the “responsibility to protect” (R2P) as justification for the destruction of Libya, it became clear that NATO was merely hiding behind the principles of humanitarian concern, not upholding them. And while it may be difficult to believe, there are still those across the Western media and policy think-tanks attempting to use R2P to justify further military aggression against nations like Syria.</p>

<p>However, R2P is conveniently absent amid what little talk of Yemen that does take place in the Western media. US-backed blockades and months of aerial bombardments have tipped Yemen toward a humanitarian catastrophe. Not only does both the UN and the West fail to demand an end to the bombings and blockades, the West has continued to underwrite Saudi Arabia and the UAE’s military adventure in Yemen.</p>

<p>The carnage and injustice visited upon Yemen serves as yet another stark example of how the West and its institutions, including the United Nations, are the greatest dangers to global peace and stability, using the pretext of defending such ideals as a means to instead undo them.</p>

<p>Considering this, we discover yet another potential reason the Western media’s coverage of Yemen is muted.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen how the Houthi fighters react to the ground invasion of Yemen by Emirati troops. Dealing severe losses to the UAE’s armor while continuing to weather aerial bombardment may see the stalling or even the withdrawal of this latest incursion. Not unlike the 2006 Lebanon War where Hezbollah fighters expertly used terrain to negate Israeli advantages in airpower and armor, forcing an early end to the fighting, the Houthis may yet answer this latest move by US-backed proxies operating in Yemen.</p>

<p>Perhaps this possibility above all, is why the Western media would rather the general public knew little of what was going on in Yemen. It would represent yet another conventional Western-equipped proxy army defeated by irregular forces in yet another failed campaign fought in the interests of Wall Street and Washington. While the Western media refuses to cover the events unfolding in Yemen with the attention and honesty they deserve, the conflict is nonetheless pivotal, and may determine the outcome of other proxy wars raging across the Middle East and North Africa, and even beyond.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why don&#39;t you tell everyone who the houthi fighters are. They are a Iranian backed terrorist group like Hezbollah.</p>

<p>Thus shout &quot;death to America, death to Israel/Jews, glory to Islam.&quot;  </p>

<p>They have this written on their flag, they are not the good guys here. They receive hundreds of millions and weapons from Iran.</p>

<p>They tried to bomb a nuclear reactor in Saudi Arabia recently. That would have been great for the region.</p>

<p>They are nothing more than Shia radicals and broke the cease fire on command from Iran, and have been allowing AQAP to resurge like nothing before.</p>

<p>This propaganda is hilarious. Hezbollah is another Iranian terrorist proxy, same ones in Iraq that ethnically cleansed Sunnis.</p>

<p>Talk about proxy wars sure, but mention the dictatorship in Irans role around the region.</p>

<p>Russia&#39;s restraint in Ukraine? This war would have been over if the Russian created separatist movement didn&#39;t get help from Russian troops incursions in the country. Russia invaded when its fake separatist movement was about to lose.</p>

<p>Russia couldn&#39;t do anything in Yemen if it wanted to. Their military is not capable of doing anything. Only the U.S. Can project power around the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course someone shows up with these ridiculous arguments within a short period of time.</p>

<p>Iranian backed terrorist groups? Basically you mean groups that are supported by independent countries not aligned with NATO and the West. Which by that you mean: Not supporting the countries that have been bombing them and the surrounding area for 100 years while refusing to let the genocide(make no mistake, that is what Israel has done) run rampant to a former country. Not to mention that Saudi Arabia is the number 1 haven for the majority of terrorist groups.</p>

<p>Russia restraint in Ukraine? That&#39;s exactly what that was. Imagine if Mexico decided it wanted to ally itself with China and Russia separating itself from the West. How long before the United States sent in military to secure its assets in the country? This is EXACTLY  what Russia did. They secured Crimea and it&#39;s largest port to the Black Sea and a key component to a presence in and around the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;m also not saying either Russia or the US is good. They both fucking suck IMO. That said your comment reeks of trying to dissuade any critical thinking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol Russia invaded and annexed Crimea. They created a separatist movement, nothing they did was justifiable. Saying America blah blah is whataboutisim. That doesn&#39;t justify anything.</p>

<p>Yes, houthis are Iranian terrorist proxies, nothing more.</p>

<p>Post some nonsense propaganda article, it&#39;s sad people are so ignorant they think a theocratic dictatorship that hangs gays, and opresses minorities and attempting to dominate the region is doing nothing wrong.</p>

<p>Once Iraq is over the Kurds hopfeully will get their land back from Iran, who has been oppressing the Kurds just like everyone else is.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you think Iran propping up Assas is a great thing and saying AQAP is backed by Saudi Arabia is a lie.</p>

<p>The U.S. and the Yemeni government was destroying AQAP, until the iraninan houthis proxy broke the cease fire and started a war. Multiple nations have taken to fighting. Look up the coalition fighting the houthi terrorists.  </p>

<p>Now the Houthis are losing land as is the Yemeni government now and AQAP is getting more powerful.</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia safe haven for terrorist? Really? Where did zarqawi go when he was chased out of Afghanistan, Iran. Safe haven for AQ has been Iran.</p>

<p>Not to mention Assads support for radical Sunnis in Iraq and Irans support for radicals Shias. Syria was a open border and IS&#39;s safe haven was Syria. Iran was backing Sunnis terrorists through Assad, and now Iran is funding baloch insurgents in Pakistan and some Taliban groups now.</p>

<p>Please, I know what&#39;s going on the Middle East. In been following it since the Iraq war.</p>

<p>Everyone seems to forget Syrias support for Baathists and Sunni radicals. Syria was the crossing point for foreign fighters.</p>

<p>But Irans support for the PMU instead of the Iraqi army shows yet again Irans attempt to dominate the Iraqi state and create a proxy force like Hezbollah. PMUs are filled with Shia war criminals from the Iraq occupation and terrorists.</p>

<p>Iran is nothing more than a radical Shia state and will support Sunni radicals if it meets their ends.</p>

<p>MSM doesn&#39;t report on Yemen because the ignorant US masses don&#39;t care. This article is nothing
more than propaganda. Unfortunately I know what&#39;s going on there, so I can see this BS article for what it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re either incredibly ignorant or paid in some way. I say this because of your constant use &quot;key&quot; words. I am unbiased towards this, you clearly have an agenda.</p>

<p>News flash: Russia did nothing to create the controversy currently happening in Ukraine. The West toppled a government and the ensuing situation is due to the power vacuum created by this action. Eastern Ukraine IS predominately Russian. Crimea is RUSSIAN. How do you invade a populace that wants you there? The reason a separatists movement even formed was because of the guiding of Ukraine towards joining NATO. Which unsurprisingly some countries actually don&#39;t want. These people associate with Russia more than they do with Ukraine. Hence why they would rather be part of Russia, which you exclude from your argument or just choose to ignore.</p>

<p>What does Saudi Arabia&#39;s government do? You want to bring up Iran&#39;s government so frequently yet you seem to (conveniently) ignore what the Governments who you support do. I have no love for Iran or it&#39;s government, but I equally despise Saudi Arabia as a disgusting menace in the Middle East. Do Saudi&#39;s not behead people, hang gays and the like? Oh right, they do. Saudi Arabia is a massive haven for terrorists and a quick google search will prove that. I&#39;m not wasting my time linking so you can throw more straw man arguments and change the subject.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve been following since the Iraq War. Perfect, because that would explain your clueless understanding of the situation. This has been going on for far longer than 12 years bud. I&#39;ve been following and researching as far back as the early 1900&#39;s. Assad is an Ally of Russia, that is where this conflict comes to fruition. I am not even going to waste any more time on you. You don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about at all.</p>

<p>Lol and Iran doesn&#39;t control the media as Russia does? Assad&#39;s media is state owned too, very funny. keep shilling for the Iranian theocratic dictatorship, just remember PJAK. </p>

<p>The Kurds are coming to take their land back and kurds are getting ready for war against iran, if Iran doesn&#39;t stop oppressing the kurds there :). Hopefully the dictatorship makes concession to the minorities there. Iran should stop funding proxy terrorists around the region, and propping up dictatorships like Assad.</p>

<p>We had a AMA from a Kurdish fighter talking about the Iranian situation, they are not happy. Iran has a buildup of its military on their border, and the Kurds are not forgetting their other enemy.</p>

<p>Assad is losing, Iran&#39;s pipeline to hezbollah gets cut. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabian-led_intervention_in_Yemen">Iran&#39;s proxies are being destroyed in yemen by a Arab coalition</a></p>

<p>Russia has been exposed in Europe and his country is getting fucked by the west. Putler must be shaking in his boots, he can&#39;t afford Crimea nor donbass.</p>

<p>Lol his gas pipeline with China, hailed by Putlerists as a victory is going to LOSE MONEY because of prices, China fucked Russia good there. Oil prices are going lower, gas prices are going to go lower, Russia is looking weaker and weaker :). Dicator Putler might have to leave office, his reign of terror ending.</p>

<p>Russia is losing and hopefully Iran loses, then we will have peace and democracy in the region :).</p>

<p>You haven&#39;t proved you know anything, especially when you don&#39;t even mention Syria is a ally of Iran. You don&#39;t know as much as me, i promise you that.</p>

<p>You do know IRGC are fighting in Syria with Shia mercenaries and Afghan shia&#39;s, some being forced to fight in the attempt to prop up Assad&#39;s dictatorship.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>how – in the context of international law – it is possible for unelected absolute autocracies like Saudi Arabia and the UAE to intervene militarily in Yemen with naval blockades, aerial bombardments, and now an overt ground invasion including armor columns to restore an ousted regime. This is done with seemingly little concern from the United Nations and with the enthusiastic support both politically and militarily of the United States.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They support the bombing of this country, they support the &quot;rebels&quot; in Syria and Libya, they support the ISIS terrorists, and not a peep from the EU or the world or anyone else. But as soon as Russia decides to put a stop to the murder of Russian people in Ukraine, the whole world erupts and starts vilifying Putin.</p>
