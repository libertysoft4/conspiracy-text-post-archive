<p>In the second place, even if they had been, there&#39;s not one single mention of &quot;shill&quot; in any of those posts.</p>

<p>Thanks for getting me to waste my time with unfounded complaints.</p>

<p>... and in the third place, reading back through your comments I find that you&#39;ve made a ton of personal attacks on other users. I&#39;ll now be removing all of them that violate our rules. Thanks for bringing yourself to my attention.</p>

<p>You are aware that we have a no trolling rule too... right?</p>

<p>Edit: Now that I&#39;ve gone through a few and found so many rules violations, you may consider this your only warning. Any further violations will result in a ban.</p>

<p>The place is deserted except for them.</p>

<p>The only three people there, reporter, interviewee and cameraman( though this is understandable ) act as if shooter doesn&#39;t exist. They don&#39;t acknowledge his presence in any way what so ever. He was right next to them for what seemed quite a while.</p>

<p>The reporter didn&#39;t appear to actually be getting hit by bullets. Her body did not exhibit that jolt. Nor did she get knocked back in the slightest by the &quot;bullets&quot; hitting her.</p>

<p>No blood mist from exiting bullets shot from point blank range and she can still stay on her feet and run away and film conveniently ends at critical moment like an ISIS beheading video. The real meat and potatoes is missing. </p>

<p>How did shooter know to be there at that specific time? Any witnesses see him enter the facility?</p>

<p>There are a few explanations: Local news stations regularly tweet what their reporters are doing. As a former employee he might known how to find where reporters are. He might have been driving by and saw the news van.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whoa nelly! I&#39;m just asking questions.  If you are a news reporter as you say, maybe you can understand. However, you most likely being an MSM fluffernutters and bullshit reporter, you have NEVER asked any real controversial questions that would ruffle the feathers of an authority figure and anger your masters. You must stay with the narrative. You&#39;ve probably only reported on the local town hall meetings and grandma&#39;s missing cat for all I know. </p>

<p>Go ahead and call me a retard. I&#39;ve been called worse. I haven&#39;t declared that this event is fake. I&#39;m sorting through all of the available information that I can get ahold of and make a decision on my own, not what some half wit news anchor is telling me to believe. Arriving to a decision is fluid...sometimes things look staged and then they don&#39;t. If that angers you, maybe you should wonder why you were taught to think that way...but I don&#39;t give a shit about what you think. People like you will never mold the way I think and learn. </p>

<p>But what is worse in my book is an MSM news &quot;reporter&quot; whose job is not investigating and asking tough questions in order to bring truth to the public, but one that knowing or ignorantly goes with the establishment narrative to further political agendas. Either because of cowardice or apathy, lack of conscience or a plant...it&#39;s pathetic and extremely damaging to the quality of life for everyone who has no other capability to view the world by.</p>

You don&#39;t have to believe me and I think if I provided evidence you would find some fault in it.

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with most &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; is that they think TOO much. A shooting like this could very likely be a hoax, wherein the shooter is a government-hired assassin. Especially in cases where the assailant kills himself. This DOESN&#39;T mean that the victims are ALSO actors. That&#39;s what I hate about the douchebag who claims that Sandy Hook never actually happened, offering 25k to the parents of dead kids for &quot;proof&quot;. Well yes, it did happen. Children died. That doesn&#39;t, however, mean that it wasn&#39;t set up by the government.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like some of these people believe that TPTB are able and willing to fake the deaths of 100s of people to push an agenda, but arent willing to ACTUALLY KILL a few people in order to push an agenda. They think that the government will poison the vaccines that are being pushed into millions of people each year, but NOPE, no way they would kill a few people to push an agenda. Seriously...?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pushing what agenda? The &#39;coming for your guns&#39; agenda? If Sandy Hook didn&#39;t manage to push the agenda with the deaths of all those kids, then this shooting of two nobodies (outside of their local viewing area, friends and family, RIP) is going to accomplish even less than that. </p>

<p>The only reason that this might have any effect at all, is that it was caught on tape. </p>

<p>And I can already tell you what&#39;s going to happen. Anyone not directly affected by this will forget about this story within two days. Local, and some national politicians will spout &#39;deep regret for this senseless tragedy&#39; and the ones who are for some measure of gun control will rattle off a talking point or two to satisfy their constituents.</p>

<p>If this is a false flag operation to push an agenda, I would fire whoever was behind this asap.   </p>

<p>Remind me again. How many laws has the President signed into law restricting gun ownership?</p>

Saw about 20 police cars in the middle of I-66 E, the silver suspect car and what appeared to be a coffin.</p>

<p>This is a tweet from the BBC reporter who was forced to delete his footage by the VA police. We&#39;ll never be able to see his footage now since the VA police forced him to delete it. But if there was really a coffin there, that&#39;s a huge red flag. He supposedly died in the hospital. Why would they bring a coffin to the scene?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i agree with what you&#39;re saying.  and i just want to reiterate that i don&#39;t believe this was a conspiracy and they hired someone to kill himself.  but, people do keep families in mind and if they&#39;re already unstable and offered their family decent compensation for making  a sacrifice i really don&#39;t think it&#39;s much of a stretch to hire someone to kill and them kill themselves.</p>

<p>for instance, have you seen gangs of new york?  there&#39;s a scene where bill the butcher offers a guy whose about to be hung $0.50 cents for a locket. the locket had sentimental value for the dude because it had his mom on it but he took the deal and proceeded to get hung.  obviously a movie but like i said i don&#39;t think it&#39;s a stretch for someone to accept death as part of a deal.</p>

<p>I can assure you that I&#39;m not &quot;trolling&quot; you. I am who I am, and I&#39;m gonna put my opinions out there, just like you are. Not everyone who disagrees with you is a &quot;retard&quot; or a &quot;troll&quot;. Sometimes, you might just be wrong. Other times, you might be right, and everyone else is wrong. Other times, there is no &quot;wrong and right&quot;... These are called OPINIONS! But watch what you fucking say to other people, and what you call other people. You&#39;re a fucking bully. You need to resort to name-calling in order to validate your opinions. In that regard--- fuck you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nono I didn&#39;t mean that. Evidence comes from many less sickening directions. Like the fact that there are no birth or death records for those children - birth in some cases, but no death certificates whatsoever. These documents are always recorded and publicly available, as a matter of census. There being no official record of somebody&#39;s life is very, very questionable. </p>

<p>Bit relatiatory to presume that I was in any way suggesting asking bereaved parents. That would do nobody any good, no matter what the outcome. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it&#39;s very sad to experience that on a sub that touts &quot;free speech&quot; and all of that bullshit... The mods are good about not deleting opinions, but the mods can&#39;t save us from downvote brigades against logic. Just say what you wanna say, I guess that&#39;s the only advice I can give you. I always try to level (to an extent) with those who I&#39;m trying to communicate with. I don&#39;t say &quot;NO, you&#39;re fucking wrong.&quot; But I DO say &quot;No, you&#39;re fucking wrong, and here&#39;s why....&quot;</p>

<p>This is the EXACT reason why &quot;25k to any parent who provides me with proof that Sandy Hook happened&quot; guy will never get any proof... because it doesn&#39;t matter what &quot;proof&quot; he gets-- it will always be &quot;bullshit fake government-fabricated&quot; proof to him. People who have half a brain realize that he&#39;s not worth the time. He&#39;s fighting a winning battle (in his mind). He can always say, &quot;FAKE!&quot; and nobody can refute that there is a POSSIBILITY that it is fake. As menial as the possibility may be, it is POSSIBLE (technically)...</p>

<p>Name any &quot;accepted&quot; topic. Guess what? There is a theory out there that doubts that topic. This is the reason that we (as humanity) haven&#39;t accepted anything as &quot;law&quot; since the 1800s... everything is a &quot;theory&quot; these days. I&#39;m pretty sure that we (as humanity) decided that the Earth is NOT flat... guess what? Here we are in 2015, and there are still people who are claiming that this &quot;theory&quot; is bullshit, and the Earth is ACTUALLY flat! What in the actual fuck? Sometimes I want to visit you people, and give you a nice slap across the face. But I can&#39;t, because this is the internet, and everyone has a voice. Even those who are clinically insane.</p>

These are specialized agents who spend most of their lives &quot;in character&quot; thus not arousing suspicion. Look at the Newtown &quot;parents&quot; for a prime example. These are agents who continue to live in their communities playing the character they were assigned, sometimes deployed many years in advance of the event they were deployed to portray.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well then I assert the theory it was all the plan of a flying spaghetti monster in order to incite more racial tension and violence, while at the same time generating fear from the pro-gunownership population that firearms will be harder to obtain. This will cause a spike in guns purchases and will allow that flying spaghetti monster to gain a quick profit from his interest in Smith and Wesson (a publicly traded company).</p>

<p>My point is that the majority of us read this sub for conspiracy theories that make sense, and this one doesn&#39;t really make sense. If someone pulls together some support to show otherwise, then that&#39;s a different story.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>That she looked at him would pretty much indicate that she noticed him.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I find her reaction to being shot at odd.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Screaming?  Running Away?  Sounds pretty normal to me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>She clutched her upper Right abdomen like she&#39;d been shot but there&#39;s no blood on her hands or no mark that you see from the bullet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not unusual for only being able to see a couple of second after she was shot.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The blood should be flowing, other shootings I&#39;ve scene are messed up with the amount of blood.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And there are plenty of shootings that look like this.  Sometimes it takes more than a few seconds for the blood to start flowing, maybe the more fatal shots were after she was off camera.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then runs away with no problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s actually very common and realistic.  Many people who have been shot and survived report that many times they didn&#39;t even realize they had been shot for some time, often until they&#39;ve actually noticed they&#39;re bleeding.  The whole reason we have Adrenaline running through our veins is specifically so we can run away from danger.  This is real life, not a movie.  People who are shot don&#39;t always just instantly fall down dead.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I find it off that the women she was speaking with was in local government and was the only survivor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And if she was the only one killed you&#39;d think that was &quot;off&quot;.  Or if they all were killed that would be odd.  There is no combination of dead and alive people in this scenario that wouldn&#39;t seen odd.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s more but I don&#39;t think it matters, it just didn&#39;t seem right to me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s because it&#39;s not right.  It was an extraordinary event.  If it seemed totally normal to you that would be weird.  But don&#39;t conflate your reaction to it being abnormal with the assumption that it is abnormal because someone is bullshitting you with a fake.</p>

<p>blood on the floor</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This part especially.</p>

<p>In the live footage (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAH6SACn9lE&amp;amp;oref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DpAH6SACn9lE&amp;amp;has_verified=1">example here)</a> you can clearly see--in this case at the 13+ second mark, just before it cuts back to the anchor--specks of the cameraman&#39;s blood hitting the deck.</p>

<p>I&#39;m leaning heavily toward:  This is <em>not</em> a mock up; this is the real deal, imo.</p>

<p>I admit that when I saw the first person footage from the shooter I was a little skeptical about its authenticity.  The most apparent observation that I made of this video is that the shooter seems incompetent with the gun.  The first shot seems to miss, probably the second and third as well... then he puts the camera down and we don&#39;t see the rest.  </p>

<p>Reviewing the live footage and noticing the blood, which I had missed the first time, is what makes me think that this is not a fake event.</p>

Perhaps this doesn&#39;t mean anything, but if you watch CNN and believe everything they say well buddy, I have some bad news for you. Now, once again, I&#39;m not implying anything, just saying that you shouldn&#39;t just &#39;&#39;carry on&#39;&#39; because everything &#39;&#39;looks&#39;&#39; plausible on TV. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, what&#39;s more plausible.  The lighting made his hands appear a lighter shade, or the government accidentally hired a white dude to play the roll of a black guy.</p>

<p>When your only evidence is conjecture, you have to consider these kind of simple, common sense explanations.</p>

<p>EDIT: as for the twitter time stamp, some googling will show the twitter time stamp is often not exact.  It has been an issue in the past, and I don&#39;t use twitter but I&#39;d imagine it still occurs.  Considering the other logical option is the male news anchor is a government operative who has faked his entire life for this one operation, I again implore you to consider which is more likely.</p>

<p>EDIT 2:  there is a far more satisfactory explanation of the twitter timestamp anomaly in the comments below.  Spoiler alert:  no, it&#39;s not because a covert government crisis actor screwed up the timing of his lines.</p>

Each bullet has 425 ft-lbs of force, you don&#39;t run away from that. How would you sprint away when your hips are shattered from the impact? How about the fact that there is no air ripple in her clothes? No blood splatter on the surface behind her? The camera is placed down gently in just the right angle in order to get a brief glimpse of the masked gunman.</p>

<p>Look at OP&#39;s third link.

<p>Make sense?</p>

<p>The timestamp on the TV feed (which is only broadcast locally) is 6:42 AM. This is EST, seeing as Virginia is in the eastern time zone. The guy tweeted his condolences 3 hours later, at 9:36 AM EST. To someone in the Pacific Time Zone, that tweet would appear on their time line at 6:36 AM.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the US military wanted it&#39;s citizens dead they would be dead.  End of story.  We don&#39;t need fluoride, vaccines, or to take your guns.  We have drones that can kill you from 13,000 ft in the air being controlled by some 19 year old in Colorado that could destroy you, your family, your house and everything you love in less than five seconds while you garden at your home in Florida.</p>

<p>I&#39;m in field artillery.  My unit fires the <a href="http://www.army-technology.com/projects/paladin/">M109A6 Paladin self propelled artillery</a>.  Just my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery_battery">battery</a> -at 39 rounds of 155mm basic HE shells on 4-6 cannons- could completely level any small town in America.  And we could do it from 25 miles away. Now imagine my battery makes up a battalion, and that battalion makes up a brigade.  The US army has almost 20 artillery brigades and more then double that in regiments.</p>

<p>Not to mention SCUD missiles, Cruise missiles, a single fighter or fighter bomber, or a single B-52 Stratofortress capable of carrying 70,000 pounds of ordinance, any special forces unit, hell I would bet you could take a unit of cooks (since we all receive the same basic training) and fair pretty well against an entire town of people who have NEVER received combat training...</p>

<p>The government wants your guns?  Tell me, what is your single shot bolt action 30_06 going to do against <em>any</em> of that?</p>

that blog picture above shows a white man holding a gun. the idea behind this false flag would be deceit and subversion so obviously a white agent in this case killing 2 people and framing the black man with this social media trail, just didn&#39;t plan on anyone capturing the real shooter.

    <div class="md"><p>My point has never been any clearer, it is literally everywhere around us. If you can&#39;t see it then I am sorry but look again.</p>

<p>It&#39;s fake. It&#39;s just simply not real. Even individual human interactions are subject to control nowadays. We all need to get the fuck off of our computers, stop caring about what happens on fake tv, and actually do something that is tangible. Whether that&#39;s creating a community that is separate from modern, &quot;entertainment&quot; and focus on people and relationships or simply turning off the news and not caring about what the government is screaming desperately for us to believe in, it isn&#39;t important. </p>

<p>The world we live in is bull-shit. Entertainment is crap and only exists for advertisement, sports are the same. They&#39;re so good at it that they can not only distract you, but hold 100% of your attention <em>and</em> implant messages of &quot;buy this&quot; &quot;believe this&quot; into your mind at the same time. Companies gather money year-round with their designed, use-break-replace products from people who can&#39;t afford them in the first place. Why does this happen, and why are people so stupid that they buy items based on commercials and lies and not pure, true functionality? Is it because they&#39;ve been conditioned from birth (by their parents fault, majorly) to associate television and commercials with comfort, safety, and food? How many people grow up with the couch, chips, and the tv as their only source of entertainment? I see it everywhere around me.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just fake, there&#39;s no deeper meaning. There&#39;s no reading into it. Whether it&#39;s completely fabricated, exaggerated, or an induced situation doesn&#39;t matter, it&#39;s still not real or random. We&#39;ve been conditioned our entire lives to just believe it, to hope, because <em>the good guys always win</em>.</p>

<p>I dare you to find me a non-obscure movie or show where the &quot;bad&quot; guy isn&#39;t stronger/more prepared than the &quot;good&quot; guy and the good guy doesn&#39;t prevail. They want us to think illogically, so that despite any measures taken against us, we should hope for the &quot;right&quot; thing and simply expect it to happen without doing anything ourselves because the good guys are out there...somewhere. Well when the good guys are all at  their (rent-controlled) homes watching sports or tv (on their disposable screens) and munching on whatever, and the bad guys are all in positions of power and wealth, the world becomes the antithesis of what we&#39;re supposed to think that it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, however the overwhelming fakeness is what he is talking about. Even real events partake of this fakeness in a way. For example, no one could deny that the police killing unarmed black people in America is not real, however it&#39;s undeniable that no one cared about it until the media started to make it a thing. Whether you think this is a good thing or not is irrelevant, it&#39;s a media generated outrage. They just as easily could have told people to focus on something else and they would have.</p>

<p>This is the way most people live their lives, just being directed by the media and doing what the media tells them to do, and thinking what the media tells them to think. It&#39;s quite disturbing in a way, but once I looked for it, I noticed most of my friends display the most extreme emotions I&#39;ve ever seen then display ever while watching TV. Crying, hysterically laughing, anger, etc. all being shown directly to and at something that is fake. People that literally do not give a shit about their own real lives in any fashion will weep uncontrollably at the fictional character pretending to die on a flickering screen in front of them. </p>

<p>Maybe you have great friends, but when you are around people it&#39;s fun to play a little game where you wait for someone to bring up something that has nothing to do with the media. Often the media domination of the conversation is damn near 100%, people just discussing popular rappers, then a music feud, then sports stars, then a new TV show coming out, then a new movie they saw... all these things are fake to some extent, or at least less real than their &quot;real life&quot;.</p>

<p>I hope that makes sense. It&#39;s really difficult to discuss these things. I hope it doesn&#39;t seem like I&#39;m rambling but I&#39;m trying to show you what I mean. Fake is not the right word but it&#39;s close. If you&#39;re really interested you should check out Simulacra and Simulation (at least the first chapter, Procession of Simulacra) by Baudrillard or Society of the Spectacle by Guy Debroad. Sorry if you&#39;ve read these already.</p>

<p>How are people supposed to care about something that they are not aware of?</p>

<p>More of the &quot;you aren&#39;t grieving the way I demand you to - you must be a crisis actor&quot; meme? People react to and grieve in completely insane looking ways if it were part of fiction when faced with real issues in their personal lives.</p>

<p>Look up the stages of grief - it isn&#39;t as if we don&#39;t have close to 100 years of research on this. You are falling into the trap of people not reacting the way a screenwriter would expect them to - so they must be being coached by a script.</p>

<p>More &quot;you are deluded if you enjoy pop culture&quot; shaming. Typical &quot;I am superior to you because I do find enjoyment in different things than you&quot; attitude that is so widespread on reddit.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s go back to the start of the conversation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How saying &#39;&#39;not everything is a conspiracy&quot; is a baseless statement ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The OP is literally saying that <strong>everything</strong> that has ever happened is a conspiracy - that completely invalidates the definition of the word - see the sidebar.</p>

<p>I think you&#39;re reading what you want to see into my statements. For example here I&#39;m talking about TV that is literally fake, like Dr. Who or Seinfeld for example. I was making the point that people seem to emote more heavily while watching these shows than when they are actually living their lives.</p>

<p>Is it because they&#39;ve been conditioned from birth</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. That&#39;s why. It is difficult to undo or change one&#39;s conditioning though it is essential to recognize it as such and ditch destructive responses.</p>

<p>Anyway, I agree with you completely. That&#39;s why I do not watch television at all. It is pure indoctrination.</p>

<p>It is becoming harder for people to see through the hype these days. Human beings, for the most part, have completely lost touch with actuality. They live exclusively in the realm created by thought. This is why we can&#39;t have nice things.</p>

<p>Have the seen the movie &quot;They Live&quot; by Carpenter? It&#39;s a perfect illustration of what you&#39;re saying. It&#39;s a great movie. My favorite part is when the protagonist, who has figured out how to perceive the alien invaders with special sunglasses tries to convince his friend to try on the sunglasses and see for himself.</p>

<p>What follows is one of the longest, most brutal fights in movie history. It is meant to symbolize how hard most of us fight to deny reality. How hard we cling to the shoddiest lies if they comfort us even a little. If you haven&#39;t seen it, watch it. It will help to explain the downvotes.</p>

<p>the man&#39;s hands in the selfie video of the shooting are those of a white man, and Vester Flanagan aka Bryce Williams was a black man.  This will be used for gun control and race baiting</p>

The alleged shooter is light skinned African American wearing a black shirt in the camera man&#39;s video. A friend of mine is about that skin color and he constantly jokes that his hands are white man hands. He compares them to his white friends&#39; hands and we all joke that he had a hand transplant or some thing. And as for the shirt color? Photo shop is a hell of a program and fixes a multitude of sins. I do not believe this is a hoax. Its a tragedy, plain and simple. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, my heart goes out to all gun violence victims and their families everywhere.  It is an ongoing symptom of the much larger problems our society refuses to face on a daily, sometimes hourly basis.  However, this video raises more questions about the narrative we have been told today.  </p>

<p>I just watched the side by side version, from this link (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfT5AfDErRo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfT5AfDErRo</a>) which has the videos slightly out of sync.  On YouTube, you can slow the footage down to 25% in the Video Settings.  You can also move the cursor back and forth while paused and almost go frame by frame.  I took a close look at this footage at normal speed, at 25%, and frame by frame.</p>

<p>The gunman is firing what appears to be a 9mm semi-auto at point blank range.  Unless the first shot was a clean miss, not only should the victim have been knocked over immediately, but you should be able to see the impact of something in/on the victim&#39;s clothing, and certainly some sort of blood as the victim is running away, in both camera views.  How this played out after the victims are out of frame, I will await more information.  However, from this footage, I don&#39;t see anyone being shot, just shot at.  To me, he&#39;s either shooting blanks, or he just misses on the first shot, which is the only clear shot you see in both views.</p>

<p>As far as the plaid sleeve, the news crew camera is shooting into a dark background when it hits the ground and the shooter comes into frame.  When paused, it appears to me that he is wearing dark clothing, that could be plaid, but the lighting is such that it appears different, especially when viewed at normal speed.</p>

<p>No, this is not an embarrassment to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.  This is precisely why this community exists... to call into question the narrative that the media distributes regarding everything.  There is an agenda at work here, and really, with every breaking news story.  They are not informing us as much as they are inducing us to think the way they want us to.  Yes, this is a terrible tragedy, and again my heart goes out the victims and their families.  At the same time, something does not add up here. </p>

I took some time to look at the video &quot;evidence&quot; that has been presented to the public today, and have clearly stated what I see. From the footage, there is no proof of anything but someone firing a gun at a news crew during an interview.  I see someone being shot at, not shot.  Could this be a fake? Certainly.  Could he have missed the first shot and slayed these people in cold blood as the media narrative has directed us to believe... Absolutely.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not attributing you to anything that anyone else said. Im simply arguing what your post implies. Is it possible that he was shooting blanks and it was all staged? Yep, it sure is possible. But if thats the case, then surely these 4 individuals (one being a local government official) didnt just continue their lives as normal. Even if they were actors, as insane as that is to believe, they literally could not be seen by ANYONE from now on. &quot;Hey, aren&#39;t you that news anchor who got killed on live TV?&quot; Their faces are EVERYWHERE right now. They would literally have to disappear in order for this to be a huge &quot;everything was faked&quot; conspiracy. Hence my &quot;remote bunker in the middle of nowhere&quot; comment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, there is no need to infuse language into this discussion.  If you can&#39;t have a cogent discussion without throwing words around unnecessarily, don&#39;t reply. </p>

<p>However, you are absolutely attributing to me the theory that they are hiding in a bunker somewhere, and even said that it&#39;s &quot;just plain f&#39;ing wrong&quot;.  And, why the hostility?  </p>

<p>What is wrong, is that the one clear shot that is shown in both videos does not show an impact.  This video at the :40 mark <a href="http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=f2b_1433676159">http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=f2b_1433676159</a> shows what a 9 mm impact looks like. </p>

<p>There is no way that in today&#39;s footage, this victim has been shot.  What happened after that, as she&#39;s running away and out of frame, neither you or I, or anyone but the Police Forensic unit has any clue of.  Since the shooter took his own life, there will be no public trial, thus, no evidence presented in a court of law.  You also do not know if these victims are laying in a morgue, or in a bunker somewhere.  As far as the &quot;government official&quot; that was being interviewed and who was also allegedly shot, she has been reported as recovering from her wounds.  I am certain we will hear her story in the near future.</p>

<p>I stand behind what I have said here.  I have not made any irrational assumptions, as you obviously have.  I have merely stated that from this footage, there is no conclusive proof that anyone was shot... just shot at.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve made irrational assumptions? Haha. Ok. Most people would call my assumption &quot;logical&quot;. Most would call your &quot;questions&quot; (assumptions masked as questions) insane.</p>

<p>I guess the difference is that I see one filmed shot that doesn&#39;t make impact, and assume it was a miss, with a number of the 10 or so succeeding shots (which we don&#39;t see) hitting the target.  You see one filmed shot, and assume it was a blank, and the succeeding 10 or so shots must also be blanks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it adds nothing to the discussion, tbh.  And yes, with an absence of any evidence to the contrary, we can only go by the assumptions given to us by the media.  This video is the centerpiece of that narrative.  Until I slowed down the footage and looked at it closely, did I realize that the victim was not hit in the first shot.  The rest of the footage is jittery.  So yes, absolutely, I question what is going on here.</p>

<p>And your keywords here are &quot;(which we don&#39;t see)&quot;.  We don&#39;t see the other 10 shots, but we do see the first shot from point blank range and it is a clean miss, or there are no bullets in the shells he is firing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But you do realize that your line of thinking isn&#39;t &quot;logical&quot;, right? You, yourself, admitted that you&#39;re a hunter and have seen a deer run for 100 yards after being shot. Adrenaline, brother. You should know that her running away after being shot (presumably in the shoulder or arm, based on the video, assuming the first shot DID hit) by a 9mm doesn&#39;t provide any evidence to your claim. If the first shot DIDN&#39;T hit, then her running away makes even MORE sense.</p>

<p>In my opinion, you&#39;re just as guilty of jumping to conclusions as I am. </p>

<p>After video of ONE shot fired (damn, the gov is getting pretty ballsy with their hoaxes, amirite?):</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You&#39;re immediately questioning if the bullets were blanks. Based on that question, you&#39;re ultimately immediately questioning whether or not the whole incident was faked. Therefore, the final 10 shots were also blanks. All of these &quot;crisis actors&quot; are now in hiding, and have a lifelong secret that they can never tell a single soul, no matter what.</p></li>
<li><p>I&#39;m immediately questioning whether or not the first shot hit or missed. I assume that some of the next 10 shots (not on film) hit their targets.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>How am I guilty of making assumptions?  I merely stated the fact that it does not appear that the victim is hit in the footage that has been presented today.  Both points of view, when slowed down an examined carefully, do not show a hit.  What happens off frame is all assumption and conjecture.  My only statement, which I guess you could call an assumption, is that from 3 feet away, he&#39;s either a very poor shot, or he does not have bullets in the shells he is firing.  It&#39;s kind of an either or situation, and if you want to call it an assumption, so be it.  </p>

<p>I have not, in any of my statements, said anything about crisis actors, hoaxes, bunkers, or any of the drivel you are trying to attribute to me.  I have only commented at what is seen in the footage, and from that footage, I do not see anyone getting hit by bullets.  There is no impact, no blood, nothing to PROVE that the victim was shot.  </p>

<p>What happens when the footage goes jiggly and blurry, when the camera goes dark, who knows.  Anything anyone says at that point is pure conjecture.  The true assumption is that yes, he shot 3 people, killed two of them, then later killed himself because that is the media narrative.  But in this footage, there is no proof!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What doesn&#39;t add up to me is that the shooter claims to use hollow point bullets.  Even if he missed the first time, the impact of a HP bullet is designed to fuck someone up . When the hollowpoint bullet strikes a semi-solid object (such as a human body), the dimple allows the bullet to expand, opening up almost like an umbrella or a parachute does. Some hollowpoint bullets are also designed to fragment as they expand.</p>

<p>So if this shooter used HP bullets like he says he did, then the whole argument over whether or not the bullets would &quot;stop her in her tracks&quot; is nullified.  She would have been stopped the second she got hit.  </p>

<p>You could argue that he missed her on all three shots, though.</p>

<p>The first picture I posted is the last thing the cameraman&#39;s camera sees in the videos released.</p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t mean I think &quot;the shooting was fake and victims are living in an underground bunker somewhere&quot; as everyone is so quick to say in this thread, but it is strange, could have been a different perp., etc..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A couple of questions i have.<br/>
1. Why would the cameraman have been filming the ocean during the interview. I&#39;m not involved in the &quot;news&quot; business in any way but shouldn&#39;t they have done that kind of shot before the interview and already had the shot ready for the producers to mix in.  </p>

<ol>
<li>Why is it that all of the &quot;crazed&quot; black gunmen have the clarity of thought to sit down and write their doctoral thesis on why they&#39;ve chosen to kill people. </li>

If he filmed this himself (the shooter) how the fuck did this video get on the net?
Surely he didn&#39;t just shot them, then calmly upload the video to the internet.
If the police see. the video on his phone (go pro I have also heard) there not going to release it are they.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone speaking of this will obviously get downvoted to hell, but yeah I think it was fake. I saw the video where he&#39;s walking from the end of the walkway and comes very close to them, then when he pulls the gun out her head slightly looks right. Then he holds it 2 feet from 3 people and NOBODY even noticed that this big black man that they used to work with and be close to was standing next to them? Then there&#39;s no blood anywhere, when he shoots at her the first three times her shirt doesn&#39;t move and there&#39;s no blood spatter. No shell casings are seen or heard when he shoots, even blanks use shells. Idk man if three people got shot and two of them died, I would expect to see at least a little blood, if not pools of it.</p>

<p>And yeah there&#39;s no evidence that it was fake, but there&#39;s also little evidence that it was real. Yeah the actors may have done a good job and their pr team hyped up the fact that two twenty somethings just got murdered who were in love with their fiances and all that stuff Americans like, but there&#39;s no crime scene photos or evidence being shown to prove this happened. But if you question it, you&#39;re an asshole. </p>

<p>It&#39;s sandy hook all over again, in a year it will be forgotten and people who question it will be mocked. </p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;m all for believing it happened, just show me some fucking evidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>just look for evidence that it did happen not that it didn&#39;t.  you can always say something didn&#39;t happen because you&#39;ll rationalize every piece of evidence with minor counterpoint and justify that it&#39;s  a hoax. </p>

<p>you can search my previous comments.  i&#39;ve been pretty active on these threads for the past two days.  </p>

<p>2-3 ft away is bs.  he was more like 10ft away with a zoomed camera.  notice there is a camera man between him and the reporter.</p>

<p>you&#39;re not going to see any shell casings because every single shot he took on camera the ejection port was off camera.  look for yourself.  </p>

<p>have you considered he possibly missed the first few shots?  she was at a side profile and he was holding a gun with 1 hand.  hardly any easy shot from even 10ft away.  i assume you&#39;ve gone shooting and you&#39;d be able to verify this.  even with a rifle and a scope i&#39;ve missed non-moving targets 40yds away.</p>

<p>you saw about 2-3 seconds of action.  of course you&#39;re not going to see blood splatter even if he did happen to hit her during those shots.  have you ever cut yourself by accident, knowing you just got cut, yet it takes a few seconds to bleed?  it happens with sharp knives all the time.  as another poster said the bullets also tend to be very hot at entry and do cauterize the wound temporarily. </p>

<p>pooled blood:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would like to see these things.</p>

<ul>
<li>Dash cam video of the chase</li>
<li>A picture of him in the stretcher with his face not blurred (too many news stories stated he killed himself in his vehicle, while others stated he died in the hospital)</li>
<li>Surveillance video from the airport parking lot where he supposedly switched from his car to a rental car (obvious switch out right here)</li>
</ul>

<p>If anyone could slow the video down and look down to the end of the hallway where the female reporter was running to... There&#39;s a black moving shadow (I know this sounds ridiculous, but I saw it).</p>

<p>I think he flew out at the airport.. why would he go there? Why would his rental car be parked there? Wouldn&#39;t that be an obvious place where he would get caught by the cops after shooting someone?</p>

<p>Very very fishy story... It does not all add up to me. The weird boyfriend tweets, you wouldn&#39;t be tweeting and doing interviews immediately after someone you loved died. The fact that he sent 7 tweets and uploaded videos while driving, the length of the time it actually took for them to find him while the news was reporting that they were tracking his calls.. if they were tracking his calls, couldn&#39;t they find his exact location? Forgive me if I am wrong here.</p>

The still is clearer than any of the news video footage I&#39;ve been able to find and this image CLEARLY shows a WHITE MAN&#39;s HEAD. I even went as far in photoshop of lining up this image with a still image with the black man&#39;s head and the only change when lowering opacity was the head area... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To finally answer your question, OP-- NO, you aren&#39;t the only one who thinks that. But you&#39;re all acting extremely hypocritically in jumping to conclusions based on what evidence has been released in LESS THAN 24 HOURS AFTER THE INCIDENT OCCURRED!! </p>

<p>You (and others in these comments) are the reason why conspiracy theorists have a bad rap and always get laughed at in other subs. To respond to another commenter here who says, &quot;No, this is not an embarrassment to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>&quot;... yes, it absolutely fucking is. Logic CAN exist in this sub. It seems, however, that a majority of participants here are schizophrenic sociopaths who feel the need to always jump the gun and declare EVERY tragedy as a conspiracy. That, in itself, is a tragedy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Time stamps don&#39;t make sense. At 6:10am EST WDBJ tweets: &quot;We love you Alison and Adam.&quot; at 6:34am EST Chris Hurst tweets. &quot;She was the most radiant woman I ever met. And for some reason she loved me back. She loved her family, her parents and her brother.&quot; The shooting doesn&#39;t occur until 6:46 am. 
<a href="http://imgur.com/D8ECYr9">http://imgur.com/D8ECYr9</a></p>

<p>You don&#39;t see much, or any flare from the front of the gun. I&#39;m not saying I&#39;ve shot a gun before, but I would assume to see a few flares from the nose or barrel. Also, no shells are heard falling on the floor or seen ejecting from the side of the chamber. </p>

<p>Alison gets shot about three times before she decides to run, and I don&#39;t know about you, but getting shot three times in the torso would bring me down to my knees or to the ground. Alison manages to run away a couple of feet before the camera pans away to the &quot;killer&quot; as it falls to the ground. </p>

<p>Her screams of pain and terror seem to stay consistent and do not change pitch or alter in resonance as she is being stricken by the supposed rounds. </p>

<p>Now to Bryce Williams GoPro: It goes black right after Alison starts running away. They say how disgusting of him to wait for the camera to pan over to her before he starts shooting, but it just so happens that his GoPro doesn&#39;t catch any of it, and the news just so happens to show enough before cutting out. Something smells fishy.</p>

<p>Let us not forget that Hillary Clinton has been advocating gun control throughout her campaign. Virginia just lost gun control not too long ago. </p>

<p>Does nobody know that Obama and Hillary have the exact same political mentor? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You play too many video games. There is no flash from a handgun like this. They were on a wooden walkway you wouldn&#39;t hear spent casings falling. I believe he missed with the first few shots, it&#39;s not like a game, an actual gun and killing someone is completely different. He paused, he was obviously second guessing his decision and that transferred into not shooting well. He isn&#39;t using a go pro, it&#39;s his cell phone, it goes black because he drops it camera down, thus the audio still going. All them Democrats are advocating for gun control, what does a mentor have to do with anything? I don&#39;t know about the time line, I haven&#39;t looked. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why wouldn&#39;t a Glock 19 have muzzle flash? It shoots a 9mm... you can see it very easily outdoors. A 22 will show flash outdoors as well. Also, a spent casing almost sounds like a coin dropping on wood, on concrete it is a bit different. Do you really even know what you&#39;re talking about? The only reason he paused was to get the camera man to have focus on the the lady doing the interview. </p>

<p>Either way, I&#39;m not sure how I feel on this as a conspiracy or not.</p>

If their plan is to get our guns why didn&#39;t they start when they had 90% support for a federal law?  Maybe because they don&#39;t actually want our guns.. They just want there to be a debate about gun laws so they can fundraise off of the idea.  It works like this every time.  Everyone starts writing checks to the NRA and stocking up on guns and ammo and then no federal laws are passed.  The politicians are all bought.  It doesn&#39;t matter if 90% of America is begging for a law, the NRA pays over 50% of congress to make sure it doesn&#39;t happen.</p>

<p>WTF is the matter with your brain? CNN is propaganda, you know, that thing that they legalized in this country back in 2012.</p>

<p>If they failed at implementing gun control after Sandy Hoax, why would they stop trying?? All of these &#39;shootings&#39; are adding up in the public&#39;s eye. Theyre piling them up so that we are more willing to hand them over. Thats why there are so many shootings lately. Its really not that hard to comprehend. Dont be such a retard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you think it&#39;s more likely that they faked two reporters being shot instead of putting together another &quot;sandy hoax&quot; as you put it? Don&#39;t be such a retard, because if they could do it on such a grand scale then there&#39;d be no reason to &quot;pile them up&quot;, they could achieve the same results in 3 big shootings instead of 6 tiny ones. It&#39;s really not that hard to comprehend that if you can pull of a massive hoax then you wouldn&#39;t pull a tiny hoax to try and achieve the same goal that was intended to be achieved by the first larger hoax.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My friend pointed out that in the POV video, around the 0:16 mark, when the cameraman is facing away from the scene, you can actually see the anchorwoman turn her head and look at the shooter for a brief split second, then turn and face the interviewee again like nothing ever happened. I watched the video frame-by-frame, myself, and, what do you know, it&#39;s plain as day. It happened. Go look. </p>

<p>What&#39;s crazy is that there&#39;s absolutely no reason in the world for her to have committed that action except for the specific purpose of leaving a little hint that the event was faked. It made me think, even in the live footage, there&#39;s no fucking reason in the world for the cameraman to just be aimlessly filming the water when there&#39;s a live interview taking place right next to him. It&#39;s like the only explanation for him even filming that way is to conceal the shooter on the video and explain why nobody saw him.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s something deeper for those of you who aren&#39;t sleeping. I was thinking how freakin&#39; crazy it is that not only did the shooting take place on live TV, but the shooter also came out with his own first-person video of the event, on top of that. I realized: the two separate videos of the event are a clear occult calling card. The live news is the object version and the POV is the subject version. It&#39;s a reference to the coalescence of subject and object, or the opening of the third eye, or illumination. There&#39;s a lot more to it, but I&#39;ll let you guys figure it out depending on where your heads are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If this is true, and the video was indeed edited, then we have a really interesting twist on this that may open up another rabbit hole.</p>

<p>I think the general quality of the video itself should also raise suspicions. Cameras on most phones are HD now, and we could have gotten a much wider, higher-quality view. Instead, it&#39;s a vertical video. <strong>If</strong> it has been edited, then it&#39;s feasible that the original video was widescreen and they tightened it up to make sure we only saw what they wanted us to see.</p>

<p>I know it&#39;s &quot;crazy&quot; for me to still question this, but damnit, we just never see any hard proof. If you had no clue about the video, and I told you some guy walked up to a reporter and fired a bunch of blanks at her, you would not be able to tell the difference.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think no other explanation makes sense at all except that the event was orchestrated. The shooter supposedly had an estranged, bad relationship with the anchorwoman; it makes no sense for any of these things to have occurred legitimately in light of that information. The shooter&#39;s motivation is also said to have been personal; it had nothing to do with the media. What that means is it&#39;s extraordinarily bizarre that he decided to commit this act in broad daylight at a specific time when the victim was doing a live news broadcast - especially considering he also drove the point home even further by filming it himself in first-person. Not to mention that it&#39;s rather suspicious in itself that he just happened to have been able to locate her while she was in the middle of shooting a completely meaningless story, on location, that likely wouldn&#39;t have even taken an hour from setup to cleanup. What are the odds?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t help but stand with you on some of your points. I&#39;m not sure about this whole relationship thing...I thought he was gay and in his 40&#39;s? His time at WDBJ didn&#39;t even overlap with hers, except possibly during an intern gig she had there in 2012. So that part doesn&#39;t make sense.</p>

<p>The whole thing still reeks to me. While the shooting was in public, they knew it would be rather empty at that time of the morning, and as we&#39;ve seen in previous false flags, they always do this in a secluded area they can quickly rope off.</p>

<p>The POV video is what actually raised my suspicions for the first time. I had no reason to think &quot;false flag&quot; until that came up. Here we have a guy who we never see and never talks (whispers only), and has an oddly white hand. Then he draws on two women with apparently NO peripheral vision whatsoever, and then fires the gun directly in line with the camera and not his eyesight. How do we know it was him posting to Twitter this whole time? How do we know he&#39;s the one who faxed in the manifesto? We don&#39;t. Period. If it were a video confessional, ok, I can be swayed. But again, the possibility of this guy being murdered and framed is real. As is the possibility of deaths being faked.</p>

<p>If you knew nothing about the video and I told you some person walked up to a reporter and fired a bunch of blanks at her, you would not be able to tell the difference.</p>

<p>Am I the only one that thinks the Bryce Williams shooting is fake?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why??</p>

<p>•  Because the gunman&#39;s hand is steady as a rock -- not nervous in the slightest.</p>

<p>•  Because the gunman pulls out a gun, points it at a reporter, doesn&#39;t shoot.  Keeps filming.  No one says anything.  And then finally decides to point the gun AGAIN... finally pulling the trigger ??  (Not all that &quot;stealthy&quot;.)</p>

<p>•  Because I see no blood bursting from the reporter as she was shot.</p>

<p>• Because the reporter appears to have been shot at least twice, and yet she starts running.</p>

<p>• Because the both the gunman and the reporter are &quot;white&quot;.  Had either been &quot;black&quot;, it would have turned into some race thing... and &quot;they&quot; want the focus to stay on Gun Control™.</p>

<p>Nah, mate. You&#39;re not the only one ;)</p>

<p>You&#39;ll know it&#39;s fake if the reporter survives, and they start wheeling her out onto the field of football games like a celebrity.  Wait for it.... &quot;I was pro gun rights, but now that 1 person out of 250 million snapped, and used a gun instead of a knife, NOOOOW I see the light!!&quot; ;) ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re a retard if you think that when you shoot a living thing it just falls over immediately and dies.  I have hunted since I was very young, have shot at least 50 deer as well as a bear and hundreds of varmints (coyotes, groundhogs, etc) and turkeys.  Only a handful of times have I shot a deer with a high powered rifle and had it drop where it was standing.  Unless the bullet hits the spinal cord or the brain then the victim has to bleed out from the trauma, which can take anywhere from a few seconds to several hours.  People get shot by handguns all the time and survive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK kid, you obviously have no clue what you are talking about.   No a 9mm will not knock an adult down from pure force.  This is not Hollywood where the bad guy gets shot and flies backwards.   The fbi developed the .40sw because the 9mm didn&#39;t have enough energy to consistently penetrate if the target was wearing multiple layers of clothing.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think no other explanation makes sense at all except that the event was orchestrated. The shooter supposedly had an estranged, bad relationship with the anchorwoman; it makes no sense for any of these things to have occurred legitimately in light of that information. The shooter&#39;s motivation is also said to have been personal; it had nothing to do with the media. What that means is it&#39;s extraordinarily bizarre that he decided to commit this act in broad daylight at a specific time when the victim was doing a live news broadcast - especially considering he also drove the point home even further by filming it himself in first-person. Not to mention that it&#39;s rather suspicious in itself that he just happened to have been able to locate her while she was in the middle of shooting a completely meaningless story, on location, that likely wouldn&#39;t have even taken an hour from setup to cleanup. What are the odds?</p>

<p>This is the EXACT reason why &quot;25k to any parent who provides me with proof that Sandy Hook happened&quot; guy will never get any proof... because it doesn&#39;t matter what &quot;proof&quot; he gets-- it will always be &quot;bullshit fake government-fabricated&quot; proof to him. People who have half a brain realize that he&#39;s not worth the time. He&#39;s fighting a winning battle (in his mind). He can always say, &quot;FAKE!&quot; and nobody can refute that there is a POSSIBILITY that it is fake. As menial as the possibility may be, it is POSSIBLE (technically)...</p>

<p>Name any &quot;accepted&quot; topic. Guess what? There is a theory out there that doubts that topic. This is the reason that we (as humanity) haven&#39;t accepted anything as &quot;law&quot; since the 1800s... everything is a &quot;theory&quot; these days. I&#39;m pretty sure that we (as humanity) decided that the Earth is NOT flat... guess what? Here we are in 2015, and there are still people who are claiming that this &quot;theory&quot; is bullshit, and the Earth is ACTUALLY flat! What in the actual fuck? Sometimes I want to visit you people, and give you a nice slap across the face. But I can&#39;t, because this is the internet, and everyone has a voice. Even those who are clinically insane.</p>
