<p>I challenge you to come up with a country which can be evidenced to be of equal or higher educational capacity than America, which has also succumbed to a CIA-sponsored coup. By all means: prove it, don&#39;t just assert it. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covert_United_States_foreign_regime_change_actions">Here&#39;s a list you can start with</a>. We outperform every one of those countries in educational and scientific aspects, across the board and by an extremely large margin. Not just post-coup either, but pre-coup as well. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not &#39;exceptionalism&#39; to admit that the US is the biggest super power in the globe is it? Why not? Because it&#39;s evidenced to be true. The same is so for this. Edit: Note I&#39;m not claiming we&#39;re <em>the smartest ever</em>. Simply smarter than every country where a CIA-backed coup has happened.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Goalposts. You began your initial comment with &quot;the revolution will be televised&quot;, which seems to me at least (given the context of your comment - go read the parent), to indicate heavily that you&#39;re suggesting the CIA would sponsor a rebellion <em>within the US</em>. That&#39;s what I&#39;m arguing won&#39;t happen.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a big difference from &#39;co-opting domestic political movements&#39;, and a sight-farther than COINTELPRO ever reached. </p>

<p>What bearing does that have on whether or not public opinion and action can be manipulated? Are you honestly trying to imply that because you can submit to authority, and complete a higher education course, that you automatically cannot be coerced? Education has very little to do with being able to critically evaluate the information you&#39;re given, look at how many educated members of society believe in claims made by presidential campaigns. Like it or not, the american people are very gullible as a whole, no matter how much education they&#39;ve received</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Again, what does that matter? All you&#39;re saying is that our economic output is greater than other countries. That would be expected of a populace who can knuckle down and work for another person&#39;s profit when demanded to.</p>

<p>It makes more business sense to keep the american machine running as usual. There is much more profit to be had continuing as usual to justify gambling your time in order to consolidate the power structure a little bit more. It has nothing to do with how educated our populace is, because on average, we aren&#39;t a smart group of people.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not moving any goalposts. You&#39;re making the mistake of assuming that a revolutionary movement would be a widespread phenomenon. In all likelihood it would consist of the futile attempts of disparate sects of people who have had their organizations infiltrated and sterilized.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You honestly believe education equates to a &#39;submission to authority&#39;. That&#39;s the best thing that TPTB could convince you of to keep their status quo. This is a fundamental difference between you and I: You think education is bad. I do not. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Again, what does that matter? All you&#39;re saying is that our economic output is greater than other countries. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I never mentioned economic output, you&#39;re correlating that to education. I admit the correlation is there, obviously, but no, that&#39;s not &#39;all [I&#39;m] saying&#39;: it&#39;s not even at all what I said. The economic output isn&#39;t relevant to this discussion. I&#39;m saying that the average American won&#39;t be swayed by the same tricks that have worked elsewhere for the CIA before, not because they&#39;re wealthier or make more money, but because they&#39;re more educated in nearly every way possible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>on average, we aren&#39;t a smart group of people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh really, compared to who? </p>

<p>This is just rhetoric: On average, we are an averagely-intelligent group of people: That&#39;s what <em>an average is</em>. </p>

<p>When someone says &#39;the average IQ is 110&#39; they&#39;re wrong: The average IQ is 100; that&#39;s what 100 represents. The average. When the whole world gets smarter, the worldwide IQ levels <em>go down</em>. That&#39;s how the Intelligence Quotient works.</p>

<p>Besides, I didn&#39;t say &quot;the average American is smart&quot;. I said &quot;the average American is smarter than the average [Indonesian/Columbian/Guatamalan/etc]&quot;, which is again, provably true. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Fair enough. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;d think if they were so powerful they&#39;d have stopped his first initiative, that whole &#39;civil rights&#39; thing. Again: COINTELPRO never had the reach or ambition that the CIA has had in other countries. Even in the one instance I can point to where a coup was attempted in America - the Business Plot - they failed miserably because of stupid, stupid, stupid mistakes.</p>

<p>I think you&#39;re making the mistake of believing these intelligence agencies are incapable of mistakes because they&#39;re oh-so-smart. Cuba would like a word with you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny right? How literate do you consider <em>yourself</em>? Try reading what the fuck I wrote. </p>

<p>First, &quot;Educated&quot; isn&#39;t the first thing that springs to mind when I think &#39;Guatemala&#39; or &#39;Iraq&#39; or &#39;Iran&#39; either. I&#39;m not comparing America to every country in the world: I&#39;m comparing Americans to the citizens of countries where the CIA has sponsored or backed a coup. </p>

<p>And second, I&#39;m not saying all Americans are fucking <em>smart</em>. I&#39;m saying <em>the average</em> American is a sight more <em>educated</em> than the average Iranian. Please note the use of averages, and please note the fucking difference between &#39;smart&#39; and &#39;educated&#39; as well - I feel it incredibly ironic that I have to point this out to you, considering your comment. </p>

<p>A well educated person can still be incredibly stupid. I can give you plenty of examples of this if you require. Further, many people regarded as &quot;smart&quot; people are <em>not</em> very well educated: again, I can give you plenty of examples as you require.  </p>

<p>&quot;Educated&quot; is the descriptor of someone who&#39;s been subject to <em>education</em>, as in schools and teachers. America has one of the highest rates of education in world history. Leaps and bounds ahead of anyone the CIA has brought a coup against (just to reiterate my point). </p>

<p>&quot;Smart&quot; is the word a person applies to someone when they feel they&#39;ve made an intelligent thought or comment. &quot;Smart&quot; is subjective to the speaker. We can argue about who or what is and is not &#39;smart&#39;, and neither of us could <em>prove it</em>. Republicans and Democrats argue about what the &#39;smart move&#39; is all day long. &quot;Smart&quot; is not a very useful word, except for manipulative purposes. </p>

<p>Still laughing?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the way it has always been.  When you study history,  it is (almost) always the history of the 1%.  We are a herd animal - it&#39;s in our nature. The grievance is not that there is a 1%, but that they have unfairly and unethically hijacked governance to favor and enrich themselves.  Government should exist for the people&#39;s benefits - the wealthy have their own wealth to protect them - the common man only has his unity and recognition of common cause with his fellow man.  We despair at the inequity but what is there to do about it?  Vote, volunteer, Government is only for the people when it is by the people.  Educate yourself about your own representatives and hold them accountable.  And if you don&#39;t like your choices become a representative yourself. It&#39;s the only democratic solution. </p>

Throughout Human History there has always been a &quot;1%&quot; with a disproportionate percentage of the wealth (Kings, Pharaohs and Emperors etc.). That is the part that is human nature . What is so shocking to us today is that the proportion of wealth controlled by the 1% seems to be returning to pre-democratic levels.  That is bad for Democracy and unhealthy for civilized society. </p>
