No one can say for sure what is to come but even in the &quot;best&quot; case scenario that TPTB haven&#39;t planned for or orchestrated this we are still going to experience a meltdown like none other.  The house of cards has to come down, we pulled out all the stops with the 2008 crash to prop it up by printing trillions of dollars and keeping interest rates artificially low.  We have no backup plan, there is no band-aid this time that can stem the bleeding.  If the NWO or any similar group has planned for total control, then amidst the ensuing chaos is when they will implement their plans. </p>

<p>My personal thought is that the emergence of a one world government or some similar type of entity with a new digital currency is what will eventually emerge, all complete with an implantable RFID chip to gain total control over the population.  You know this is the elites&#39; wet dream, and they are waiting for the right crisis  to try to implement it.  In the U.S. take away people&#39;s instant access to grocery stores stocked with food and people will be begging the government to step in and fix their problems.  </p>

<p>I am too.  I think many of us are.  I also think, however, that we may <em>still</em> be pretty far away from &quot;truly awakening&quot;.  I mean I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>As I said <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3i79py/this_is_it/cueqpj7">elsewhere</a>, there are a lot of things I do that can be considered &quot;awake&quot;, and a lot of things I do that could be considered &quot;NOT awake&quot;.</p>

<p>I think <em>many</em> of us are.  I <em>very</em> much don&#39;t think this is enough for any one of us to think that we&#39;re still not trapped in the matrix, so to speak.  It takes a lot more than not being okay with murdering someone to say you&#39;re not in the matrix of illusion on this planet.</p>

You seem to be on a totally different page, and confused, so I&#39;m just pointing out that perhaps it&#39;s unwise to be making judgments about who&#39;s awake and who isn&#39;t when even your judgments about this very comment thread are unreliable.</p>

<p>by the way, I&#39;ve lived homeless for years, I only have a house now by virtue of my exploiting a welfare program on purpose, I&#39;ve never bought a car or gas, I barely spend any money on anything, and I&#39;ve never done my taxes in my life. I&#39;m not sure why you&#39;re accusing me of this or that, but, again, it might be wise to maintain an accurate understanding of how reliable your judgments are, just so you know.</p>

<p>And everything I said is still spot on valid.  Homeless or not, you&#39;re still a LOT more stuck in the matrix than you obviously think.  The more you continue feeling you&#39;re not, the easier it is for those who have control over you.</p>

<p>Hey, thanks for the heads up, teacher! I&#39;m so fortunate you decided to share such a broad sample of useful information I otherwise never could&#39;ve accessed on my own. Everything else you&#39;ve said has been completely on point so far, so I&#39;ll definitely take this one to heart.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You’re working WAY too hard to just come here and be antagonistic.  Maybe it’s because you’re homeless - or were homeless or whatever - and think either life owes you something or are just mad at the world or whatever, but yeah…you started off here getting unnecessarily mad, and haven’t really let up much.</p>

<p>I read the “Oh, really!  My mistake, I guess I should’ve…” in your response, and just stopped right there.  Simply couldn’t continue on.  Too much “I’m pissed at the world and there’s nothing anyone can do about it!” going on in you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>for the record, I totally didn&#39;t &quot;come here&quot; and &quot;be antagonistic&quot; - I just made a completely harmless comment as usual, continued on in conversation to be friendly, and was suddenly bombarded by some wacked out shit about how &quot;awake&quot; you are and what a wise guru you are, out of nowhere. Then when I reacted appropriately, with bewilderment and derision, after being bothered, you proceeded to fault me and act like I just wasn&#39;t good enough to keep up with your high brow conversation, even though your entire approach was completely ridiculous.</p>

<p>I&#39;m still not pissed off, at the world or at you; I&#39;m just clarifying in case there&#39;s any chance you might listen to reason and alter your behavior. I&#39;m gonna go chill out now and not worry about dealing with these types of interactions, because they aren&#39;t my problem. Have a nice day, though, I guess!</p>

<p>I just made a completely harmless comment as usual, continued on in conversation to be friendly, and was suddenly bombarded by some wacked out shit about how &quot;awake&quot; you are and what a wise guru you are, out of nowhere.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Really?  Is that how it came across from your perspective?  Okay.  Very interesting, because it didn&#39;t come across like that from my perspective <em>at all</em>.</p>

<p>I simply made a comment, was <em>not</em> accusing YOU IN PARTICULAR of anything, and you decided to take things <em>real</em> personally and started making belligerent, non sequitired comments left and right.  That&#39;s when I just said &quot;this is <em>really</em> not worth my time&quot;, and simply stopped responding and moved on.</p>

<p>Your interpretation is YOUR interpretation, and most definitely NOT the only one possible.  I made exactly NO comment about how &quot;I&#39;m SO awake&quot;.  You were the one who started antagonistically questioning, and I just let you know that NO ONE is all that awake on this planet.</p>

<p>THAT&#39;S WHY WE&#39;RE HERE.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then when I reacted appropriately, with bewilderment and derision, after being bothered, you proceeded to fault me and act like I just wasn&#39;t good enough to keep up with your high brow conversation, even though your entire approach was completely ridiculous.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re obviously stuck in your own little world and your own little interpretation, and you think that THAT&#39;S the &quot;only&quot; interpretation to have.  I see that.  Well, guess what, crispy?  It&#39;s <em>not</em>.  I don&#39;t even know what you&#39;re talking about with regard to how you interpreted things because that is most definitely NOT how I delivered what I said or even <em>intended</em> to deliver what I said.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m still not pissed off, at the world or at you; I&#39;m just clarifying in case there&#39;s any chance you might listen to reason and alter your behavior. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe - just maybe - it&#39;s actually BOTH people here who might need to alter their behavior.  Not just me, not just you.  The textual form of communication can leave many things to be desired with regard to clarity, and I&#39;m willing simply let this go and, as you said, &quot;chill out now&quot; because it seems apparent that there was some SERIOUS miscommunication that went on here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>dude. It&#39;s right there in the comment thread, which is why I was giving you shit for not just scrolling up and sorting it out. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3i79py/this_is_it/cueqw46?context=3">Here, look at it.</a> In that yellow post of yours, out of <em>nowhere,</em> you suddenly start propagandizing about your own philosophy, about things you said in another post, about how you&#39;re awake in some ways and not awake in other ways, and about how you think I&#39;m still trapped in the matrix. Out of <em>nowhere!</em> The reason I approach you this way is because I totally didn&#39;t ask for any of that information. It didn&#39;t appeal to me, I was already talking about something completely different, and it&#39;s inappropriate to just wave shit in my face like you&#39;re saying something special, because you aren&#39;t.</p>

<p>Even to this very minute, you keep trying to educate me with information you seem to think has some value, like for example: how different perspectives exist! How your behavior in this conversation has a rational explanation! Why we&#39;re here on this earth! How I&#39;m actually stuck in my own little world! Here&#39;s the problem: <em>I don&#39;t care about any of that.</em> None of it means anything to me. You can&#39;t even figure out incredibly basic things, like the things I&#39;m saying now. You are a simpleton. And everything you&#39;re saying just demonstrates that your understanding is poor. So why in the entire world would you be trying to teach me things? It&#39;s absurd!</p>

<p>That&#39;s all, buddy, that&#39;s all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>DUDE.  My comments DO NOT in ANY way whatsoever imply that you are any less awake than me or anyone else.  WTF?  Come on, man.  And thanks for linking to my own comment because I was able to see definitively that you DIDN’T interpret things incorrectly.</p>

<p>Again, that’s simply not what happened.  YOU interpreted it like that and, somehow, took it WAY personally - and it wasn’t being delivered like that at all.  So I simply don’t know what was going on there w/you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The reason I approach you this way is because I totally didn&#39;t ask for any of that information.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Give me a fucking <em>break</em>, dude!  NOBODY is asking for any information here!  We’re fucking COMMUNICATING.  Jesus, that’s what communication entails - people SAYING shit to each other.  Sorry if what I said wasn’t to your “liking”.  WTF?  Wow.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It didn&#39;t appeal to me</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah.  Obviously.  It didn’t “appeal” to you, so you had to go be a fucking asshole and misinterpret everything to boot - because it didn’t “appeal” to you.</p>

<p>Man…Talk about massive misinterpretation and then just running hubristically with it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I was already talking about something completely different, and it&#39;s inappropriate to just wave that shit in my face like you&#39;re saying something special, because you aren&#39;t.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, your interpretation is obviously dealing with some internal shit that YOU’RE dealing with here - no one else.  You’re projecting whatever you’re projecting on to the conversation, and it simply didn’t and DOESN’T apply - so you’re ending up looking like an overreacting asshole as a result here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even to this very minute, you keep trying to educate me with information you seem to think has some value…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sigh.  You know what, man?  I’m done here.  Simply <em>couldn’t</em> even continue on in this past this point here.  You apparently have just WAY too much…”something” (whatever the fuck it is) to have a decent conversation with. </p>

<p>Go ahead and have the last word, buddy.  Enjoy it.  Won&#39;t even bother reading it.  I’m done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not confused as to where he was coming from; I just don&#39;t respect it. I mean, who knows: if the theme had been presented that way, in the context of its relationship to the original subject, maybe I would&#39;ve had something to say about it, or at least appreciated it. Personally, though, when I&#39;m talking about some completely other subject, and some fuckface comes out of nowhere talking about how &quot;awake&quot; he is and how I&#39;m still trapped in the matrix, with no regard to what I was even saying, it really doesn&#39;t do much for me - especially when none of the information he shared had any practical application at all. I&#39;m happy to get into those kinds of subjects, really, but not with some moron in his own personal bubble who wants to pretend he&#39;s the Buddha. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s also relative, as who is and is not &quot;obedient&quot; depends upon the perspective that one has.  Most if not all of us are &quot;obedient&quot; to some extent or another.  I personally fight the power quite a bit.  Haven&#39;t had a tv in over 16 years, haven&#39;t had a job in over 6, have been a conscientious objector and have never participated in the farce called &quot;voting&quot; a day in my life, I try to educate myself as much as possible about all the nefarious things going on in this world, etc, etc.  One can say that I am not &quot;obedient&quot;.  However, I still have a car that has a combustion engine in it, I still buy gas, I still pay taxes that go to fund all the wars of violence and death and aggression across the world.  I imagine I&#39;m most definitely seen as being just as much a sheep in the eyes of TPTB as the next person that <em>is</em> stuck to the MSM lies - &quot;100% stuck in the matrix&quot; - and doesn&#39;t question the world around them.</p>

<p>Seems all of us are at different stages on the spectrum, where some of us think for ourselves as much as possible and don&#39;t do a bad job of it, and others of us don&#39;t think for ourselves too, too much at all and just go with what they&#39;re told.</p>

<p>Where any one of us is ACTUALLY at may be difficult to objectively assess from our <em>own</em> perspective.  I think most of us think we&#39;re one of the &quot;awake&quot; ones.  I think many of us actually <em>aren&#39;t</em>, however.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Legitimate question.  I&#39;ve still managed to make some money through my art.  It&#39;s definitely not a &quot;job&quot; to me since it&#39;s actually what I <em>want</em> to be doing.  I&#39;m essentially getting paid here and there for doing what I do for free anyway.  Before that, I used to have a job that I wouldn&#39;t otherwise have been in if I weren&#39;t getting paid.  THAT was an actual &quot;job&quot; job.</p>

<p>I rarely find actual <em>paying</em> work, however, so the honest truth is that most of my time is <em>not</em> spent &quot;working&quot; per se...like...95% of my time actually.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I don&#39;t live extravagantly, so the little I have has been able to see me through without having to get an actual <em>job</em>...for, like I said above, over 6 years so far and counting.</p>

<p>Jokes aside, you&#39;re right in a way. Money is just a representation of the time and effort of others. The perceived value of money is the ability it has to obtain time and effort, goods and services from others. Without that money has no value. So, to put it succinctly, all human beings that accept a form of money for time and effort, goods and services are <em>the real value</em> behind that money. </p>

<p>We don&#39;t need money to decide to help each other. Tribal living demonstrates this. People give goods and services to each other in such a situation. The reciprocation they receive from doing do is one of the rewards. Moochers end up being eventually excluded from the giving in the future. This is not only the way people lived before money, it&#39;s the way a lot of social animals live. It is theorized that this need to remember identity and a record of behavior is a major driver of the evolution toward an increase in brain size. It&#39;s more natural to us than money and in neighborhoods it often still is practiced to a small degree as gardeners share their produce among other things. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can be prepared for disaster without giving in to panic or fatalism. It is wise to be prepared for normal disasters (earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, etc.) anyway. There is a balance to be struck, and no need for the extremes of throwing everything away to be a prepper on one hand or just doing nothing and trusting that it will be okay on the other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could be a market correction or could be excuse to war.</p>

<p>Remember the economy is a farce controlled by the bankers (they own most of the corp&#39;s also)</p>

<p>Remember these things are planned and executed.  We saw this coming 2 weeks ago.  Its not unexpected to those aware.</p>

<p>It will be used by the ruling elite to usher something in.  War?  More War?  More Socialism?  More Controls?  all the above?</p>

<p>It does show we are on the brink though.  It shows the market is inflated with inflated fiat currency.  </p>

<p>We know the whole thing is a pyramid scam.  Just hold on to your food and guns.....  and don&#39;t tell anyone your next move.</p>

<p>This house of cards could fall soon and when it does the ruler elite will grasp at anything to blame.  Just to try and save their own asses. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My mom has worked as a nurse in a NICU for 35+ years. She can barely fucking move half the time because of the wear and tear it&#39;s taken on her body, her retirement and chance at being able to relax after taking care of those babies for almost four decades is a 401k. It lost 11,000 dollars in one day from this shit. That&#39;s almost a full year of retirement. </p>

<p>So fuck your whole edgelord bullshit of thinking only some fat cat is getting screwed. Fuck anyone who thinks this isn&#39;t terrible and gets off on average people having their entire livelihoods demolished on this shit.</p>

<p>&quot;This Is It&quot;</p>

<p>There&#39;ve been times in my life</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been wonderin&#39; why</p>

<p>Still, somehow I believed we&#39;d always survive</p>

<p>Now, I&#39;m not so sure</p>

<p>You&#39;re waiting here</p>

<p>One good reason to try</p>

<p>But, what more can I say</p>

<p>What&#39;s left to provide</p>

<p>(You think that maybe it&#39;s over)</p>

<p>(Only if you want it to be)</p>

<p>Are you gonna wait for a sign, your miracle</p>

<p>Stand up and fight</p>

<p>(This is it)</p>

<p>Make no mistake where you are</p>

<p>(This is it)</p>

<p>You back&#39;s to the corner</p>

<p>(This is it)</p>

<p>Don&#39;t be a fool anymore</p>

<p>(This is it)</p>

<p>The waiting is over, no, don&#39;t you run</p>

<p>No way to hide</p>

<p>No time for wonderin&#39; why</p>

<p>It&#39;s here, the moment is now, about to decide</p>

<p>Let &#39;em believe</p>

<p>Leave &#39;em behind</p>

<p>But keep me near in your heart</p>

<p>Know whatever you do</p>

<p>I&#39;m here by your side</p>

<p>(You say that maybe it&#39;s over)</p>

<p>(Not if you don&#39;t want it to be)</p>

<p>For once in your life</p>

<p>Here&#39;s your miracle</p>

<p>Stand up and fight</p>

<p>(This is it)</p>

<p>Make no mistake where you are</p>

<p>(This is it)</p>

<p>You&#39;re goin&#39; no further</p>

<p>(This is it)</p>

<p>Until it&#39;s over and done</p>

<p>(No one can tell you what you know)</p>

<p>Whoa-oh-ho, whoa-aaah</p>

<p>(Who makes the choice of how it goes)</p>

<p>It&#39;s not up to me this time</p>

<p>(You know)</p>

<p>Comes a day in every life</p>

<p>(This is it)</p>

<p>Make no mistake where you are</p>

<p>(This is it)</p>

<p>You&#39;re goin&#39; no further</p>

<p>(This is it)</p>

<p>Until it&#39;s over and done</p>

<p>(This is it)</p>

<p>One way or another</p>

<p>(This is it)</p>

<p>(No one can tell what the future holds)</p>

<p>(This is it)</p>

<p>Your back&#39;s to the corner</p>

<p>(This is it)</p>

<p>(You make the choice of how it goes)</p>

<p>(This is it)</p>

<p>The waiting is over</p>

<p>(This is it)</p>

<p>(No one can tell what the future holds)</p>

<p>(This is it)</p>

<p>You&#39;re goin&#39; no further</p>

<p>(This is it)</p>

<p>How old are you?  Surely old enough to see crazy things happen with the market before, right?  For instance, Netflix took a big dip today and it shouldn&#39;t have.  It&#39;s not affected by anything going on in China, the banks or oil prices.  It went down b/c people are emotional, esp with their money involved.  </p>

<p>I just made a completely harmless comment as usual, continued on in conversation to be friendly, and was suddenly bombarded by some wacked out shit about how &quot;awake&quot; you are and what a wise guru you are, out of nowhere.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Really?  Is that how it came across from your perspective?  Okay.  Very interesting, because it didn&#39;t come across like that from my perspective <em>at all</em>.</p>

<p>I simply made a comment, was <em>not</em> accusing YOU IN PARTICULAR of anything, and you decided to take things <em>real</em> personally and started making belligerent, non sequitired comments left and right.  That&#39;s when I just said &quot;this is <em>really</em> not worth my time&quot;, and simply stopped responding and moved on.</p>

<p>Your interpretation is YOUR interpretation, and most definitely NOT the only one possible.  I made exactly NO comment about how &quot;I&#39;m SO awake&quot;.  You were the one who started antagonistically questioning, and I just let you know that NO ONE is all that awake on this planet.</p>

<p>THAT&#39;S WHY WE&#39;RE HERE.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then when I reacted appropriately, with bewilderment and derision, after being bothered, you proceeded to fault me and act like I just wasn&#39;t good enough to keep up with your high brow conversation, even though your entire approach was completely ridiculous.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re obviously stuck in your own little world and your own little interpretation, and you think that THAT&#39;S the &quot;only&quot; interpretation to have.  I see that.  Well, guess what, crispy?  It&#39;s <em>not</em>.  I don&#39;t even know what you&#39;re talking about with regard to how you interpreted things because that is most definitely NOT how I delivered what I said or even <em>intended</em> to deliver what I said.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m still not pissed off, at the world or at you; I&#39;m just clarifying in case there&#39;s any chance you might listen to reason and alter your behavior. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe - just maybe - it&#39;s actually BOTH people here who might need to alter their behavior.  Not just me, not just you.  The textual form of communication can leave many things to be desired with regard to clarity, and I&#39;m willing simply let this go and, as you said, &quot;chill out now&quot; because it seems apparent that there was some SERIOUS miscommunication that went on here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>DUDE.  My comments DO NOT in ANY way whatsoever imply that you are any less awake than me or anyone else.  WTF?  Come on, man.  And thanks for linking to my own comment because I was able to see definitively that you DIDN’T interpret things incorrectly.</p>

<p>Again, that’s simply not what happened.  YOU interpreted it like that and, somehow, took it WAY personally - and it wasn’t being delivered like that at all.  So I simply don’t know what was going on there w/you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The reason I approach you this way is because I totally didn&#39;t ask for any of that information.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Give me a fucking <em>break</em>, dude!  NOBODY is asking for any information here!  We’re fucking COMMUNICATING.  Jesus, that’s what communication entails - people SAYING shit to each other.  Sorry if what I said wasn’t to your “liking”.  WTF?  Wow.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It didn&#39;t appeal to me</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah.  Obviously.  It didn’t “appeal” to you, so you had to go be a fucking asshole and misinterpret everything to boot - because it didn’t “appeal” to you.</p>

<p>Man…Talk about massive misinterpretation and then just running hubristically with it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I was already talking about something completely different, and it&#39;s inappropriate to just wave that shit in my face like you&#39;re saying something special, because you aren&#39;t.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, your interpretation is obviously dealing with some internal shit that YOU’RE dealing with here - no one else.  You’re projecting whatever you’re projecting on to the conversation, and it simply didn’t and DOESN’T apply - so you’re ending up looking like an overreacting asshole as a result here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even to this very minute, you keep trying to educate me with information you seem to think has some value…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sigh.  You know what, man?  I’m done here.  Simply <em>couldn’t</em> even continue on in this past this point here.  You apparently have just WAY too much…”something” (whatever the fuck it is) to have a decent conversation with. </p>

<p>Go ahead and have the last word, buddy.  Enjoy it.  Won&#39;t even bother reading it.  I’m done.</p>
