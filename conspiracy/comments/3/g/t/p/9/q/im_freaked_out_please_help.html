<p>I came across this video on it and it has really freaked me out.</p>

<p>Can someone debunk or back up the claims in it? Especially the last 2 minutes where it contends that one of the victim&#39;s memorial FB pages was created 3 days before Sandy Hook happened and thst  fund raising website was created the day before.</p>

<p>I&#39;m presuming all of this is incorrect or doctored evidence but I have to admit that I am unnerved right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No its not tor, this is the easiest way to get around some of the copyright take downs on youtube. I will still run across them but, if you have a friend in Canada as I do who I converse with over teamspeak. I can constantly link him videos that won&#39;t cross the border. I don&#39;t know why they just won&#39;t. So this was our little fix for each others videos. its the easiest, you can step it up a notch and use a VPN too. This is usually enough though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It works best on youtube, this I forgot to mention. I have yet to find something that will not cross borders changing the dns servers to Iceland. As you can see in my link up higher, i do use the Tokyo university free VPN its new and amazing I suggest you try it. You just find an open one and click on it, super easy to use. My point is we are not the freest country in the world, it seems as though Iceland has us beat in this area. There are literally tons of episodes of things you can find on youtube using these, you wouldn&#39;t find running open dns. My friends come over to watch their favorite Japanamation they can&#39;t get, I&#39;ve also found occasionally I will find something good I will have to download and re-upload to share it. I&#39;m just assuming its probably because its good and there is something in it someone doesn&#39;t want you to see. I&#39;m failing to see why its infringing on any copyrights usually, or my logic. Naturally you would start here, when america goes full retard we will all be doing this and using a VPN. I just focused on DNS because you never have an issue of being blocked out of something, its basically ease of access. Yes the article doesn&#39;t necessarily give you the fresh chowder. So a person just couldn&#39;t assume its because you can set the dns and not worry about anything thing, knowing you will be able to surf with out fail? No he calls me an Idiot, when its he who doesn&#39;t have a clue, but you probably know that because you&#39;re his mom right?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw those that day. One of them we weren&#39;t sure, because you can create a facebook page three days before and then change the name but the dedicated song to the memory of the dead was posted on twitter and linked to a video hosting service and was a song for the kids and had pictures of them and the teachers. That was made three weeks before the incident. Also ann Hadad is Nancy Lanza.   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvkOE_F-mc8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvkOE_F-mc8</a>
The school was closed for two years and Sandy Hook was the new school they had moved the kids to. Check out the internet activity of that school they demolished. two years of no internet activity and then a week before they fired everything back up.</p>
