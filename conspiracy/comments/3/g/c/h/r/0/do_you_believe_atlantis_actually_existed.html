    <div class="md"><p>Okay in my opinion it is more of an ancient civilization we know nothing about. Plato said Atlantis others said Limeria. But we do have records of world wide flooding about 6000 years ago. Atlantis could be 20,000-100,000 years old. Human beings has existed for about 250,000 years in our present evolutionary state.</p>

<p>To put it in perspective have you ever hear of the city with an estimated half million people who lived where St. Louis is now, you know the confluence of the Ohio and the Mississippi rivers? No sign of it. All of the most ancient native sites in America are either destroyed or built directly over. IN my home town a monolithic crescent moon on top of a hill has a giant hotel built over it. It was built in 1886 too. A nice natural foundation? Or destruction of the sacred? Its haunted as fuck too I might add. Or as is the other case here in Arkansas, damned up. They damned all the best rivers flooding the best caves halting archeology and destroying the history even more. I would argue that there are cities yet to be discovered that were destroyed by glacial sliding over north America. I would argue about 12,ooo years ago was the great global melting and flooding. This IMO is why most ancient cites are on the equator or Southern Hemisphere. Where flooding and glacial activity would have been minimal. Geological studies of the valleys above like 35 degrees shows signs of being formed by glaciers. The U shaped bowl valley as opposed to a sheer V shape. All of the European and north American monolithic cities (if they ever existed) were destroyed by glaciers or time. Seeing as many were massive but just built of wood not stone. We know Tarra existed in Ireland. The ancient capital of the Thuadedannan It is but a field today but once was a massive city all built of wood like lord of the rings 2. To say the least as we all should know by now history we are taught is just not correct. It is a biblical history if anything. Atlantis metaphorically or literally probably was a thing. Just think how much lower the ocean was if Europe Russia and North America Are all covered in Ice. (think Japanese, Philippine and Greek Islands). Look up Doggerland. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doggerland">Eh I can Give a link. I guess...</a> It is historical fact. This theory is iron clad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey brother! Well, Newton county has some that escaped being dammed up but they aren&#39;t on maps. You have to know people who know what hole to go in.</p>

<p>I have been in a couple caves that go miles in. MILES. We turned back after like eight hours because the flashlights were running out of batteries. There is a giant lake/sea/ocean under Arkansas. </p>

<p>The caves I&#39;m mainly talking about the White River Valley, but I have no idea how riddled Missouri is. The Mark Twain national forest I&#39;m sure has hidden history. But I have been in and heard stories from around North West area around Eureka Springs. </p>

<p>Before Columbus brought so many diseases there was a huge trade route to get to the Mississippi on the White River. Archaeological evidence suggests that there was more people living along the river 1000 years ago than do now. </p>

<p>This state once had forests so massive with trees the size of redwoods. All gone. </p>

<p>I would suspect there are many monolithic stone circles and altars that were destroyed like the moon i aforementioned.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s very interesting. I was up in Ponca a couple months ago camping, and there were a lot of places that struck me as odd, and if I wasn&#39;t in a group I would&#39;ve wandered around to see what I can find. I have a lot of friends that interested in conspiracies, but I didn&#39;t know Arkansas had this many secrets. I&#39;ve also been interested in the Toltec mounds in Scott, but a friend told me he camped out there and there is a purely evil presence there. May I ask what part of ARkansas you&#39;re in? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah man we really have no idea the secrets. Mena, Clinton&#39;s coke stash, Civil war gold, Fremasons, Albert Pike. Ponce de Lion went crazy looking for the fountain of youth around these parts.  </p>

<p>The mounds fascinate me. Almost as much as the Paris rune stone. Vikings in Arkansas? 
Have you been to lost valley? It&#39;s near where the Elk live in Ponca. The Buffalo is the place to find ancient bits of the once great past of Arkansas. There are spots that are basically natural forts. Impossible to invade valleys. </p>

<p>I&#39;m near, Fayettville. PM me we can start the Arkansas conspiracy organization lol.</p>

<p>Missouri is LOUSY with caves, all across the state. GIANT caves. </p>

<p>Re: the old forests, a colleague has a wall hanging featuring a narrative by a logger who helped clear the old American southern forests from Georgia to Texas, about how the entire area was a giant forest and now it&#39;s all been cut down. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read one of his books. Underworld I think. The book is based on the concept that human civilization goes back a lot further than just Egypt or Sumeria. </p>

<p>Even conventional archaeology is backing him up on this one. Catal Huyuk dates back 7500 years and Gobekli Tepe dates back at least 11,000 years. </p>

<p>The only part where Hancock really diverges from the mainstream is suggesting two things. One, that a lot of these civilizations were coastal and their remains are now underwater due to post-glacial rises in ocean level. Two, that at least some of these civilizations were ancestral to those that came afterward.</p>

<p>The only reason (imo) that these ideas are &quot;controversial&quot; is because of a lack of archaeological evidence to support them. This is understandable because it&#39;s a lot harder to do underwater archaeology.</p>

<p>I&#39;d be willing to bet good money that time will prove Hancock right.</p>

<p>Life could have been seeded here in a complex cold birth through a metier designed to bring bacteria to a planet. Maybe life has been spreading throughout the system starting with mars, then Venus, now Earth. Each ending in a different act of hubris.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe something like it existed. If the modern human mind has been in existence for 250,000 years or so, surely we would have made huge leaps before the most recent 2+ thousand years. I imagine our history as cyclical. Empires rise and fall, populations rise and fall, knowledge and technology rises and falls. All of which reoccurs over thousands of years and the memory of it is lost. For example: Without books/pictures, I cannot speak in a knowledgable manner about my great grandparents lives. It has no meaning or relation to me other than a name. I cannot account for it. This explains how information is lost or changed in only a few generations time. It is completely plausible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I promise you it did, along with civilizations before it. The records exist, the ruins exist. Some of them will be unearthed after large earthquakes like the one geologists now accept will come to the cascade region. <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/the-really-big-one">http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/the-really-big-one</a></p>

<p>When the next very big earthquake hits, the northwest edge of the continent, from California to Canada and the continental shelf to the Cascades, will drop by as much as six feet and rebound thirty to a hundred feet to the west—losing, within minutes, all the elevation and compression it has gained over centuries. Some of that shift will take place beneath the ocean, displacing a colossal quantity of seawater. (Watch what your fingertips do when you flatten your hand.) The water will surge upward into a huge hill, then promptly collapse. One side will rush west, toward Japan. The other side will rush east, in a seven-hundred-mile liquid wall that will reach the Northwest coast, on average, fifteen minutes after the earthquake begins. By the time the shaking has ceased and the tsunami has receded, the region will be unrecognizable. Kenneth Murphy, who directs FEMA’s Region X, the division responsible for Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and Alaska, says, “Our operating assumption is that everything west of Interstate 5 will be toast.”</p>

<p>the documentary you watched is very mystic, implausible and noncredible. The answer concerning a mystic Atlantis is clearly: No. </p>

<p>The more interesting question is, whether Plato&#39;s Atlantis is an invention, or was based on a distorted historical tradition, in which Plato himself believed -- and what was the basis of this distorted historical tradition. </p>

<p>Concerning this question, academics created several hypotheses. You can find them on <a href="http://www.Atlantis-Scout.de/">http://www.Atlantis-Scout.de/</a>
Most favourited is the Minoan civilization as Atlantis.
But there are other, less known opinions, too.</p>
