        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Has anyone noticed the HUGE uptick in absolutely bonkers posts being started lately, and then up voted to an appalling degree?  I am all for letting the mind get pretty far out there with suppositions, but this is just getting ridiculous.  There is a concerted effort to make this subreddit look like a bunch of buffoons so that real information posted here gets dismissed.  I can link to some examples if anyone would like.  Often when i read these ridiculous claims and see the comments supporting it, I just click to a new page because my bullshit alarm goes off and i don&#39;t have time to waste.  I am starting to realize that it is our responsibility as a community to comment on threads like this saying we don&#39;t agree.  It just takes a second, and helps balance the false narrative being pushed here.  We aren&#39;t all nuts, and these days, half the shit getting posted here is damn near provable!  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For anybody who doubts the existence of shills or the existence of shills on Reddit, check out <a href="/r/InternetPR">/r/InternetPR</a>, which is an archive of information on this topic. </p>

<p>It is frequently claimed that no organization would waste money on this subreddit specifically, but very rare to see people seriously make the claim that shills are not on Reddit in general. So, we have a near 100 percent consensus that shills are on Reddit in general (for those who are aware of the information on shills), but not on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> for some reason. </p>

<p>Now that you have perused <a href="/r/InternetPR">/r/InternetPR</a> and have familiarized yourself with the plethora of reports on shills, I will address the claim that they are not here in this sub specifically. Keep in mind that the entire point of hiring shills is to pretend to be real people, meaning all we can do is speculate most of the time, although there have been a few shill whistleblowers.</p>

<p>1) There are so many organizations which hire shills that it makes it more and more likely that shills will end up on specific subreddits.  </p>

<p>2) The top post on this sub has ~90 percent of the views this subreddit receives. This is because the subscribers (325,000 and counting) will see the top post on their main front page. This is in contrast to the amount of people here in this sub (about 500 on average at any one time)</p>

<p>3) It is extremely easy to manipulate votes and avoid detection by the admins.</p>

<p>4) Since most of the views in this sub are concentrated on the top post, you should expect that this top post will be artificially inflated. One easy way to suppress the views of every single post in ths subreddit is to boost a shitpost to the top slot, which frequently occurs. One example was the Beavis and Butthead post from 2 days ago, which was a hoax. </p>

<p>5) A side benefit of boosting shitposts and hoaxes to the top slot would be the constant tarnishing of conspiracy theorists in general. Like I said, there&#39;s so many organizations which could be doing this that it makes it very likely.</p>

<p>6) The comments section of these posts normally debunks the post and this debunking is typically upvoted to the top of the thread. This suggests that the members of this community aren&#39;t the ones upvoting the shitposts. </p>

<p>So, it is reasonable to assume that shills will manipulate votes based on these points. But, what about shills actually posting comments and such in other threads? </p>

<p>1) Shills would likely work in shifts, meaning they may have very little to do at certain times. To justify their paychecks, they may dip into lower-ranking threads to post comments and derail discussion. </p>

<p>2) Posts about specific organizations which stand to lose money may justify paying wages to a shill or two to derail discussion on the products they sell. If several hundred people stop buying GMO&#39;s for life, a company may lose many thousands of dollars per year. To me, this suggests that shills will be in lower-ranking threads if profits are at stake for corporation X,Y, and Z. A side effect of the arguments made in here is that they tend to trickle out into the general reddit community, meaning a corporation will definitely be interested in fighting the problem at its source. (I&#39;ve personally seen copy/pastes or variations of arguments I and others have made in here that have spread like wildfire outside of this sub)</p>

<p>3) Some shills may not be necessarily worried about how many people see the thread. They probably just search Reddit for keywords and find the threads for a quick &quot;debunking.&quot; I&#39;ve seen many accounts of pro-GMO individuals who post literally nothing but pro-GMO stuff across many subreddits. </p>

<p>It&#39;s almost as if, in this forum, to get a conversation going with it&#39;s actual users - you need to [externally] manipulate reddit to make it so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think literal paid shills participate in this subreddit or, at the very least, it is not a fruitful discussion to have.  Here is a post I made a few months ago on the subject in another sub:</p>

<p>A great hindrance to critical discussion and general public respect on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> are the near-routine accusation of &quot;shill&quot; to any dissenting opinion.<br/>
I hope to convince you not only that it should be removed from the banner, but that you should never, ever accuse anyone of being a &quot;shill&quot;.  Let&#39;s get started.</p>

<p>First and foremost, an accusation of &quot;shill&quot; is a fallacious attack on another&#39;s character rather than their argument.  It is choosing to discard an idea <em>rather than entertaining it</em>, empathizing with the misunderstanding, and correcting misconceptions.  It seems unfitting in the spirit of the sub as well as unnecessary given the chosen moderation rules.</p>

<p>Moving along, &quot;Shill&quot; has a variety of definitions, none of which are &quot;person who disagrees with me&quot;. The prevalent definition in conspiracy circles would be &quot;a paid government/corporate agent who attempts to shape public opinion&quot;.  Aside from a hunch that bothering conspiracy theorists in their self-selecting containment zones is an inefficient use of their time, their very purpose is to convince others of the &quot;Official Story&quot;.<br/>
If you believe shills are on the internet, and not entirely useless, you also hypothesis unsuspecting dupes by default.  These people become evangelists in their own right through fear of being ostracized.  These people compromise a the bulk of &quot;shills&quot; encountered in the default subs.  Some even become active proponents of the official story, feeling superior over the &quot;delusional conspiracy theorists&quot; and engaging with them.  In the internet age, they begin to organize. </p>

<p>As any subscriber who bothered to read the sidebar could tell you, there are large groups of hobbyists dedicated to psychological fascism.  They spend their time and get their kicks seeking out, mocking, and belittling people who engage in non-mainstream thought.  These almost compromise the entirety of &quot;shills&quot; found on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and similar websites.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Given the fact that you know full well that your opinions on world events are not the dominant narrative, it shouldn&#39;t be a strange event at all to find someone disagreeing with you.</p>

<p>Given that a shill&#39;s primary objective is to shape public perception, it shouldn&#39;t be strange that the general public holds a different perspective.</p>

<p>Given that there are multiple groups dedicated to poking us with a stick to see if we&#39;ll bare fang, it shouldn&#39;t surprise you that in your self-selected containment zone are the most inflammatory dissenters.</p>

<p>I&#39;d hope we could be above name-calling not only in our comments but on our banners as well. As long as the poster doesn&#39;t break the rules, we should entertain his dissent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With several hundred thousand subscribers I would be shocked if more than 10,000 users post or comment more than 3 times a year.  The bulk of reddit users are Lurkers rather than contributors.</p>

<p>It is only natural that dissenting voices are more common and prominent than users who feel the need to put in writing their agreement.</p>

<p>Anyways, the take-away is that normal users will appear to be &quot;shills&quot; if shills are any good at their job and that this sub is the least productive use of their time.</p>

<p>Also, I just realize I could very well be a shill-shill.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah dude they all laughed when we said the FBI was running drugs to find its operations, when we said the CIA was responsible for several military coups in third-world countries and the subsequent rise of the dictatorships there, when we said there was no way the government didn&#39;t know about 9/11 prior to the attacks, when we said everything we do is being recorded and tracked, when we said Reddit had an ulterior motive when they hired Ellen Pao. Yeah, all of you dumb fucking cunts laughed at us, and guess who was fucking right the entire time?</p>

<p>Do you know why we don&#39;t require as much evidence as you to know something? Because unlike you we actually <em>aren&#39;t</em> complete blithering idiots and we can extrapolate based on multiple sources of knowledge. How do we know the intelligence community has assumed control of national and international politics? Because they have the ability to do so, and there has never been a time in human history when someone had the chance for power but didn&#39;t take it. I don&#39;t need to see a fucking report titled &quot;Internal CIA Personnel Only: Strategies For Global Domination&quot; because I&#39;m not stupid enough to think anything like that would be produced by the most intelligent people on the planet because it&#39;s damning evidence and they know that. You require evidence of these theories that could <em>never</em> be produced by anyone in order to accept them. Snowden? He&#39;s a fluke, they&#39;ll never make that mistake again. They&#39;ll have restructured everything to make it impossible by this point.</p>

<p>I just find it pathetic and laughable that you think we&#39;re all crazy when there is a man named Edward Snowden that proved we&#39;re all right to the entire world and his evidence is publicly available.</p>

I&#39;m specifically talking about the the users here who DO believe in most of if not all the popular theories (9/11 inside job, chem trails, sandy hook etc) who definitely seem to be at least the vocal majority given the shit that is upvoted here. And I&#39;m saying that they believe in some incredibly stupid shit and are usually very arrogant about it. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve never met one conspiracy theorist who hasn&#39;t told me that either I&#39;m afraid of the truth, too stupid for the truth, or a shill. In fact, literally the first reply one of the users here said to me was &quot;shill&quot; lol. This place is just embarrassing. </p>

<p>Also, idk how not accepting theories w/o a shred of evidence or credibility to them and thinking people who do believe in them are silly makes my worldview small. </p>

<p>Not implying that I&#39;m important or &quot;big&quot; in any way, but rational people don&#39;t accept theories that have zero evidence. Look up some articles on why people believe in conspiracy theories, there is some interesting psychological shit going on in their head. Like you&#39;ll notice that most conspiracy theorists don&#39;t just believe in one theory, they accept all of the more popular ones. A majority of the time these people don&#39;t believe in these theories for rational reasons but for emotional ones. <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is not some bastion of free speech, it&#39;s a place for people who have NO IDEA what they are talking about to feel like they freedom fighters.

    <div class="md"><p>one of my friends was deep into it, not sure where exactly he got it but it seemed to be from religious youtube videos - he seemed to buy it wholesale as a matter of biblical literalism, despite me pointing out many of the obvious flaws in the theory both theological and scientific; what got me about it is the videos he was linking to were somewhat compelling on their own but the people who made them obviously knew a considerable amount of history and biblical theory, there were quotes from all sorts of people which you simply couldn&#39;t discover without also learning the counter-arguments and bits of math which although misrepresented could only have come from someone who understands how to misrepresent them...  </p>

<p>there are two causes for a bubble of interest like this, maybe someone big mentioned it and got people on the path, they looked up prior arguments and repackaged them as youtube videos - this seems to be the way with a lot of religious controversies, like when everyone got really excited because ALL old gods were born on dec 25th but then people pointed out that isn&#39;t really the case and it seemed to dismiss the very real fact that the Christmas feast was adopted from older pagan festivals... That was a classic example of the concept from which the film which popularised the overstatement drew it&#39;s name, a zeitgeist is the flavour or the moment, the direction the wind is currently blowing in, events like the sudden awareness of a fact which has been talked about in textbooks near on two thousands years galvanises everyone into addressing the fact and seeing how it affects their worldview -but then the wave breaks upon a rock and that spirit of reformism draws back with the regressive undercurrents always present in any system, this can happen naturally or by design - it could be a rocky shore or a breakwater constructed to ease the erosive force of the tides....  </p>

<p>Imagine if that section of the film had been meticulously researched and every fact was proven with the most irrefutable of sources and citations, that wave of interest might have kept rolling shorewards gathering momentum and pace... maybe people would talk about how &#39;The sign of the cross, represented in its simplest form by a crossing of two lines at right angles, greatly antedates in both the East and West to the introduction of Christianity. It goes back to a very remote period of human civilization&#39; which might lead to a surge in interest in pre-Christian theology and if everyone remembered the old secrets how could a system like capitalism survive? how could rulers sit on their thrones? but it&#39;s not likely to happen, there are bulwarks built up along the shore and break waters stretching far out to sea... </p>

<p>I think these flat-earth type things are sort of like that breakwater, what with the fact it&#39;s now a known fact that a considerable portion of the conspiracy theories from the 90s weren&#39;t just true but considerably worse than even the crackpots imagined I think they wanted to scare people off, reassert that notion that people who believe the governments of the west are corrupt are crazy...  </p>

<p>I thought the same about those videos with the kids claiming to have been Satanically abused which turned out to be lies, such perfect timing to distract from the very real conspiracy of paedophiles that were in fact abusing children in the most horrific ways... It helps muddy the waters and divide people who who might otherwise have worked together on forcing change...  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a theory on the Flat Earth bullshit. I&#39;ve been saying this for a week or so now. There&#39;s more to it though: There&#39;s also the &quot;Nukes don&#39;t exist&quot; bullshit and &quot;Evolution is a scam&quot; bullshit. They all rely on an active denial of science. This is important, especially online. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s all psyops, but they&#39;ve got multiple goals here, not just &#39;associate conspiracy theorists with outrageous theories&#39;. They&#39;re also attempting to derail anyone who has a scientific or rational view on the world into spending their time &#39;debunking&#39; those theories. Arguing with them. Researching their insanity. They know we love to do it. And we&#39;ll waste our time there instead of addressing the actual things changing the world, such as TPP, world banking in general, and the concept of &#39;terrorism&#39;. It&#39;s providing low hanging fruit, so we don&#39;t aim higher.</p>

<p>Tag the users who are pushing it, you will see a few trends: There&#39;s <em>not many</em>. It&#39;s only about 5 or 6 users who ever promote it heavily outside their little sub (edit: yet their posts seem to garner a lot more upvotes than that). These users will almost always dodge questions directly, and further, will assert you yourself are the shill for questioning them at all. </p>

<p>And they act like trolls. On purpose. Why? Again: derailment. That&#39;s the goal of the shill, not necessarily to direct the conversation towards a proper end, but sometimes just to derail the conversation entirely and stop it from happening. In the case of this sub, I think that&#39;d be the express goal.</p>

<p>That&#39;s just one end though. The <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> end. The <a href="/r/christianity">/r/christianity</a> end is the other: They&#39;re active there too. And the sub, <a href="/r/theworldisflat">/r/theworldisflat</a>, is represented by two mods: OurJesuitPaymasters who frequents <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and SquareHimself, who frequents <a href="/r/christianity">/r/christianity</a>. The way that the two groups within the whole act is like night and day. It all serves to keep the insanity angle but at the same time, provide a sense of legitimacy to the &#39;other side&#39; of the conspiracy spectrum: the right wing christians. SquareHimself is polite as fuck; dude is a nice, calm mannered guy. The other is a complete troll who asserts all downvotes come from shills. </p>

<p>In a related note, I&#39;d also love to see the metrics on how often the term &#39;shill&#39; is used, and how it coincides with subscription activity. I&#39;ve been saying this too: Just calling people &#39;shills&#39; is derailment. The answer is to downvote this trash, downvote their responses, don&#39;t engage, and educate those who do about who they&#39;re actually talking to.</p>

<p>They&#39;re either the dumbest people on the planet, bar-none, or they&#39;re intentionally doing this towards the general goal of weakening the various conspiracy movements in any way they can. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I noticed this about 2 or 3 (ish) years ago. When reddit became a &quot;mainstream site&quot; owned by a massive publishing / media company - it suddenly became different.</p>

<p>Suddenly <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> had new mods and an influx of people talking solely and specifically about jews and apologizing for hitler and denying the holocaust, or &quot;trying to revise it&quot; (as if somehow, changing the number of jews who got killed or kidnapped by the nazi government would change history? Or something? Illogical and irrelevant bullshit that paints &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; as insane, nutcase racists or hitler supporters) --- oh, and when you ask those people to defend their views or enter into rational debate with you, they flee from it, or respond with attempts at drawing you into personal attacks and &#39;personalized fighting&#39; and irrelevant <em>tension-creation</em> to *degrade and disrupt communication &#39;among a targeted group&#39;...this subreddit...while deceiving/disinforming/disempowering everything else that is being communicated here, by association.</p>

<p>Suddenly things like holocaust denier author AMAs were being STICKIED in this subreddit by mods. Suddenly there were hitler-apologist documentaries in the sidebar picture / link.</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>JTRIG</li>
</ul>

<p>The scope of the JTRIG&#39;s mission includes using &quot;dirty tricks&quot; to “destroy, deny, degrade [and] disrupt” enemies by “discrediting” them, planting misinformation and shutting down their communications.[2][3] Known as &quot;Effects&quot; operations, the work of JTRIG had become a &quot;major part&quot; of GCHQ&#39;s operations by 2010.</p>

<p>Campaigns operated by JTRIG have broadly fallen into two categories; cyber attacks and propaganda efforts. The propaganda efforts (named &quot;Online Covert Action&quot;[4]) utilize &quot;mass messaging&quot; and the “pushing [of] stories or narratives” [[<strong>like that &#39;all conspiracy theorists are insane, love hitler and are associated with nazi apologists</strong>]] via the medium of Twitter, Flickr, Facebook and YouTube.[2] Online “false flag” operations are also used by JTRIG against targets. JTRIG have also changed photographs on social media sites, as well as emailing and texting work colleagues and neighbours with &quot;unsavory information&quot; about the targeted individual.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(* added the bold text, obviously)</p>

<p>If they&#39;re on the other massive / major social media websites - you can bet they are here. I mentioned JTRIG in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> once and my post got deleted <em>within minutes of posting</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup!  By having a sub called just &#39;conspiracy&#39; it is an open invite to flat earth, reptilian shape shifter, Niburu and other extreme conspiracies.  The real conspiracies are actually far more mundane, things like price fixing from Walmart, Apple products costing a pittance to manufacture yet costing us the earth, immigration unfairness, human rights abuses, banker bonuses, health insurance charges and thousands of other very real conspiracies get ignored.  Basically because they&#39;re a bit boring to read, whereas 9/11 still draws our attention, and the Joooos are all up to no good and eating babies has been a crowd puller for centuries.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course it&#39;s possible, but you&#39;ve made your argument in the least compelling way possible. What exactly is crazy to you? Flat Earthers? UFOlogists? Holocaust deniers? Anti-fluoridation? Anti-vaxxers? HIV deniers? Moon landing deniers? Jade Helm 15? 9-11 truthers? I think ALL of these ideas are insane but I&#39;m sure some subscribers here agree with some and not others. For example, I&#39;m sure there are some people who think the moon landings were faked, but think Flat Earthers are certifiably bonkers. Who &quot;belongs&quot; here, and who doesn&#39;t? Instead of saying you can link to crazy posts that you think don&#39;t belong, why not actually link to them? You might be able to foster a discussion with the people you think are nuts, and perhaps even find out whether or not they&#39;re the dreaded shills conspiracy theorists love to go on and on about.<br/>
Instead, you ask people to trust your &quot;bullshit meter&quot;. Since your first conclusion is that &quot;they&quot; are out to make <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> look goofy (because...reasons?), rather than entertain the notion that a worldwide group of over 300,000 self-styled conspiracy theorists might include a vocal minority of unfathomable nut jobs, I&#39;m inclined to think your bullshit meter could stand to be re-calibrated.<br/>
Conspiracy theorists are pretty good at making themselves look crazy. Especially in large groups. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hear ya. Obviously an individual cop brutalising a citizen is not a conspiracy, but most cases do appear to involve several police officers, whose criminal violence/corruption is then covered-up/ignored by the senior hierarchy of their force. These instances are genuine conspiracy fodder, although it is fairly low-level stuff.</p>

<p>Of course there is a meta-conspiracy as well - why are US police forces so uniformly unaccountable to the citizens (whose taxes pay their salaries)? Why do police force hierarchies apparently engender a divisive &quot;them v us&quot; credo amongst their officers, concerning the public? Why do police forces appear to have a recruitment policy that deliberately selects violent sociopaths of limited intellect to become police officers!? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it can be explained by Dubai being a major hub and airlines care more about maximizing profits than minimizing flight times, <del>or that airlines prefer to fly over the ocean as little as possible</del> (impossible given the Ministro Pistarini to Sydney path). The fun coincidence of how this awkward flight path becomes nearly a straight line on a &quot;UN map&quot; sparks interest.</p>

<p>Another one that behaves similarly is [Auckland to Santa Cruz](I can&#39;t link because the link contains a million parentheses).  These are even closer together than the first match but invariably have layovers north of Santa Cruz, creating a strange path on a globe.  Again, this comes out to a less straight but more reasonable flight path on a &quot;UN map&quot;.</p>

<p>The pattern persists when I&#39;m more selective, choosing the largest airport in the regions (Ministro Pistarini International Airport and Sydney international airport).</p>

<p>Play around with it yourself, the further south your cities are the stranger the flight path is on a globe and more sensible it is on a &quot;UN map&quot;.</p>

<p>Humans can only detect visible lightwaves, which is a very small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Often, however, there is extremely interesting stuff happening at other wavelengths, which we can easily detect with the correct equipment, but need to create colors for to visualize. It doesn&#39;t make the images false, just changes what the colors themselves actually mean. There should be an explanation or footnote with each such image.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This beautiful image of Saturn and its rings <em>looks more like an artist’s creation than a real image</em>, but in fact, the image is a composite (layered image) made from 165 images taken by the wide-angle camera on the Cassini spacecraft over nearly three hours on September 15, 2006.</p>

<p>Again, I find the image intrinsically false, but pasting together 165 images would easily be understandable as an artists rendition, would it not?</p>

<p>It&#39;s a cool picture, but do you really buy this? How do you feel about each image coming from the same craft? Here we see an incredibly flat (from both universal and camera perspectives), horizontally aligned set of saturn&#39;s rings.  Previously they were off-balanced with a moon on no different plane.</p>

<p>I truly find this imagery ridiculous.  Not only in it&#39;s visuals, but it&#39;s composition and source.  The same orbiting craft took (silly) images from remarkably different perspectives including a moon defying proposed  dynamics of the solar system (tendency to disc shape).</p>

<p>I may have to think a while how to better communicate this, but more than anything the composition of the photos are routinely preposterous.  For now I ask you to put yourself in the cameras shoes, so to speak. Consider earths location relative to Saturn and it&#39;s rings compared to the accepted &quot;disk&quot; our solar system is arranged in. This perspective should be impossible, with earth in line with the discs instead of at this extreme angle.</p>

<p>Much of the material in the &#39;flat earth&#39; discussion is really just proofs against the generally accepted spinning globe model, rather than proof of the standard flat earth model.  From what I have seen, neither of them is correct.  The proof against the standard flat earth model for me is long summer days in the Southern &#39;hemisphere&#39; which would require the sun to be visible from a huge distance.  Southern star trails are likely also a problem, but that is much harder to personally verify.</p>

<p>This is the forum of Eric Dubay, one of the most prominent flat earth proponents: <a href="http://ifers.boards.net">http://ifers.boards.net</a>  It is a very interesting place to visit.  I joined and was banned from there for questioning the labeling of another user as a shill and suggesting that dissenting opinions should be addressed with evidence rather than just being banned.  Eric Dubay made this post <a href="http://ifers.boards.net/thread/573/flat-earth-shill-wall-shame?page=1">http://ifers.boards.net/thread/573/flat-earth-shill-wall-shame?page=1</a> where he labels many other people shills.  It has been interesting watching the progress of these back and forth accusations over the past few months.  That place is good for resources on the topic (<a href="http://ifers.boards.net/board/9/reference-materials-ebooks-articles-videos">http://ifers.boards.net/board/9/reference-materials-ebooks-articles-videos</a>), but I would be careful getting involved in conversation there.  </p>

<p>I have been putting it off, but I&#39;m going to have to put the time in to properly examine the concave model (ie its a ball, but we are on the inside rather than the outside).  Thanks to <a href="/u/TrofimLysenko">/u/TrofimLysenko</a> for pointing out the hypocrisy of flat earth proponents who denounce globalists for dismissing flat earth without actually investigating.  The concave model does not have the same Southern problems that the standard flat earth model does.  Light is required to bend in the concave model for it to work (but that is also required in the official globe model).</p>

<p>Man, the negativity in your post</p>

<p>What negativity?</p>

<p>I stated that I have not noticed what OP claims to be happening. There have always been &quot;crazy&quot; posts and &quot;crazy&quot; comments, and a good half of them are intentionally done in an attempt to marginalize <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> , and that is how it has always been.</p>

<p>There was a brief period where people were talking about metal triangles that you sit in that &quot;heal&quot; you or something, and a bunch of other material which I feel is mostly satanist in nature and origin, meant to lead people down a path to destruction.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have made a claim, now you must support it with evidence. Can you please provide some? So far, you are merely presenting a conspiracy theory of your own.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That was not negative, that was a command, a statement, and a question, all plainly stated without hostility of any form.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You should have done so when you posted this, you did not even prepare this post before you submitted it. Please, provide the links.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also not negative, as OP said they would be able to provide links, which if true, means that they were able to do so at the time of posting.</p>

<p>If that is true, it is illogical to believe that they would have the foresight to prepare the necessary links which support their theory, but then only state that they have them and ask if people would like for them to be posted.</p>

<p>The only logical assumptions are that either their claims are not true and they do not have the links as evidence, or they were not prepared when they posted their submission as they mentioned the links yet failed to include them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Duh? Just write a response and be done with it, simple as that.</p>

<p>Alright, the duh was rude, I could have definitely used nicer wording for that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Calling somebody &quot;nuts&quot; is a cheap excuse to dismiss what they have to say.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is just true, what have you to say about that?</p>

<p>I note that all you have done in your response is allege that I am being overly negative, which is untrue, demanded that I consume a caffeinated beverage, and debate with myself in a thinly veiled insult alleging I am argumentative.</p>

<p>I was not argumentative in my initial response, but in this response to you here I am most definitely being argumentative because that is the appropriate response to this situation in which you are forcing me to defend my comment.</p>

<p>I expect better from you <a href="/u/balthanos">/u/balthanos</a> because you just rub me the wrong way all over the place often times, as in my vision of the fence has you sitting on the other side, but I do not wish to label or accuse you of anything, I just question both your reasoning and your motives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, they are different. But there&#39;s nothing wrong with being critical of Jews. For example, Jews control the American media, and they use it to promote multicultural propaganda. They&#39;ve been using the media to brainwash us for decades.

    <div class="md"><p>I hear ya. Obviously an individual cop brutalising a citizen is not a conspiracy, but most cases do appear to involve several police officers, whose criminal violence/corruption is then covered-up/ignored by the senior hierarchy of their force. These instances are genuine conspiracy fodder, although it is fairly low-level stuff.</p>

<p>Of course there is a meta-conspiracy as well - why are US police forces so uniformly unaccountable to the citizens (whose taxes pay their salaries)? Why do police force hierarchies apparently engender a divisive &quot;them v us&quot; credo amongst their officers, concerning the public? Why do police forces appear to have a recruitment policy that deliberately selects violent sociopaths of limited intellect to become police officers!? </p>
