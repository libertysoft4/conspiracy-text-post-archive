I call it a trap because it not only promotes a way of thinking that is incredibly flawed, but contained in that mindset is a mental device that renders your newfound beliefs unfalsifiable. In other words, it is almost impossible to pull out of the dive that is flat earth theory, because once you start, you&#39;ll be surrounded by people demanding that you ignore thousands of years of undeniable scientific evidence in favor of a few youtube videos. When you&#39;re deep into that mindset, <em>no</em> amount of evidence will ever be able to convince you otherwise. And that state is tantamount to delusion.</p>

<p>Heliocentrism and Geocentrism are both theories,  neither are proven nor disproven.  Heliocentrism was chosen as our model 500 years ago for &#39;philosophical&#39; reasons. </p>

<p>In fact,  many experiments done on the matter indicate the <em>earth is not moving</em>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me put a guess out there — just bear with me, for a minute. I would predict that you do not have any formal education in the sciences. If that&#39;s the case, then your &quot;long and hard&quot; search for evidence of heliocentrism was probably <em>neither</em>. In other words, you gave millennia (yes, I do mean millennia) of scientific evidence and a couple conspiracy YouTube videos equal weight. Do you see why that&#39;s a flawed way of thinking? Do you understand why that amounts to delusion?</p>

<p>I&#39;m tired, so I&#39;ll just copy part of my comment from a previous thread.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It would be one thing if there were scientifically literate people within the flat earther community. But there simply aren&#39;t. There is no argument that can&#39;t be disproved with a high school level understanding of science. And there&#39;s no shame in being scientifically illiterate — if science isn&#39;t your thing, it&#39;s not your thing. But there is shame in considering yourself in a position to throw away millennia of evidence. There&#39;s no shame in me not knowing Chinese, but then I, as a non-Chinese speaker, must give up the right to attempt to rewrite the rules of Chinese grammar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The concept is that the earth is flat and the part we know of is disk shaped and inside the north pole there is like a utopian society that looks over us, and then Antarctica surrounds us on all sides and they are both guarded by the military to perpetuate the false belief that we live on a globe.  Part of this concept is that we have never gotten into &quot;orbit&quot; since that wouldn&#39;t make any sense, so we just launch stuff to perpetuate the myth that we live on a globe. Some even go so specific that they describe how cell phone towers could reproduce GPS like features without the existence of satellites.  (I bet that part is probably true...)  </p>

<p>The motivation for perpetuating this myth is that it is easier to subdue a population that thinks they live on an insignificant rock that floats through space, than to subdue a group of beings on a still disk like plane that has a universe that revolves around it.  </p>

<p>The one part of the flat earth theory that trips me out and I haven&#39;t ever heard a good answer for is why the horizon stays at eye level.  I wish someone that wasn&#39;t a flat-earther (or better yet, a convex-earther,) would ELI5.</p>

<p>My humble opinion is that this theory was manufactured as a distraction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The motivation for perpetuating the flat earth myth is that it will all boil down to the fact that in order for there to be a flat disc covered by a impermeable dome with lights in it, containing a light orb making circle paths, surrounded by an ice wall, is that the only way this would be possible as described is a higher power controlling it and having made it.  This is a push for religion, and a a screen that filters out those who are to analytical or educated to be manipulated and controlled in that sense.  It feels like a check at the door for another sect of interpretation.  There will be an organized religion with this as its identifying basis, I guarantee it.</p>

<p>Also,</p>

<p>GPS works in the middle of the ocean and in regions there are no cell sites, like the arctic and deserts.</p>

<p>The horizon would be the same as far as &quot;eye level&quot; with a globe or a flat circular disc.  Being above a basketball ball or a dinner plate (for example) would have nearly indistinguishable identical profiles.  The surface of a ball may curve away from you but its outline remains the same.  As you raise above each model, you would see farther.  The flat model because the distant objects would be more spread out and distinguishable in the distance until you see the edge.  The globe model because you are seeing farther around the globe until you see the farthest edge before it curves away at 90 degrees from your position. Eventually with either shape the horizon would be below eye level if you move far enough away.</p>

<p>The really strange part of most flat earth arguments is pointing to a horizon and saying &quot;Look, its flat, see??&quot;  As I said above, when you&#39;re above a flat circular disc, the edge would appear curved with either model.</p>

<p>Yes I have identified that glaring weakness in the argument.  I just meant I suspect they could recreate navigation in urban areas without satellites.  </p>

<p>The idea isn&#39;t that the earth is a disk, it is that the part &quot;we&quot; are allowed to know about it a disk.  I think part of the theory is that it could keep going beyond that.  </p>

<p>I am beginning to sound like I am defending the theory. I merely wanted to clarify my comments.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Correct. It doesn&#39;t automatically mean the earth is flat, but it means we must revisit certain things we previously and unsuspectingly accepted to be true, including the shape of the earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No you&#39;re just tap dancing. What does map projection have to do with a discussion about shadows of the Earth on the moon? </p>

<p>Map projection is the system of depicting a 3 dimensional surface onto a 2 dimensional map.</p>

<p>I know what you were trying to say in your original post, and I agree with it. You just said it ambiguously. That&#39;s my point.</p>

<p>Do you understand now, or are you going to continue being a contrary jerk?</p>

<p>Edit: For more help: imagine the light source and &quot;screen&quot; rotated at any angle around the sphere--the shadow will always be the same.  I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t word it specifically enough for your satisfaction in my original comment, but this is what I mean.</p>
