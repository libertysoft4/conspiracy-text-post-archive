    <div class="md"><p><strong>Controlled Demolition Took Down WTC 7</strong>: Free fall occurred in Building 7&#39;s collapse for 2.25 seconds. NIST was attempting to cover this up, but a physics teacher called them out at the public draft hearing. Surprisingly, in its final report released in November 2008, NIST finally acknowledged free fall, but dishonestly placed it in bizarre framework that continues to deny its clear significance. This video series was created by the man who forced NIST to admit free fall occurred and displays the brazenness of the NIST WTC7 coverup.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m all open for the whole conspiracy angle on 9-11 but a plane hit the Pentagon.  Hundreds-thousands of people saw a plane flying at the Pentagon.  Plane debris littered the ground in front of the Pentagon (despite what the Loose Change documentary said).  You can google pictures of plane debris at the Pentagon and see pictures.  Also, why the hell wouldn&#39;t they just hit the building with a plane?  That was the plan.  There would be no reason not to hit the building with a plane.  Where do you think this plane that everybody saw flying towards the Pentagon mysteriously disappeared to?  It makes zero sense.  This is one of those theories that makes the entire &quot;conspiracy&quot; angle look like everyone who thinks 9-11 was much more than what the official report said is crazy.  </p>

<p>There is all sorts of debris.  Where the hell do you think the plane that hundreds of witnesses saw flying at the Pentagon vanished to?  You think it pulled up and went off somewhere and safely landed and everybody who was on board is hiding out somewhere pretending to be dead and their families are just keeping quiet about it?  Why wouldn&#39;t they just crash the plane?  3000 Americans died that day but the people on the plane that was supposed to hit the Pentagon couldn&#39;t be killed?  The government was a little too squeamish about those guys dying?  The theory makes no sense at all... it just makes people who believe that look stupid because there is no good answer for any of the questions.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The landing gears being up are what punched that hole out.  That also was an interior wall.. not the entrance.  You see, the plane didn&#39;t have the landing gears down (since they weren&#39;t planning on landing) and the heavy landing gears knocked that hole in the wall... there was a tire right near that hole.  Where the hell do you think the plane went?  It just disappeared into thin air?  Why would they use a missile when they had a perfectly useful hijacked plane to use?  Can you think of even a single reason that would make any sense at all?  Also people literally watched the plane come in and make a banking turn towards the Pentagon and knock over light poles... what do you think happened?  They disappeared the plane and then sent a crew out immediately to knock over some light poles to make it look like a plane hit them and then they planted some plane parts around the Pentagon lawn and planted DNA from the passengers on the scene and then brainwashed hundreds of witnesses to say they saw a plane flying at the Pentagon when really it was a missile?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course they will fall on deaf ears.  Why actually want to know what happened?  It&#39;s much easier to just make up a story and run with it.  A conspiracy could exist that doesn&#39;t involve disappearing a plane like a fuckin David Copperfield show.  A plane hit the Pentagon.  That doesn&#39;t mean that our government wasn&#39;t complicit in the attack happening.  It just means that planes were actually crashed into buildings.  The only 2 options aren&#39;t &quot;the official story&quot; or &quot;no planes hit the pentagon.&quot;  It isn&#39;t a 50/50 situation.  </p>

<p>And no I don&#39;t believe the magic bullet theory.  But that doesn&#39;t mean that I believe every retarded conspiracy theory somebody pulls out of their ass as the alternative.  I look for the most likely one.  </p>

Also, where the fuck is the evidence for a missile?  At least there are pieces of a plane along with the hundreds of eye witnesses.  Not 1 single person saw a missile.  So you are just pulling the &quot;missile&quot; idea out of your ass.  You might as well be saying that an alien spaceship zapped the side of the Pentagon with a laser beam.  There is as much evidence for that as there is for a missile.    Watch the video link I sent you earlier.  It addresses all of your concerns and if you still want to believe it was a missile after that then you are overly-invested in this being your little conspiracy idea and you aren&#39;t actually concerned with the truth so much as you are concerned with wanting to be right.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again you bash without any justification. You turn to these eye witnesses. As.in operation northwoods there are boots on the ground. They have been told what to say.  Then other eye witnesses see a cruise missile with an aluminum shell that mimics a commercial airliner that they see in a flash of the eye.  They see accounts of others saying it was a plane, so it must be a plane huh.  The MSM is controlled by the establishment so nothing ever sees the airwaves that they don&#39;t want you seeing.  Why do you think the government is trying to sensor the internet? So they can control the info you see in tv, newspapers, and now the internet.  If I had all the answers I would be writing a book or something of the sort.  I know the official story is bogus.  We shouldn&#39;t be name calling and blasting one another. There should be another American Revolution ongoing right now.  But there are people that belives everything broadcasted over the airwaves.  Once we realize we are the many and they are the few there might be change but not any sooner.  Good luck in your journey for truth. Open your heart to love not fear.</p>

<p>WTC7 was hit by debris,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>....&quot;but this structural damage did not initiate the collapse.&quot; - NIST</p>

<p>&quot;A separate analysis showed that even without the structural damage due to debris impact, WTC 7 would have collapsed in fires similar to those that occurred on Sept. 11, 2001.&quot; - NIST </p>

<blockquote>
<p>burned for 7 hours, THEN collapsed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;First Interstate Bank and One Meridian Plaza, both
commercial office buildings, had fires that fully
involved entire floors. In both buildings, vertical spread 
of fire was by external flame exposure, breaking
glass windows from the outside and igniting office furnishings
in the floor above. By contrast, the fires in
WTC 7 spread across several floors, but did not involve
an entire floor at any given time. Additionally, in
WTC 7 there was no evidence of floor-to-floor fire spread 
in the photographic and videographic records.
Finally, the combustible load was likely similar in First 
Interstate Bank, One Meridian Plaza, and WTC 7,
with the combustible load in One Meridian Plaza perhaps 
even greater as it was described subjectively as
“heavy.” NIST therefore concluded that the fires in First Interstate Bank and One Meridian Plaza were <strong>at
least as severe, and probably more severe,</strong> than the fires in WTC 7.&quot; - NIST</p>

<p>&quot;The city water main had been cut by the collapse of the two WTC Towers, so the sprinklers in Building 7 did not function for much of the bottom half of the building. <strong>Nevertheless, other tall office buildings have burned for as long or longer in similar fires without collapsing—when sprinklers either did not exist or were not functional.&quot;</strong> - NIST (Shyam Sunder)</p>

<p>Is this a fact for which NIST has evidence?</p>

<p>So now you&#39;re back pedaling away from your &quot;damage being relevant to the collapse theory&quot; now that NIST has proven you wrong. You thought you could attempt to use the damage and long lasting fires as reasoning. I used only quotes from NIST to prove you wrong. And now you&#39;re trying to pretend you were simply just giving the source of the fire. Which would make your comment pointless against the one you replied to. Sorry. No one&#39;s buying that.</p>

<p>Again, is it a FACT (with evidence) that the debris started the fires? </p>

<p>Nope. Still no reason. You just attempted to provide one that NIST disagrees with. I&#39;m just proving you wrong, using NIST. That&#39;s all.</p>

<p>&quot;Debris from the collapse of WTC 1, which was 370 feet to the south, ignited fires on at least 10 floors in the building at its south and west faces. However, only the fires on some of the lower floors—7 through 9 and 11 through 13—burned out of control. These lower-floor fires—which spread and grew because the water supply to the automatic sprinkler system for these floors had failed—were similar to building fires experienced in other tall buildings. The primary and backup water supply to the sprinkler systems for the lower floors relied on the city&#39;s water supply, whose lines were damaged by the collapse of WTC 1 and WTC 2. These uncontrolled lower-floor fires eventually spread to the northeast part of WTC 7, where the building&#39;s collapse began.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;... the NIST investigation of WTC 7 is based on a huge amount of data. These data come from extensive research, interviews, and studies of the building, including audio and video recordings of the collapse. Rigorous, state-of-the-art computer methods were designed to study and model the building&#39;s collapse. These validated computer models produced a collapse sequence that was confirmed by observations of what actually occurred. In addition to using its in-house expertise, NIST relied upon private-sector technical experts; accumulated copious documents, photographs and videos of this disaster; conducted first-person interviews of building occupants and emergency responders; analyzed the evacuation and emergency response operations in and around WTC 7; performed computer simulations of the behavior of WTC 7 on Sept. 11, 2001; and combined the knowledge gained into a probable collapse sequence.&quot;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know their exact evidence of debris-caused-fires.  Does my lack of knowledge mean &quot;they made it all up&quot; ?</p>

<p>NIST in fact states that the found &quot;no evidence&quot; to confirm the possibility. Yet simultaneously state that it is &quot;highly likely.&quot; So no...NIST has &quot;no evidence.&quot; So you can go ahead and acknowledge that this is another unproven theory of theirs, rather than a fact....going forward.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Since fires were observed on the
ground surrounding WTC 7, it is
<strong>possible</strong> that <strong>potential</strong> ignition
sources <strong>might</strong> have entered WTC 7
through openings created in the
south and west face of the building
during the collapses of the towers.
NIST found <strong>no evidence to confirm
this possibility,</strong> but the available data
suggest that this was highly likely.”
NIST NCSTAR 1-9, page 194</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And you can also stop pretending that the damage and the long-lasting fires are relevant going forward. NIST has proven you wrong there as well. </p>

<blockquote>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure it does.  NEAR free-fall, because the huge force from above completely dwarfed the strength of the beams/structure below.  Some of those sources say the force from above was 30x that of the strength below.  And maybe higher as a larger and larger fraction of the building was falling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it doesn&#39;t explain free fall. For one thing the building was made stronger and stronger the further down you went. Each floor was made to hold all of the floors above and then some. And two, even if the force was that great, there is still resistance that should slow the collapse not speed it up. Btw I thought we were talking about wtc 7? Either way it is totally senseless to justify the 2.25 seconds(30~ floors) in wtc 7, or the near free fall speeds of the towers. You would have us believe they were constructed as top heavy buildings... So heavy that they can pummel through every other floor and turn most of the structure into dust. Sorry my friend, not a chance. Just because thinking about big numbers and heavy objects blows you away, it doesn&#39;t make it a legitimate reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>NIST admits 2.25 seconds of actual free fall, that alone shows something isn&#39;t right there should not be any free fall. What we would expect, if somehow the top of the building gained momentum to start falling, we should see things go slower and slower with each floor(resistence) it meets...other than that all 3 buildings fell incredibly close to free fall. It just makes no sense. Also, the pulverized concrete... A huge portion of those towers literally dustified.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most experts don&#39;t give their opinion...you&#39;re referring a small group of government funded experts to a group of independent experts speaking out, many of which have had their careers ruined because of it. Your comparison isn&#39;t very genuine. Stop appealing to authority, the way the towers collapsed and the extent of the damage makes no sense with the laws of physics we currently accept. Experts are one thing, but look at the collapse without bias and try to tell me that it makes any sense that a third or less of the towers, built lighter than the bottom portions, could plow through the larger, more stable, and mostly undamaged building below with such little resistance to allow near free fall acceleration. It makes no sense. Not to mention, when analyzing the collapses, the top portions of the towers seem to destroy themselves almost entirely before the lower portions begin to fall...and again, not only fall, but totally dismember themselves and turn concrete into dust.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would guess that 9/11 is examined as a case in architecture and building construction and civil engineering classes around the world each year.  Such a dramatic event, it would be a natural thing to go through.  Foreign experts, insurance company experts, arson experts, lawyers; tons of people inside and outside govt, inside and outside USA must have looked at this.</p>

<p>Yes, that&#39;s something of an appeal to authority, but it&#39;s relevant to &quot;fell close to free fall just makes no sense&quot; and &quot;makes no sense with the laws of physics we currently accept&quot;.  Well, &quot;makes sense to most experts&quot; refutes those.</p>

<p>Just because you don&#39;t understand or accept that dynamic force can be enormously bigger than static force (30x higher according to some calculations), doesn&#39;t mean it &quot;makes no sense&quot;.</p>

<p>Personally, I don&#39;t recall the &quot;top portions of the towers seem to destroy themselves almost entirely before&quot;.  I recall the top portions of WTC1 and WTC2 seeming to fall sort of intact for a second or two before dust obscured everything.</p>

<p>What&#39;s surprising about enormous heavy building pieces falling 500 or 1000 feet and creating such enormous impact forces that concrete is turned into dust ?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Suppose for arguments sake the top portion of the building gets smaller before the floors below come down.  How is that evidence of demolition (which I assume is what you&#39;re claiming) ?  Suppose fire on lower floors made beams collapse, and structure bent inwards before floors started to fall ?  In fact <a href="http://www.nist.gov/el/disasterstudies/wtc/faqs_wtctowers.cfm">http://www.nist.gov/el/disasterstudies/wtc/faqs_wtctowers.cfm</a> seems to say something similar to this: &quot;... the NIST investigation showed conclusively that the failure of the inwardly bowed perimeter columns initiated collapse and that the occurrence of this inward bowing required the sagging floors to remain connected to the columns and pull the columns inwards.&quot;  I don&#39;t know if this &quot;inwards&quot; is the same as what you&#39;re pointing to, or if it went all the way to the top.</p>

<p>Sounds like the firefighting effort was massive, even involving military helicopters.  And hoses run up 40 stories.  And they still feared the building might collapse.  But they brought the temperatures down and the building stayed up.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.debunking911.com/madrid.htm">http://www.debunking911.com/madrid.htm</a> :</p>

<p>startquote</p>

<p>The Parque Central was a 56 storey government office building in Caracas, Venezuela.
The fire started on the 34th floor and climbed to the 47th floor. That&#39;s not similar
to the WTC 7 because the fires were on the lower levels. The building didn&#39;t have a
tube in a tube design like any of the WTC buildings either.</p>

<p>The single most important difference are in the columns.</p>

<p>The reinforced concrete structure consists of perimeter columns connected by
post-tensioned concrete “macroslabs” that are each 10 feet (3 meters) deep
and above the second–floor mezzanine, the 14th, 26th, 38th, and 49th floors.
There’s no central core.</p>

<p>endquote</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.911myths.com/drg_nist_review_1_1.pdf">http://www.911myths.com/drg_nist_review_1_1.pdf</a> :</p>

<p>startquote</p>

<p>Regarding the Parque Central fire, like the other case studies above, the fire broke out in only a single location, took place in a structure with intact fireproofing, was not as ventilated as the WTC fires were due to aircraft impact, and was fought continuously – in this case, including water drops from above by helicopter, though firefighting was hampered considerably by nonfunctional sprinklers and standpipes.  Additionally, the fact that the building did not collapse can be attributed to its construction, which is primarily reinforced concrete rather than steel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, so you&#39;re conceding the &quot;other buildings burned and didn&#39;t collapse&quot; issue.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.nist.gov/el/disasterstudies/wtc/faqs_wtc7.cfm">http://www.nist.gov/el/disasterstudies/wtc/faqs_wtc7.cfm</a> :</p>

<p>startquote</p>

<p>In the draft WTC 7 report (released Aug. 21, 2008; available at <a href="http://www.nist.gov/el/disasterstudies/wtc/wtc_draftreports.cfm">http://www.nist.gov/el/disasterstudies/wtc/wtc_draftreports.cfm</a>), NIST stated that the north face of the building descended 18 stories (the portion of the collapse visible in the video) in 5.4 seconds, based on video analysis of the building collapse. This time period is 40 percent longer than the 3.9 seconds this process would have taken if the north face of the building had descended solely under free fall conditions. During the public comment period on the draft report, NIST was asked to confirm this time difference and define the reasons for it in greater detail.</p>

<p>To further clarify the descent of the north face, NIST recorded the downward displacement of a point near the center of the roofline from first movement until the north face was no longer visible in the video. Numerical analyses were conducted to calculate the velocity and acceleration of the roofline point from the time-dependent displacement data. The instant at which vertical motion of the roofline first occurred was determined by tracking the numerical value of the brightness of a pixel (a single element in the video image) at the roofline. This pixel became brighter as the roofline began to descend because the color of the pixel started to change from that of the building façade to the lighter color of the sky.</p>

<p>The approach taken by NIST is summarized in NIST NCSTAR Report 1A, Section 3.6, and detailed in NIST NCSTAR Report 1-9, Section 12.5.3.</p>

<p>The analyses of the video (both the estimation of the instant the roofline began to descend and the calculated velocity and acceleration of a point on the roofline) revealed three distinct stages characterizing the 5.4 seconds of collapse:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Stage 1 (0 to 1.75 seconds): acceleration less than that of gravity (i.e., slower than free fall).</p></li>
<li><p>Stage 2 (1.75 to 4.0 seconds): gravitational acceleration (free fall)</p></li>
<li><p>Stage 3 (4.0 to 5.4 seconds): decreased acceleration, again less than that of gravity</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This analysis showed that the 40 percent longer descent time—compared to the 3.9 second free fall time—was due primarily to Stage 1, which corresponded to the buckling of the exterior columns in the lower stories of the north face. During Stage 2, the north face descended essentially in free fall, indicating negligible support from the structure below. This is consistent with the structural analysis model, which showed the exterior columns buckling and losing their capacity to support the loads from the structure above. In Stage 3, the acceleration decreased as the upper portion of the north face encountered increased resistance from the collapsed structure and the debris pile below.</p>

<p>endquote</p>

<p>So, part of the time, pieces (north face) fell at free-fall speed because the structures below them had buckled and offered no or essentially no resistance.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never quite understood why &quot;free-fall&quot; is such an issue.  Buildings are mostly air, in some sense: lots of open air in each floor.  Once motion starts, dynamic forces of falling building are far larger than the static load the lower members were designed to support.  So things fall without getting slowed down much.  Especially in an all-steel building.</p>

<p>This is different from a concrete-core building, where there are solid concrete columns running from bottom to top.  The motion never really gets started, and the concrete offers much more resistance.  Anyway, that&#39;s my casual understanding; I&#39;m no expert.</p>

<p>This is quite wrong, several other buildings were badly damaged or destroyed by the debris.  (Edit: &quot;The collapse of the twin towers destroyed the rest of the complex, and debris from the collapsing towers severely damaged or destroyed more than a dozen other adjacent and nearby structures.&quot; from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collapse_of_the_World_Trade_Center">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collapse_of_the_World_Trade_Center</a> )</p>

<p>I think you are starting to lose it and just throw out as many arguments as you can think of, as quickly as you can.  I think that&#39;s known as a &quot;Gish gallop&quot; ?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>NIST and the experts disagree with your &quot;the entire building wouldn&#39;t of collapsed completely&quot;.  Read <a href="http://www.nist.gov/el/disasterstudies/wtc/faqs_wtctowers.cfm">http://www.nist.gov/el/disasterstudies/wtc/faqs_wtctowers.cfm</a> for their explanation  The fire started the collapse, then dynamic force took over.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty simple: buildings are built to hold the static weight of the upper part of the building, not the dynamic force of that upper part moving downward.  Dynamic force is MUCH larger than static force, so the lower parts don&#39;t slow down the fall by much.  For more explanations of this, see:</p>

<p>startquote</p>

<p>Along with the 110-floor Twin Towers, numerous other buildings at the World Trade Center site were destroyed or badly damaged, including WTC buildings 3 through 7 and St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church.[144] The North Tower, South Tower, the Marriott Hotel (3 WTC), and 7 WTC were completely destroyed. The U.S. Customs House (6 World Trade Center), 4 World Trade Center, 5 World Trade Center, and both pedestrian bridges connecting buildings were severely damaged. The Deutsche Bank Building on 130 Liberty Street was partially damaged and demolished some years later, starting in 2007.[145][146] The two buildings of the World Financial Center also suffered damage.[145]</p>

<p>The Deutsche Bank Building across Liberty Street from the World Trade Center complex was later condemned as uninhabitable because of toxic conditions inside the office tower, and was deconstructed.[147][148] The Borough of Manhattan Community College&#39;s Fiterman Hall at 30 West Broadway was condemned due to extensive damage in the attacks, and is being rebuilt.[149] Other neighboring buildings (including 90 West Street and the Verizon Building) suffered major damage but have been restored.[150] World Financial Center buildings, One Liberty Plaza, the Millenium Hilton, and 90 Church Street had moderate damage and have since been restored.[151] Communications equipment on top of the North Tower was also destroyed, but media stations were quickly able to reroute the signals and resume their broadcasts.[144][152]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, and the twin towers DID withstand the planes crashing into them.  But the crashes tore off fireproofing and started multi-story fires that raged for 50 or 100 minutes.  And the fires brought down the towers.  Similarly, WTC7 burned for 7 hours, and the fire there brought down that building.</p>

<p>As far as I know, no one sampled and tested any &quot;molten metal&quot;, pouring out or pooling or whatever.  There was some &quot;glowing metal&quot; or &quot;glowing stuff&quot; pooling.  I think NIST and others have speculated that stuff pouring or pooling was aluminum, or some combination of all the stuff in the building: aluminum, glass, plastic, etc.</p>

Perhaps others reading along will see who has been providing facts, and who has been just trying to dodge every fact and change to another speculation.

<p>I know that I won&#39;t be able to convince many people.  But I&#39;ll still oppose falsehoods; that&#39;s worth doing.  This kind of directed reasoning or denial of facts is doing harm to our world.  The same behavior is in climate change denial, anti-vaccine, anti-science, religion, etc.  Pick your conclusion and stick to it despite no supporting evidence and lots of contrary evidence.</p>

<p>I think this &quot;debate&quot; has turned into you demanding and me answering, and you going on without ever addressing my answers.  Typical conspiracy-theory behavior.  You have your desired conclusion, and you will speculate and dodge and try to find a hundred ways to justify your conclusion.  Facts don&#39;t really matter; the conclusion is everything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, that&#39;s what I thought you were talking about, the Herrit/Jones thing.  Here are some problems with that:  the samples were collected by civilians elsewhere later, not at the site at the time of the collapse.  So no clear chain of custody or link to the WTC debris.  The samples/dust could be totally unrelated to the WTC debris.  No control samples were collected from elsewhere in Manhattan.  The lab refuses to share the samples with other labs.  Another lab tried to get those samples from Herrit, gave up, used their own samples, and said &quot;no thermite&quot;.  Far from &quot;backed up by independent researchers all over the world&quot;, it&#39;s been replicated and backed by NO one else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From memory, I think this was BBC repeating an erroneous report by Reuters.  Was it about WTC7 or the twin towers ?  I forget.</p>

<p>Edit: here&#39;s one article that mentions it:  <a href="http://debunking911.com/pull.htm">http://debunking911.com/pull.htm</a> :</p>

<p>startquote</p>

<p>With the lack of even the smallest amount of hard evidence supporting their stories, conspiracy theorists have become more desperate to find anything which could be twisted to support them. Case in point: The WTC 7 was seen in the background of a BBC report while the reporter said the building had already collapsed. The story is that the reporters were given a &quot;script&quot; to say and these reporters stupidly read the lines before the building fell. Plain old common sense can dispatch this conspiracy story.</p>

<p>Why do they choose to believe the more unlikely conspiracy story which suggests that at least some reporters of some news organizations were given a script? Especially when, much more logically, miscommunication could easily explain the video.</p>

<p>Why in the WORLD would they need to give the reporters a head&#39;s up??? Why wouldn&#39;t they just blow the building up and let them report the collapse as they would have normally?</p>

<p>What most likely, logically happened: While investigating and updating information on the collapse of the towers, someone at the BBC was given a report/press release that building 7 was going to collapse. [Edit: we now know they were monitoring the news from different outlets and that&#39;s where they learned of building 7.] According to the fire department, by 2:00PM they knew the building would soon collapse. Reporters KNEW this well before the collapse because there are videos of reporters talking about it before it happened. So we KNOW reporters were given information on WTC 7&#39;s imminent demise. We can conclude from this evidence that the fire department relayed information to reporters that the building was going to collapse. By the time the report reached the reporter at the BBC, it may have simply been miscommunicated from &quot;About to collapse&quot; to &quot;Has collapsed&quot;. She even starts out by saying &quot;Details are very, very sketchy&quot;. That alone should put this to rest. She didn&#39;t say &#39;Sketchy&#39;. She didn&#39;t say &#39;very sketchy&#39;. She said &quot;very, very sketchy&quot;.</p>

<p>It wouldn&#39;t be the first time reporters got something so completely wrong. They said it was a small plane at first, remember? They said Kerry choose Gephardt for VP, remember? They told the family members of trapped mine workers that their 13 loved ones were alive, all but one, when it was the other way around. Those are just a few glaring examples. I could go on... Reporters rush to be the first one with the news and often do a poor job of getting the facts straight. History is littered with examples of this. ...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just can&#39;t refute any of my statements about 9/11, can you ?  So every time, you change the subject to something else.</p>

<p>Sure, there always are some people who will profit (monetarily or politically) from war.  Happens all over the world.  I don&#39;t think the Clinton or Obama govts fall in that category.  The Bush administration had a valid reason to attack Afghanistan (9/11), but not to stay there for another 8 years trying to make it into a democracy.  And no valid reason for attacking Iraq.  I think they did both wars for a mixture of ideological and religious and pride reasons: God wanted them to spread democracy to the Mideast, show that Christianity would triumph over Islam, and Saddam was a thorn in the Bush&#39;s side.  And I&#39;m very disappointed that Obama didn&#39;t get us out of both wars much sooner.</p>

<p>None of that proves that 9/11 was a US govt conspiracy, or anything other than an Al Qaeda conspiracy.  There is evidence that Al Qaeda did it, and no evidence that anyone else did it.  Your desire to find the US govt or the other establishment powers guilty of SOMETHING does not make it so in this case.  Give me some solid evidence that US govt did 9/11, and I will be convinced.  But it&#39;s been 14 years now, and the conspiracy theorists have no evidence, just feelings and speculation and innuendo.</p>

<p>I&#39;m inherently sceptical of the people suddenly turning up in 9/11 forums telling everyone to &quot;just move on&quot;. Really? You think we should just forget that the biggest deception in the modern history of mankind happened on our watch, and 3,000 innocents were mass murdered without ever receiving any justice?</p>

<p>We should forget that the American government has both the power and stomach to murder its own people, simply so that it can murder yet more people in the phoney war it starts afterwards?</p>

<p>Wow. OK, then I&#39;m deeply thankful you gave it a chance. Anti-War.Com is usually right on the money, but you should read the RAD document itself if you get a chance. Always remember that the main battleground for deceivers is language itself. A good speaker/writer can make even the most bizarre fiction seem like common sense.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s fair enough, but now that you&#39;ve proven yourself capable of obtaining new opinions, I&#39;d like to encourage you to do some research into the arguments being used by both sides. One side is using evidence-based material and the other isn&#39;t. You will find fitting examples of my earlier claim about the manipulation of language nowhere better than in this 9/11 issue. </p>

<p>For example -- just one of many --  consider that, after 9/11, the government said it was likely a conspiracy of al Qaeda terrorists. It was certainly an ostensibly plausible explanation, because al Qaeda did attack the WTC in 1993. However, they never produced any real evidence that this is what occurred, making it just a theory -- albeit one formed from seemingly logical components.</p>

<p>Now, fast forward a few years and you have a bunch of documentaries being released claiming it was an inside job. Granted, at the time they were released, most of these were speculative themselves, in that they failed to establish a solid link between the government lying about what happened -- which all of them proved -- and the government being responsible -- which none of them proved.</p>

<p>But the central and decisive point is that all of these documentaries focused on the improbability of the official story through nothing other than basic scrutiny of the known facts. In other words, they firmly debunked the government&#39;s theory about an al Qaeda conspiracy.</p>

<p>So strange then, these were precisely the same people which the government encouraged others to label as &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot;. They disproved a conspiracy, so how does that make them conspiracy theorists? Surely it makes them the opposite of conspiracy theorists?</p>

<p>Such is the depth of deceit in our society you see, language itself is moulded around it.</p>

<p>This does not convince me. Again, it&#39;s too messy, too many people would need to know, it would be impossible to cover up. If 911 was an inside job we would have definitive evidence, concrete testimony from demolition riggers, etc. It&#39;s ridiculous to think only fringe theories would exist if it was orchestrated by US leaders. </p>

<p>Absolutely. But I think that makes it a very difficult situation for us in more mainstream forums. They are organised and we are not so organised. When they find people who can refute their generic pop-culture fallacies they tend to isolate and target those people. Here it just manifests itself in downvoting, but on other sites where the mods are less wise to it, people regularly have their accounts banned because they get falsely reported all day by the trolls. In fact, I&#39;m pretty sure the genuine state trolls (as opposed to the cunts just doing it for fun) probably have a macro for most sites generating abuse reports against certain users.</p>

<p>The point I think I&#39;m trying to make here is that, yes, these people are fucking scum, but that seems to be working in their favour because nobody has yet stepped up to stop them. Nobody except us, that is.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s why I like it so much. I argue a lot here -- in fact it&#39;s the main reason I come here -- and I talk a lot of arrogant shit at various people, but rest assured I&#39;m aware that this forum is disproportionately populated by honest and intelligent posters.</p>

<p>Your facts aren&#39;t present in what I consider to be a reputable source, that is why I&#39;m not convinced.

<p>They are obvious and logically present obstacles. Pulling off 911 to the degree generally described by <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> users would require many hundreds of people to be involved in the planning and execution. I am not under the impression that every single one could stay quiet. It would be one of the largest coverups ever on U.S. soil and we all know how difficult it is for the government to keep anything under wraps. It&#39;s not realistic to think that we&#39;d have to rely on such crackpot theories almost 15 years later.</p>

<p>PNAC isn&#39;t a reputable source? That really is a bizarre thing to say. It was a Washington think tank tasked <em>specifically</em> with analysing how America could take advantage of the power vacuum left in the Middle East by the dissolution of the Soviet Union.  What possible influence does something as humanly subjective as &quot;reliability&quot; even have to do with the physical fact that the quote exists? Forgive me, but it sounds as though you are making blind denials, and the grounds you are trying to use is your own personal bias which you are vaguely redefining to mean &quot;reliability&quot;.</p>

<p>If that assessment were untrue, then you would no doubt research the matter yourself and discover the abundance of sources corroborating the existence of both the quote, and the document it came from:-</p>

<p><strong>The passage suggested that the transformation of American armed forces through &quot;new technologies and operational concepts&quot; was likely to be a long one, &quot;absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event – like a new Pearl Harbor.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century#Rebuilding_America.27s_Defenses">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century#Rebuilding_America.27s_Defenses</a></p>

<p><strong>One of the PNAC&#39;s most influential publications was a 90-page report titled Rebuilding America&#39;s Defenses: Strategies, Forces, and Resources For a New Century. Citing the PNAC&#39;s 1997 Statement of Principles, Rebuilding America&#39;s Defenses asserted that the United States should &quot;seek to preserve and extend its position of global leadership&quot; by &quot;maintaining the preeminence of U.S. military forces.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century#Rebuilding_America.27s_Defenses">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century#Rebuilding_America.27s_Defenses</a></p>

<p>But you won&#39;t do that because you&#39;re trying to legitimise your own bias to yourself.</p>

<p>I said I wasn&#39;t going to argue with you, but I feel I have to point out to other people what a complete and utter crock of shit you are talking. You&#39;re just being openly partisan to the point that you steadfastly deny the evidence which disproves you. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I concede I moved from motives to method.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OK, well now we&#39;re getting somewhere. No big deal. Let&#39;s move onto means/method, if that&#39;s what you&#39;d sooner discuss.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They are obvious and logically present obstacles</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But they aren&#39;t anything of the sort. You just literally made them up. Why would a lot of people have to know? Where is your evidence that this is true? Why could Cheney not have put a phone call into Netanyahu and asked him to handle matters? That&#39;s one American who would have known.</p>

<p>Like all faithers, you try to support your own bias with logical &quot;obstacles&quot; which exist nowhere other than your distorted imagination. You guys actually argue against the laws of physics with shit like this. I&#39;ve seen you do it. We&#39;ll start talking about mechanical equilibrium, and you&#39;ll respond with something like: &quot;Well, how did they get the explosives in the building? It would have taken a minimum of 645,923 people.&quot; It&#39;s fucking laughable.</p>

<p>Thanks for that genius with zero credentials in anything relevant. </p>

<p>That&#39;s a whole lot of presumptions friend. You already know this but... The Manhattan Project employed over 100,000 people. Compartmentalization saves the day.</p>

<p>You&#39;re either playing dumb or you&#39;re just dumb. I&#39;m not concerned which one it is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Manhattan project is barely comparable. It didn&#39;t involve attacking fellow Americans, it happened when almost the entire population supported the war, and the internet/camera phones didn&#39;t exist. It also wasn&#39;t a cover up, everyone present knew they were supporting the war effort. Also, everyone knew about the Manhattan project right after the war.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not telling you what is and isn&#39;t truth, I&#39;m expressing my opinion on why I don&#39;t think 911 could have been an inside job. I don&#39;t need to cite credentials because I&#39;m not stating facts, I&#39;m trying to logic through this with you. </p>

<p>Sorry, but that directly contradicts the analysis of the American/Israeli think tank PNAC, who concluded in 2000 that 9/11 was precisely what was necessary to orchestrate the amount of American interventionism the neo-cons wanted in the middle east. </p>

<p>I just finished reading this in full and it is extremely interesting. The mindset of manipulating the world for ones interests is so terrible and deeply unsettling. Thanks for the link. I remain highly skeptical of it&#39;s enacting 911, but it certainly helped accelerate U.S. military interests.</p>

<p>There is all sorts of debris.  Where the hell do you think the plane that hundreds of witnesses saw flying at the Pentagon vanished to?  You think it pulled up and went off somewhere and safely landed and everybody who was on board is hiding out somewhere pretending to be dead and their families are just keeping quiet about it?  Why wouldn&#39;t they just crash the plane?  3000 Americans died that day but the people on the plane that was supposed to hit the Pentagon couldn&#39;t be killed?  The government was a little too squeamish about those guys dying?  The theory makes no sense at all... it just makes people who believe that look stupid because there is no good answer for any of the questions.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it doesn&#39;t explain free fall. For one thing the building was made stronger and stronger the further down you went. Each floor was made to hold all of the floors above and then some. And two, even if the force was that great, there is still resistance that should slow the collapse not speed it up. Btw I thought we were talking about wtc 7? Either way it is totally senseless to justify the 2.25 seconds(30~ floors) in wtc 7, or the near free fall speeds of the towers. You would have us believe they were constructed as top heavy buildings... So heavy that they can pummel through every other floor and turn most of the structure into dust. Sorry my friend, not a chance. Just because thinking about big numbers and heavy objects blows you away, it doesn&#39;t make it a legitimate reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I can see you are far too invested in trying to find the govt guilty of SOMETHING to change your mind.  Perhaps others reading along will see who has been providing facts, and who has been just trying to dodge every fact and change to another speculation.  You&#39;re totally driven by your desired conclusion, and trying to ignore any facts that don&#39;t fit that conclusion, and inventing facts that do support it.</p>

<p>I know that I won&#39;t be able to convince many people.  But I&#39;ll still oppose falsehoods; that&#39;s worth doing.  This kind of directed reasoning or denial of facts is doing harm to our world.  The same behavior is in climate change denial, anti-vaccine, anti-science, religion, etc.  Pick your conclusion and stick to it despite no supporting evidence and lots of contrary evidence.</p>
