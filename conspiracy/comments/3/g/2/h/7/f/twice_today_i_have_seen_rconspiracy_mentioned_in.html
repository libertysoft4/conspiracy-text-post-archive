<p>I like this subreddit, but this is the most circle jerk thing I&#39;ve read since the &quot;In this moment, I am euphoric&quot; quote over on <a href="/r/atheism">/r/atheism</a></p>

<p>Having said that, this thread gave me an idea. </p>

<p>It would serve <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to have a &quot;Called it&quot; feature of some kind. A list of discussions and links from this sub and how they relate to the stories on MSM / default subs.  It could help legitimize this subreddit and attract a wider range of redditors. At least in cases like this where it&#39;s pretty cut and dry no speculation. </p>

<p>Seriously, stop. You don&#39;t attract new readers or a good community to these kind of subreddits when smug assholes go around bombarding you with information overload and calling people &quot;Plebs&quot; </p>

<p>Plebs? Seriously? Man, fuck your attitude. :\  </p>

<p>People like you act like in one day your eyes were opened to everything all at once and suddenly JFK, and Roswell, and 9/11 all fell into perfect place along with the broken inner workings of our capitalist system and how wealth, politics, and religion all serve as methods of control used by an elite minority against the rest of us.</p>

<p>You didn&#39;t. I didn&#39;t. Nobody did. It starts with asking questions and having those little &quot;oh shit&quot; moments that make you read deeper into a subject. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please note that just because there are some legitimate conspiracies discussed here, that does not provide legitimacy for the more absurd stuff here. </p>

<p>For instance, the evidence for Flat Earth Theory is not at all on par with the evidence supporting the idea that politicians manipulate the election system. </p>

<p>This sub is not a single face and a single idea marching along. It is an amalgamation of many <em>opposing views</em>. It is <em>impossible</em> for every theory pushed here to be true, because many are in direct contradiction with each other. </p>

<p>This is true even for a single conspiracy theory: Take JFK for instance. There are at least a dozen, fully-fleshed out theories about how/why/who, and they all only agree on some points, not all of them. You cannot believe every point of &quot;JFK to 9/11: Everything is a Rich Man&#39;s Trick&quot; while at the same time believing every point of &quot;Dark Legacy&quot;, as the theories do not match up. Both assert HW Bush as the guy behind the conspiracy, but both assert totally different trigger-men from totally different locations. One asserts the body of JFK was replaced with a murdered look-alike, the other claims the real body was just mutiliated to cover evidence. </p>

<p>tl;dr: No matter if we&#39;re right once or twice, we still should be taking everything we read here with a big grain of salt.</p>

<p>Edit: My account received heavy downvotes on all comments just a short time after having made this post. A user below, <a href="/u/LaughingAtIdiotz">/u/LaughingAtIdiotz</a>, attempted to derail in exactly the manner I described below:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But the bogus science angle of flat earth, evolution is a lie, nukes are a con: all those serve a double whammy. They&#39;re low hanging fruit for a person otherwise interested in conspiracy, but also of a scientific and reasonable mind, to go and debunk point for point. They serve as easy distractions for those reasonable, intelligent conspiracy theorists, keeping them from applying that reason and intelligence to actual, real conspiracies ongoing in the world. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>After a little spat between that user, the mod, and myself (with the mod being a neutral party), the users comments were deleted (Rule 10, don&#39;t call people a shill, don&#39;t attack the mods of the sub). The user had three comments removed by <a href="/u/SovereignMan">/u/SovereignMan</a>, a mod here. </p>

<p>Twenty minutes later my accounts posts were all downvoted. Five minutes following it happened again, and five minutes following it happened again. I reported the user for vote manipulation to admins, explained what I observed, and the user was shadowbanned within an hour or so. Apparently he wasn&#39;t very good at covering his tracks. But this goes to show the types of theories that illicit that kind of response. </p>

<p>These are the battles going on in this subreddit. Be aware of them.</p>

<p>Yes this gives &quot;fuel&quot; to undermine the whole community, and also ammunition for shills to place disinformation to such end. Yet, once <em>we</em> start censoring, we will be no better than they are. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good on you. </p>

<p>I think the occult/mystery religion angle is a red herring myself, but like many red herrings from TPTB, there&#39;s probably a bit of truth to it.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t really say either way for sure though. We can spend years delving into the occult and symbolism and ritualism, but the fact is, none of that stuff is concrete. When you&#39;re fighting shadows, you don&#39;t spend your time swinging at the most vague apparitions. </p>

<p>You go after the ones you know exist, where they exist. </p>

<p>Today, that&#39;s the Global Intelligence Apparatus: Five Eyes and Beyond. CIA, MI5, NSA, Blackwater and the rest of the little private armies running around the world with corporate sponsorship. These groups have gained power by fear alone. </p>

<p>TPTB knows that Terrorism is a false-threat, and that the world would be happily plodding towards a Utopia right now if we didn&#39;t have a global enemy. We&#39;ve got robot, fully autonomous factories, we&#39;ve got machines that can build homes in a few days. We can <em>print a car.</em> </p>

<p>That Utopia is not conducive to TPTB&#39;s 1% life: If everyone has abundant resources, then wealth loses its distinction. <strong>This is why war exists today</strong>: To milk taxes from the citizens in the form of &#39;defense spending&#39; (on all sides of the various wars) and to keep the excess wealth of the world moving towards the 1%. </p>

<p>We know these people instigate and then fund both sides of a war. They&#39;ve done it for centuries, and it&#39;s been very well documented. While they might have some occult practices buried down there, those, we don&#39;t know, and further can only speculate on why they exist, if they exist at all. That brand of ultra-speculation only serves to keep us from paying attention to the issues at play <em>today.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s censorship to cover graffiti put up in the bathroom wall. That&#39;s about the level I hold many of those theories. </p>

<p>Removing the trash that can be readily dismissed - such as those things which science knows to be true - would only serve to bolster the effect of the discussion regarding more legitimate topics. </p>

<p>Think about this: consider there is a  conspiracy to weaken the conspiracy movement. Very common assertion. Well you can do that by positing outrageous theories alongside legitimate ones. Again, common assertion. </p>

<p>But the bogus science angle of flat earth, evolution is a lie, nukes are a con: all those serve a double whammy. They&#39;re low hanging fruit for a person otherwise interested in conspiracy, but also of a scientific and reasonable mind, to go and debunk point for point. They serve as easy distractions for those reasonable, intelligent conspiracy theorists, keeping them from applying that reason and intelligence to actual, real conspiracies ongoing in the world. And they are ongoing: if you believe any JFK conspiracy, for instance, you know that cover-up continues even today. I for one will be extremely interested in the biographies published after HW finally passes away.</p>

<p>Point is, allowing anyone to say anything - related to conspiracy or not - should not be the platform of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised in the least to hear tomorrow on this subreddit that the sun is really just a giant satellite launched by TPTB to convince us to live half our lives in the dark. Not surprised at all.</p>

<p>Just my opinion though. Lucky for them, I&#39;m not a mod and I doubt the mods think very highly of me anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel you and the Vice Magazine post is a great example.  It should have been very clear from reading the article that it wasn&#39;t real and by putting that on front page it does hurt the credibility of the sub.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ll admit that I&#39;m guilty of lazy upvoting from time to time.  I might upvote that fake voltaire quote because I agree with it, but I know the purpose of it is to discredit and &quot;prove&quot; that we are antisemitic.  I think I even initially upvoted the beavis and butthead post because I like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56u1jQpjpBM&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=21m21s">Mike Judge</a> and think he&#39;s intuitive and discerning and hilarious. Once I opened it and read the article, it was clear that it was misrepresented.</p>

<p>I agree that there should be a process for removal of that sort of joke/disinfo, or at least it should have been tagged.  I think the mods do a good job at curbing brigading and banning trolls.  There&#39;s only so much you can do before you get into a subjective territory that really is a slippery slope.</p>

<p>I think the flat earth stuff DOES detract from the sub, but for the most part the community is good at not upvoting it too much.  I personally disagree with a lot of the theories that end up getting traction.  I&#39;ve never seen what I believe to be a good evidence of actors being used as victims in a high profile terror event.  The youtube videos that get posted here regaarding sandyhook and boston are generally pretty bad and I wish people wouldn&#39;t be so consumed by them.  But that&#39;s not to say they should be banned and removed unless they are PROVEN to be disinfo.</p>

<p>On this sub you are always going to get people willing to buy into any conspiracy theory and won&#39;t discern based on logic- they&#39;re just all in.  You&#39;re going to get shills and useful idiots.  You&#39;re going to get schizophenics and racists and people pretending to be racists.  I think it&#39;s a tricky line for the mods to walk and people who are interested in maintaining any semblance of informative discussion need to do their part.  The other thing we need to be aware of is that there are often witchhunts against the mods which are orchestrated by outside parties and less discerning users.  Any time there is a shift in discouragement strategy here, it will be capitalized on by those who would like to see this place burnt to the ground. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well aware of that subreddit, thank you for bringing it up here. I visit on occasion, but honestly I don&#39;t think it&#39;s as fun or fulfilling to me.</p>

<p>Thing is that I am comfortable here. Check my history: I love to argue and debate, and further, my motives aren&#39;t exactly conducive to <a href="/r/actualconspiracies">/r/actualconspiracies</a>&#39; motives. My motives can be given as such:</p>

<p>&quot;Spread the message of sound logic, reason and equality, and challenge those who would use irrationality, hatred and deception to remove that equality from anyone&quot;.</p>

<p><a href="/r/actualconspiracies">/r/actualconspiracies</a> doesn&#39;t have a racism problem. They don&#39;t have a problem with ignoring science. They don&#39;t have a problem with alleging every other person who disagrees is a shill. Hence, my efforts there aren&#39;t really doing much.</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has those problems. Hence, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is where I spend most of my energy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>See that is just it.  People come here to discuss things from different angles. That requires outside the box thinking.  What you call &quot;ignoring science&quot;, most here would call entertaining ideas without necessarily accepting them.  And if you spend the time here that you claim, you know that the shill accusations are carried out by a small minority.  As far as racism goes, I don&#39;t see racism here.  Maybe you are confusing criticism of Israel with racism.  One could hardly blame you for that since it is an idea that is heavily pushed by those who wish to discourage criticism of Israel.  Beyond them, please show me this rampant racism that you speak of.</p>

<p>Edit: This in no way states that any Israel commentary is racist, but rather that I see antisemitism a lot having literally nothing to do with Zionism or Israel. It&#39;s just &quot;the Jews&quot; or &quot;He&#39;s a Jew&quot;. That type of thing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Just popping in to say you&#39;re right to use an alt. This is my alt for engaging with the more toxic users here, same as you. I won&#39;t even touch this sub on my main. Being followed around in other subreddits by some random child who can&#39;t fathom that they could possibly be out-of-line? No thanks.
Keep up the good fight. These people preach about rights and morality, but they all too often don&#39;t expect to have to follow rules themselves. They act like rules should only bend on their knee, no one elses&#39;.
It&#39;s blatant authoritarianism, but since they don&#39;t have an army or a government, they&#39;re not recognized as such. But I assure you: Give any one of these chumps an army and they&#39;d be just another dictatorship.
And oh: report people like him. His little rant is definitive spam, and it&#39;s also a violation of rule 10. He&#39;s calling you a shill: That&#39;s an attack. The more the mods get those reports, the more likely they&#39;ll do something about it.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Just popping in to say you&#39;re right to use an alt. This is my alt for engaging with the more toxic users here, same as you. I won&#39;t even touch this sub on my main. Being followed around in other subreddits by some random child who can&#39;t fathom that they could possibly be out-of-line? No thanks.
Keep up the good fight. These people preach about rights and morality, but they all too often don&#39;t expect to have to follow rules themselves. They act like rules should only bend on their knee, no one elses&#39;.
It&#39;s blatant authoritarianism, but since they don&#39;t have an army or a government, they&#39;re not recognized as such. But I assure you: Give any one of these chumps an army and they&#39;d be just another dictatorship.
And oh: report people like him. His little rant is definitive spam, and it&#39;s also a violation of rule 10. He&#39;s calling you a shill: That&#39;s an attack. The more the mods get those reports, the more likely they&#39;ll do something about it.&quot;</p>

<p>Along with raging at people and saying &quot;tinfoil hat&quot; over and over.</p>
