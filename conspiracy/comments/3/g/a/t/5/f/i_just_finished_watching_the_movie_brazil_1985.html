    <div class="md"><p>Terry Gilliam designed his nightmarish, Orwellian sci-fi with an appropriately nightmarish twist ending, but studio heads at Universal felt that it tested badly, and insisted on re-editing the initial release to include a happy ending. That thing you&#39;re feeling is called deja vu, but unlike Scott, Gilliam was vehemently opposed to the studio&#39;s sugar-coated ending, and fought hard to have his version - which ends on the realisation that Sam&#39;s (Jonathan Pryce) fantasy of a happily-ever-after is merely a delusion of his catatonic brain - released. He lost the battle on US distribution, but his cut was released for home video and internationally.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is my all time favorite film. Honestly I don&#39;t think it needs a post in r/conspiracy, but it does feature some themes that gravitate towards worrisome political subjects. I&#39;d say watch it and enjoy it for what it is. </p>

<p>Fun Fact: Terry Gilliam said with an infinite budget he&#39;d never be able to recapture this film. It was a creative vision that transcended himself as director.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Low-level bureaucrat Sam Lowry (Jonathan Pryce) escapes the monotony of his day-to-day life through a recurring daydream of himself as a virtuous hero saving a beautiful damsel. Investigating a case that led to the wrongful arrest and eventual death of an innocent man instead of wanted terrorist Harry Tuttle (Robert De Niro), he meets the woman from his daydream (Kim Greist), and in trying to help her gets caught in a web of mistaken identities, mindless bureaucracy and lies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is hard to give a real synopsis without spoiling the movie, it is much better to go into it knowing as little as possible other than it is a great movie. It is more than a little weird, and most explanations will fall flat of translating the experience of watching it. The ideas in it aren&#39;t really new at this point, they&#39;ve been explored in many ways by now but this is certainly a unique presentation of them for sure. I do like the opening explanation from this essay on the movie. The rest of the essay is one of the best write ups on it I have seen, but should be read after watching.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The movie is set in a fictional world that seems to be inspired by George Orwell’s 1984. It is a jumble of soulless concrete towers, whose inhabitants dress in 1940’s fashions, ruled over by a “Ministry of Information”, a ruthless organization that does not seem to promote any kind of ideology, other than unquestioning obedience to itself. As the name implies, the Ministry is obsessed with possessing information about everyone and everything, and employs a massive centralized bureaucracy to manage its never-ending tsunami of paperwork.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That doesn&#39;t make sense unless someone knows what you&#39;re talking about.... you aren&#39;t dangling a carrot. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Makes me wonder if you were posting on mobile and can&#39;t read before you post.</p>

<p>If someone googles it? They probably won&#39;t have to watch the movie, right?</p>

<p>It&#39;s like saying someone going to fight club and they ask &quot;what&#39;s Rule #1?&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The first rule of Fight Club is: You do not talk about Fight Club.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But you broke that rule. </p>

<p>If it is that epic of a movie? Let people who have it on their list watch it without coming up later and saying &quot;I watched it and I will prove it by throwing out a phrase that only someone who watched it will understand&quot;</p>

<p>Nothing you posted was a mystery prompt that made me want to watch it more. I googled and honestly want to avoid it more because I got more 1 star ratings and more spoilers and there is nothing in the quotes that make this seem interesting.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That is your receipt for your husband... and this is my receipt for your receipt.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Awesome. Thanks for letting me get curious and apparently there is is a bunch of nonsense sucked into this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Buttle? Tuttle?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I honestly don&#39;t care at this point. I&#39;ve read enough to focus on my life and not deal with y&#39;all&#39;s soap opera.</p>

<p>Thanks. I&#39;m not going to bother.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll skip this movie. Thank you. Enjoy your carrot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Terry Gilliam designed his nightmarish, Orwellian sci-fi with an appropriately nightmarish twist ending, but studio heads at Universal felt that it tested badly, and insisted on re-editing the initial release to include a happy ending. That thing you&#39;re feeling is called deja vu, but unlike Scott, Gilliam was vehemently opposed to the studio&#39;s sugar-coated ending, and fought hard to have his version - which ends on the realisation that Sam&#39;s (Jonathan Pryce) fantasy of a happily-ever-after is merely a delusion of his catatonic brain - released. He lost the battle on US distribution, but his cut was released for home video and internationally.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s nothing about Brazil in it besides the soundtrack. As for the story, it&#39;s some sort of critic on excessive bureaucracy and technology in modernization, portrayed through a dystopian future. There&#39;s much more to it though, not an easy film to grasp.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting.</p>

<p>I think that this movie may have been financed in part by the Big Israeli Arms Dealer himself, Arnon Milchan. </p>

<p>I remember Gilliam telling about how the arms industry would court him and how he went to an arms convention during the filming of Brazil.</p>
