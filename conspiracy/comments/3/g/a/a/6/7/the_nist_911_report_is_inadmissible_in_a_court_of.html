<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/281a">The National Institute of Standards and Technology, on its own initiative but only after consultation with local authorities, may initiate and conduct investigations to determine the causes of structural failures in structures which are used or occupied by the general public. No part of any report resulting from such investigation, or from an investigation under the National Construction Safety Team Act [15 U.S.C. 7301 et seq.], shall be admitted as evidence or used in any suit or action for damages arising out of any matter mentioned in such report.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p>Under the standards established by the United States Supreme Court in <strong>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceutical, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 113 S. Ct. 2786, 125 L. Ed 2d 469 (1993)</strong> and its progeny, expert testimony offered to support the official theory and hypotheses concerning the cause of the destruction of World Trade Center Buildings 1, 2 and 7 (the WTC) on September 11, 2001 <strong>would probably be excluded from admission into evidence by an impartial judge in a civil or criminal proceeding</strong></p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daubert_Standard">The Daubert standard provides a rule of evidence regarding the admissibility of expert witnesses&#39; testimony during United States federal legal proceedings. Pursuant to this standard, a party may raise a Daubert motion, which is a special case of motion in limine raised before or during trial to exclude the presentation of unqualified evidence to the jury. The Daubert trilogy refers to the three United States Supreme Court cases that articulated the Daubert standard</a></p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p>Under Daubert and FRE 702, when carrying out evidentiary gate-keeping duties under the Federal Rules of Evidence, <strong>judges must at a minimum inquire into:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>1</strong> <strong>Whether the opinion or theory is susceptible to testing and has been subjected to such testing</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>NIST fail - their theory is unproven and untested, there own testing, in particular, the material and fire tests conducted by NIST, <strong>did not support its initial findings</strong> They did not look for evidence of explosives, contrary to NFPA guidelines.</p>

<p>More importantly, any actual relevant sections of the official report <a href="http://cryptome.org/nist070709.pdf">are classified for public safety</a>, they will not even release them to a <a href="http://cryptome.org/wtc-nist-wtc7-no.pdf">licensed NYC architect in regards a FOIA request</a></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>2</strong> <strong>Whether the opinion/theory has been subjected to peer-review and publication</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The NIST report is not peer reviewed, it was and still is, self published and thus has zero credibility. In academia, peer review is used to determine an academic paper&#39;s suitability for publication.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>3</strong> <strong>Whether there is a known or potential rate of error associated with the methodology used and whether there are standards controlling the techniques’ operation</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>rate of error is 100%.</strong> That is, the previous rate of success in collapsing two 110-story steel skyscrapers such as WTC 1 and 2, by a fire ignited by jet fuel (even taking into account aircraft impact damage) and one 47 story steel skyscraper such as WTC 7 (which had no aircraft impact damage) <strong>is 0%.</strong> The official explanation of the destruction of these three buildings on September 11, 2001 assumes unprecedented processes and events in all three cases.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>4</strong> <strong>Whether the opinion/theory has been scrutinized and generally accepted by the scientific community.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>There is no general acceptance of the United States Government conspiracy theory in the scientific community. The official theory has been rejected by many qualified experts who have reviewed and scrutinized the NIST reports and the data that NIST has made available.</p>

<p>*There are additional factors considered by courts, but all four main Daubert factors are applicable to all cases generally (where the Federal Rules of Evidence apply or where the state courts have adopted the Daubert or similar test)</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>NIST&#39;s specific objectives were:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Determine why and how WTC 1 and WTC 2 collapsed following the initial impacts of the aircraft and why and how WTC 7 collapsed;</li>
<li>Determine why the injuries and fatalities were so high or low depending on location, including all technical aspects of fire protection, occupant behavior, evacuation, and emergency response;</li>
<li>Determine what procedures and practices were used in the design, construction, </li>
<li>Identify, as specifically as possible, areas in current building and fire codes, standards, and practices that warrant revision.</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)  an agency of the U.S. Department of <strong>Commerce</strong> failed on every single one of these objectives</p>

NIST was attempting to cover this up, but a physics teacher called them out at the public draft hearing.

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, a topic shift. Either that, or you don&#39;t even understand my comment. But OK, let&#39;s shift. Go ahead and use the official story to account for the incredible VOC spikes. I&#39;ll wait....</p>

<p><a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10669-008-9182-4">http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10669-008-9182-4</a></p>

<p>&quot;The occurrence of such extreme, sharp spikes in VOCs in air at GZ indicate something other than the behavior of a typical structure fire. Oxygen influx as a result of shifting of materials within the pile might have created an increase in combustion of material in localized areas. But these spikes in VOCs, at levels thousands of times higher than seen in other structure fires, suggest extremely violent but short-lived fire events. Probably the most striking spike in toxic air emissions, found in EPA monitoring data, occurred on 9th February, 2002. Note (Table 1 ) that this was nearly 5 months after 9/11, and after nearly all the debris had been cleared from GZ. In fact, the levels of some species, like toluene and styrene, were some of the highest observed at the site. But the levels of benzene and propylene detected on that day were far above previous measurements, at 610,000 and 990,000 ppb, respectively. Other VOCs were measured at their peak levels on this date, including 1,3-butadiene at 400,000 ppb.&quot; &quot;EPA also monitored very fine particulate matter (PM) and other sizes of PM. PM is probably the most reliable indicator for the activity of structure fires, as such fires are generally known to burn incompletely, and produce PM that drifts up and outward from the source. EPA data from the West Broadway sampling site, the location closest to GZ where PM was monitored, show the following trend in very fine PM (PM 2.5 , or all particles \ 2.5 l m) in October and November 2001 (Fig. 4 ). These data show that the peaks in levels of very fine PM near GZ correspond to different dates than the peaks for the previously discussed combustion products. The five stron- gest peaks in PM 2.5 levels are centered on 23th, 26th September, and 3rd, 10th, 20th October, closer in time to the events of 9/11. None of these dates correspond to the dates of five peaks in VOCs noted above. Additionally, it is clear that the levels of PM 2.5 emissions rose more gradu- ally, and died down more gradually, indicating slower fire dynamics as might be expected from the burning of the organic materials previously thought to exist in the WTC. These data suggest that the greatest level of fire activity, associated solely with the typical fuel sources expected in the WTC, was completed by the third week of October. That is, the materials expected to burn (incompletely) in a structure fire, producing PM, were largely burned off by mid- to late-October. Therefore, the extreme spikes in air concentrations of the five VOCs noted above, particularly on 3rd, 8th November, and 9th February, point not to other sources of typical combustible materials but to other forms of com- bustion. Such forms of combustion appear to be violent and short-lived, and thus similar to the effects of energetic materials, like thermite&quot;</p>

<p>For you need to explain how &quot;nanothermite&quot; caused this:</p>

<p>Indeed, has this behavior been demonstrated as present in any other controlled demolition? If not, then it isn&#39;t consistent with that either. </p>

<p>We will probably <em>never</em> know the specific details behind every detail of the collapse: it was the product of a set of unique circumstances, which had never happened before (and, hopefully, never will again). Analysis, simulation and explanation for such events is close to impossible. Pointing out flaws in the &quot;official version&quot; is thus just about pointless, unless you can come up with one <strong>that explains all the observable facts better</strong>. That&#39;s the area at which the 9/11 truth movement has singularly failed - and 96% of architects appear to agree.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For you need to explain how &quot;nanothermite&quot; caused this:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You need to explain how fire did it. If you&#39;re attempting to claim that thermite / ate cannot.</p>

<p>&quot;The presence of thermitic materials explains why the fires lasted for so many months, deep within the oxygen-poor pile, and why the fires were resistant to the extensive, but ineffective, efforts to extinguish them.  In this scenario, the extreme levels of VOCs would be the result of the <strong>complete thermal degradation</strong> of all plastic materials in the thermitic (incendiary) fires.  In <strong>normal structural fires</strong> with limited ventilation, <strong>plastic materials often burn incompletely.&quot;</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Indeed, has this behavior been demonstrated as present in any other controlled demolition? If not, then it isn&#39;t consistent with that either.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can you point to another known demo using thermite? No. Can we point to other known fires? Yep.</p>

<p>The Plastimet plastic factory burned 400 tons of plastic for three days. The max readout for benzene was 26 ppb. You need to account for 610.000 ppb benzene. Not to mention 990.000 ppb propylene.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since when does jet fuel count as &quot;typical combustible materials&quot;? It clearly refers to &quot;the organic materials previously thought to exist in the WTC&quot;. Which would not include jet fuel.</p>

<p>Man, you really can&#39;t read, can you?</p>

<p>And, sorry, you don&#39;t get to demand I answer all your questions, while refusing to answer any of mine. That isn&#39;t how debate, or even polite conversation works. But why I am unsurprised you are apparently not interested in either?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s have your better theory. Put up or shut up time. Which is it?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll keep waiting for an answer I suppose....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well you are done. Because you can&#39;t account for the VOCs. Neither could the official story. Nice failure. Jet fuel was debunked by the original paper I linked. </p>

<p>:( </p>

<p>You might want to read your own sources. Especially when you don&#39;t read mine (or the NIST/FEMA reports) </p>

<p>You don&#39;t get to push the official story while simultaneously making claims that the official story disagrees with. Not too confident in their story I guess? Well, that&#39;s a start!</p>

<p>I&#39;ll keep waiting for one of you faithers to find the answer. So far...0.00%</p>
