<p>Why do you think I am here to disrupt?  Is it because questioning the shape of the earth is so ridiculous that I must be?  Have you actually looked for yourself at the arguments being made on the topic.</p>

<p>As I&#39;ve stated previously, the standard flat earth model being proposed doesn&#39;t work.  But the topic does pose some problems with the official spinning globe model.</p>

<p>Perhaps you should branch out a little bit from 9/11, there is a lot more going on out there.  9/11 is just a small piece of a much larger picture.  Investigating NASA is a prerequisite to thinking about the shape of the earth.  If you believe them, then obviously we are on a spinning globe.</p>

<p>Let me ask you, do you believe that NASA engages in fraud or do you believe the material they produce to be genuine?  Do you think man has landed on the moon?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We could discuss the topic of the shape of the earth specifically, but I don&#39;t think you are in a place where you can consider actual arguments.  You made this statement in your new thread:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No verifiable facts are ever reported.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is just patently untrue.  There are actually a huge number of points to consider on the topic.  Try thinking about it this way:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.  - Aristotle</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You don&#39;t have to get so mad and defensive just because someone is bringing up a topic to discuss it.  The only thing to fear is that your own mind might get changed.  The real topic we are discussing here is human psychology.  People resist looking at things because they don&#39;t want their world view to change.  You can see this with 9/11.  Surely any thinking person who takes even the most cursory look at the evidence regarding 9/11 would know that the official story is bullshit.  But then they are faced with answering the question of why it was done and that can be very uncomfortable.</p>

<p>If you actually want to look, I can provide you with points to consider on the topic of the shape of the earth.  I should note that my own position on the matter is that the standard flat earth model does not work.  So I am not arguing for it.  But in the topic I have seen enough that my current opinion is that the official spinning globe model does not work either.</p>

<p>Do you want me to provide you with things to consider or would you rather not look?</p>
