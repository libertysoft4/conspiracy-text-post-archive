<p>If a post already has +10 when you read it (even if you don&#39;t consciously notice the score), you&#39;re biased to accept or agree with it. It&#39;s a weird form of group-think rarely seen on the internet since it involves a scoring system.</p>

<p>The algorithms behind what appears on the frontpage apparently depend largely on the polarity and timing of the first couple dozen votes. And those can easily be fan-club/shill votes garnered by immediately linking the post to an IRC or group Skype chat or whatever.</p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t noticed, there is a coordinated Bernie Sanders effort around here.  </p>

<p>You could post &quot;DAE Bernie Sanders?&quot; on askreddit and get 7000 upvotes.</p>

<p>Amazing how well Israel&#39;s candidate is doing on a Conde Naste owned site, huh?  ;)</p>

<p>What&#39;s even funnier is people believe that Israel&#39;s candidate would actually do something about the banks.  He hasn&#39;t even addressed the fraud that is our fiat currency and how money is created in our system.</p>

<p>Of course... anyone who doesn&#39;t buy his bullshit must not know about him.</p>

<p>Here he is telling people who want to end the genocide committed by Israel to &quot;Shut up&quot;.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vf2cCdgwgoM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vf2cCdgwgoM</a></p>

<p>Here he is legitimizing using violence against people that disagree with him and calls it &quot;civilized&quot;.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBIKP4W50-I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBIKP4W50-I</a></p>

<p>Maybe he and Elizabeth Warren can make a baby together and it will be born with a &quot;hope and change&quot; tattoo on its head.</p>

<p>Furthermore... you don&#39;t get it.  Nobody is going to save you... not sanders.. not Warren... nobody.  </p>

<p>The only person that can save you is yourself, but that would require you to actually do something about the situation that we are in.</p>

<p>so some assholes can not be civil about allowing him to actually answer their question you equate that to supporting israel? </p>

<p>his answer is a two state solution ffs what more do you want him to support murdering them all and give it back to palestine? im mean ffs, he gave an honest response and it was pretty much the exact opposite of what israel wants.</p>

<p>and that second guy is a babbling idiot, is he trying to argue that governments don&#39;t have a right to exist?</p>
