<p>CIA under Carter destabilized Iran leading to religious fundamentalists holding american hostages for over a year...</p>

<p>And he was afraid of a rabbit that one time.</p>

<p>But then he helped poor people to have homes -- not with money, but with a hammer.</p>

<p>He has spoken out about apartheid in Palestine and now about the oligarchy.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>No. That was the Shah and his huge social and military spending programs. Nixon and Ford were selling him everything but nukes. Back in the 1960&#39;s and early 70&#39;s, Iran was the USA&#39;s regional ally in the Gulf in much the same way the Saudis are (were?) today.</p>

<p>Anyways, the Shah overreached with the spending and decided to cut back the social spending while maintaining the military buildup. People didn&#39;t like it. They also didn&#39;t like his cultural modernization policies. The combination of these and other factors led to social chaos and the Shah&#39;s overthrow.</p>

<p>The Iranians knew that the CIA was quite active in Iran and they also remembered how the CIA helped put the Shah in power back in the day. The hostage taking by &quot;students&quot; was just an excuse to invade the US Embassy and go hunting for whatever stuff the CIA had left lying around.</p>

I&#39;m serious, I can find outright, blatant lies from every president back to Carter and beyond, but Carter was just an all-around <em>good person</em>.

    <div class="md"><p>you can still be a democracy as an oligarchy. It just means that people who own property have the power through holding the ear of government and the indigent masses have none. How is that different from anywhere really? The poor, disadvantaged, etc are without power. As they have always been. It kind of comes with the package.</p>

<p>EDIT: hmmn, it would appear that at least 3 people don&#39;t understand the various forms of democracy. Or they don&#39;t like hearing that an Oligarchy is quite common in most democracies. Anyway, Carter should know it&#39;s more of a plutocracy run by the USAs 400 or so Billionaires. lol</p>
