<p><strong>For every action there is an equal and opposite re-action.</strong></p>

<p>What does this mean?</p>

<p>This means that for every force there is a reaction force that is equal in size, but opposite in direction. That is to say that whenever an object pushes another object it gets pushed back in the opposite direction equally hard.</p>

<p>Many people are familiar with the fact that a rifle recoils when fired. This recoil is the result of action-reaction force pairs. A gunpowder explosion creates hot gases that expand outward allowing the rifle to push forward on the bullet. </p>

<p>Consistent with Newton&#39;s third law of motion, the bullet pushes backwards upon the rifle. The acceleration of the recoiling rifle is ...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>a. greater than the acceleration of the bullet.</p>

<p>b. smaller than the acceleration of the bullet.</p>

<p>c. the same size as the acceleration of the bullet.</p>

<p>The answer is b. Here&#39;s why:</p>

<p>The force on the rifle equals the force on the bullet. <strong>Yet, acceleration depends on both force and mass.</strong> The bullet has a greater acceleration due to the fact that it has a smaller mass. <strong>Remember: acceleration and mass are inversely proportional.</strong></p>

<p>Now...a <em>theory</em> has been put forth by Bazant (not NIST). And that theory has, in fact, been refuted in scientific papers.</p>

<p><a href="http://911speakout.org/wp-content/uploads/Some-Misunderstandings-Related-to-WTC-Collapse-Analysis.pdf">Some Misunderstandings Related to WTC Collapse Analysis</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>SUMMARY</p>

<p>A number of simple, transparent calculations of the North Tower collapse were presented in
[5] and the conclusion was that assuming even a modest resistance of columns during their
destruction would cause an unacceptably long collapse time. It is only when perfectly
frangible columns were adopted that the fall time was as low as 15.3 s. This removes the PCF
mode, as defined here, as a viable hypothesis of collapse.
Y
et, the PCF achieved significant popularity, as based on [1] and [2], while the next work
[12] did not contribute anything new to the core of the subject. These papers, purporting to
explain the collapse, suffered from three fatal errors, as detailed above. Also, the whole
methodology was not justified. Some incredibly short fall times were quoted by the authors,
while all solutions were of a black-box type. The presentations in these papers are not a valid
description of what happened. The reasons for a smooth motion history and promptness of
collapse of the North Tower remain yet to be determined.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fatal Error #1:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The main paper proposing the PCF mode [2] had several discussers involved. The closure
of the discussion [15] pointed out a few flaws that crept into the competing analysis [3],
although these flaws had no adverse effects on the results. The defense of the analysis
presented in [2], on the other hand, was essentially relying on ignoring the arguments to the
contrary. The gross underestimate of the energy absorption capacity of the squashed column
that resulted is named here as the fatal mistake No.1.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fatal Error #2:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From the above assumption Bazant concluded that after the initiation of failure of the
critical story, the columns in that squashed story offered only negligible resistance. That led
to the assumption that the upper part of the building, above that story, would be in a free fall
until a complete flattening of that story. At the end of the critical story squash the free-drop
velocity is over 8.5 m/s, resulting in a destructive impact. This in turn culminated in [2] as a
conclusion of a quick collapse of the entire edifice. We call this a “vanishing story
assumption” and refer to it as the fatal mistake No.2. (This free-fall assumption was not
openly stated, but there are numerous hints in [1, 2, 6] and [12] implying that it was used in
computational procedure.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fatal Error #3:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The texts of the criticized papers mention both criteria, although in a confused manner. In
[2], a statement on p.311 tells the reader that, in fact, the energy criterion renders the strength
criterion irrelevant. The conclusions echo that by saying: 
What matters is energy, not the
strength, nor stiffness.
Confronted with the results of discussion [3], showing a prompt arrest,
Bazant took a small step backward in Closure [15] by saying that the strength criterion was
valid in statics, but not in a dynamic environment, where inertia forces are involved. Thereby
the author missed the fundamental point, namely that 
the initiation of motion took place in a
static environment and therefore meeting the strength criterion was indispensable.
(Dynamics enters later, when significant accelerations or inertia forces are developed.)
Conclusion: The results were obtained while ignoring the strength criterion and are therefore
invalid on this count alone. (This was a visible confusion between statics and dynamics and
is regarded here as the fatal mistake No.3.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bazant and Zhou [7] published a paper titled “Why Did the World Trade Center Collapse? Simple Analysis” providing the engineering community with insights into why those steel structures collapsed. In their simple analysis it was assumed that the columns failed due to folding at the localized plastic hinges. This type of model is commonly employed for laterally loaded beams and girders, that is, assume that these structural members form plastic hinges at mid height during the motion of one storey closing the gap distance with its neighboring storey by bending into a closed scissors state. Bazant and Zhou [7] postulated that at least one plastic hinge and no more than three plastic hinges, per column line are needed to operate simultaneously in order to allow the upper part to continue moving down. It was argued that at the end, the sum of the rotation angles of the hinges on one column line cannot exceed 360°, and therefore, the most optimistic plastic energy dissipation in a column was taken as the plastic bending moment Mp of one column times the combined rotation angle of 2 radians. In one sense, it might be argued that such a hypothesis would overestimate the energy absorbing capacity, since the possibility of fracture in tension zones of the plastic hinge is excluded. On the other hand, the plastic hinge assumption might underestimate the capacity by virtue of disregarding the axial energy capacity and ignoring the slenderness parameter that is key to column design. An earlier study on square hollow shaped columns clearly shows that employing the plastic hinge analysis method very much underestimates the energy absorbing capacity during a squash type mechanism of collapse [8]. This investigation intends to explore whether H-shaped structural columns absorb more or less energy than predicted by the plastic hinge model [7]. This paper presents experimentally established energy dissipations associated with axially loaded H-shaped columns of intermediate slenderness and compares them to those established based on a plastic hinge model.</p>

<p>While our test program was very limited in the both the number and types of experiments undertaken, our findings suggest that the energy dissipation of axially loaded columns depends on various parameters, namely, slenderness of the column, tensile strength and the ductility of the material, and so forth, and its estimation is not a trivial matter.

<p>7.0 CONCLUDING REMARKS  </p>

<p>The elastic buckling of an ideally straight column pin ended at both ends and subjected to axial compression was considered. The elastic buckling load was shown to be dependent on the slenderness ratio (λ/r) of the column. Factors affecting the column strengths (viz. initial imperfection, eccentricity of loading, residual stresses and lack of well-defined elastic limit) were all individually considered...  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Free fall implies that there was no resistance to falling. This point of view theorizes that the structure must have been taken out from below it so that it could fall without resistance. This is obviously a poor argument, since the huge structure has tons of kinetic energy (it is big and heavy). Damage to higher level structural supports can cause failures in much lower levels. Think of a structural support being left carrying more weight than designed due to the other structural supports being damaged. Think of this as one pole just standing tall with some massive weight on the top. It doesn&#39;t matter at what level the other support was damaged and failed, this pole will break where it is weakest, which may be somewhere in the middle.</p>

<p>For a conclusive proof of controlled demolition from free fall, I would expect requiring almost the entire fall to be free fall (until stuff started bunching up at the bottom).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>SUMMARY</p>

<p>A number of simple, transparent calculations of the North Tower collapse were presented in
[5] and the conclusion was that assuming even a modest resistance of columns during their
destruction would cause an unacceptably long collapse time. It is only when perfectly
frangible columns were adopted that the fall time was as low as 15.3 s. This removes the PCF
mode, as defined here, as a viable hypothesis of collapse.
Y
et, the PCF achieved significant popularity, as based on [1] and [2], while the next work
[12] did not contribute anything new to the core of the subject. These papers, purporting to
explain the collapse, suffered from three fatal errors, as detailed above. Also, the whole
methodology was not justified. Some incredibly short fall times were quoted by the authors,
while all solutions were of a black-box type. The presentations in these papers are not a valid
description of what happened. The reasons for a smooth motion history and promptness of
collapse of the North Tower remain yet to be determined.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fatal Error #1:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The main paper proposing the PCF mode [2] had several discussers involved. The closure
of the discussion [15] pointed out a few flaws that crept into the competing analysis [3],
although these flaws had no adverse effects on the results. The defense of the analysis
presented in [2], on the other hand, was essentially relying on ignoring the arguments to the
contrary. The gross underestimate of the energy absorption capacity of the squashed column
that resulted is named here as the fatal mistake No.1.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fatal Error #2:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From the above assumption Bazant concluded that after the initiation of failure of the
critical story, the columns in that squashed story offered only negligible resistance. That led
to the assumption that the upper part of the building, above that story, would be in a free fall
until a complete flattening of that story. At the end of the critical story squash the free-drop
velocity is over 8.5 m/s, resulting in a destructive impact. This in turn culminated in [2] as a
conclusion of a quick collapse of the entire edifice. We call this a “vanishing story
assumption” and refer to it as the fatal mistake No.2. (This free-fall assumption was not
openly stated, but there are numerous hints in [1, 2, 6] and [12] implying that it was used in
computational procedure.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fatal Error #3:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The texts of the criticized papers mention both criteria, although in a confused manner. In
[2], a statement on p.311 tells the reader that, in fact, the energy criterion renders the strength
criterion irrelevant. The conclusions echo that by saying: 
What matters is energy, not the
strength, nor stiffness.
Confronted with the results of discussion [3], showing a prompt arrest,
Bazant took a small step backward in Closure [15] by saying that the strength criterion was
valid in statics, but not in a dynamic environment, where inertia forces are involved. Thereby
the author missed the fundamental point, namely that 
the initiation of motion took place in a
static environment and therefore meeting the strength criterion was indispensable.
(Dynamics enters later, when significant accelerations or inertia forces are developed.)
Conclusion: The results were obtained while ignoring the strength criterion and are therefore
invalid on this count alone. (This was a visible confusion between statics and dynamics and
is regarded here as the fatal mistake No.3.)</p>
