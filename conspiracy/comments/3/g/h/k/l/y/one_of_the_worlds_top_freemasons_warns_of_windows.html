        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Film director and top Freemason <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cameron">James Cameron</a> warned us of  <a href="http://www.moviemistakes.com/images/mistakegrabs/23924.jpg">9/11 in Terminator 2</a>, in Avatar he showed the world the true meaning of the word &#39;Terrorist&#39; (i.e. Terrorists are those who dare to defend themselves against the agendas of the super-rich and multi-national corporations) now in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_Genisys">Terminator Genisys</a> he warns of a new Operating System which has to be stopped or the war against TPTB will be lost once and forever.  </p>

<p>James Cameron mixes in high circles and is given information which the rest of us are not; Freemasons of his rank are known to be given information which is kept from the masses.  Given his past record, he appears to be one of the good guys.  He&#39;s also a vegan and he intends to make a film about when the US dropped atomic bombs on Japan i.e. raising awareness that the US are the only nation to have used weapons of mass destruction, in doing so they committed a crime against humanity.</p>

<p>Now straight after Terminator Genisys a &#39;free&#39; Windows 10 appears which is an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3f7qts/holy_crap_windows10_is_the_nsas_wet_dream_of_an/">NSA dream</a>, as it shares all our information with them.  It appears that Cameron was warning us through Terminator Genisys not to upgrade, as Windows 10 will make it a lot harder for the people to fight back and keep our remaining freedoms.</p>

<p><strong>Windows 10 is the Beginning of The End, Do Not Upgrade!!</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just want to point out something that people seem to be glossing over. To me it&#39;s the fox in the hen house.</p>

<p>We are in the middle of an electronic war with multiple factions in the world. China, Russia and others have been attacking the US infrastructure non stop. Yet, here we are today with an OS that seems to be very insecure.</p>

<p>My only theory I can assume allows this possibility is that the OS was intentionally released with backdoors and such in order to use all systems as a &quot;Zombie botnet&quot; type defense or offense.</p>

<p>That&#39;s my theory and I&#39;m sticking to it. There is no other logical conclusion.</p>

<p>One other interesting tidbit is that Windows 10 was developed and released exponentially quicker that all other past Microsoft operating systems. Microsoft was still working on the Windows 8.1 update in 2013. They already had Windows 10 in the works at that time. Windows 10 was announced in late 2014.</p>

<p>Even though the OS release cycle has dropped by a year since XP it just seems amazing to me that they could build a whole new operating system in just 2 years. I&#39;m assuming they either had outside help or they were given a platform partially completed at one point.</p>

<p>Also, what&#39;s their reasoning behind skipping 9? It seems like no big deal but that&#39;s just the numerology guy in me being curious.</p>

<p>skipping 9</p>

<p>What I heard was it was for legacy. Some software checks if the first number of the os is 9 (95, 98) and this could make trouble.
I want to emphasize this is what I heard. It may easily have been a comment on Imgur. </p>

<p>Another reason: an reason-less exception makes people talk about it. People talking about it is free commercial. </p>

<p>10 is not a whole new OS. That is rumored to still be in the works. Primarily, 10 is a update to old parts of the Windows &#39;kernel&#39; or core of it&#39;s code that hadn&#39;t been touched in years. </p>

<p>They skilled to Windows 10 because there are some critical infrastructure items that learned to differentiate versions via it&#39;s proper name. Therefore Windows 9 (new) would be lumped in with Windows 95 and Windows 98, Two OSes that Windows 10 is beyond. </p>

<p>Ha! You have no idea!</p>

<p>Not counting the groups that Freemasons have gone off and created that are non-Masonic; the groups that were Masonic-like that were founded by non-Freemasons (e.g. Illuminati) and all of the other edge-cases, just variant Masonic formats, Masonic splinter groups, schisms, offshoots and pretenders include:</p>

<p>Prince Hall (US), Swedish Rite Masonry, Scottish Rite Craft Masonry (not to be confused with the Scottish Rite Freemasonry that you&#39;ve probably heard of, but the sort of all-Scottish-Rite-from-the-start that you see in Central and South America), irregular Continental Freemasonry, Comasonry, Chinese Freemasons, the amusingly irregular Regular Grand Lodge of England, The American Federation of Human Rights, etc.</p>

<p>That&#39;s just a taste of the groups that range from perfectly legitimate Masonry (Prince Hall, Swedish Rite, etc.) with some important differences from their mainstream counterparts to the outright invented whole-cloth (e.g Regular Grand Lodge of England). There have been hundreds of such organizations over the years, and they pop up all the time.</p>

<p>We can&#39;t control these groups because Freemasonry is just a system of mutual recognition. If someone decides that that mutual recognition doesn&#39;t matter to them (e.g. Grand Orient de France in the mid-19th century until the present day) then the rest of Freemasonry has no control over them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With billions of people updating their systems to Win10, you really think the NSA or who ever is going to sit there and collect our information off of millions of people, sounds like a stress job, or these people have no lives, besides to look at your info.. I just think there is too many people to monitor, and it would cost a lot of money and time. I will always stick to my WinXP, there is nothing wrong with it, and it works perfect. I have all the updates, and have the secret files, to update it if I need to reinstall XP... good luck with WIN10, and I find Linux a bore... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hollywood talk. Even the phrasing is interesting: they &quot;ASK&quot;ed Cameron for input. That doesn&#39;t mean he responded or offered any input.</p>

<p>That movie was a piece of shit, btw. Do you really think Cameron had anything to do with it? I notice he&#39;s said it&#39;s the &quot;real third movie,&quot; but I thought it was a really rotten reboot. </p>
