        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><h2>I just read this post in another thread and wanted to repost here to see what <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> makes of this. Are there any plastic experts or scientists here out of the 330,000 users? So Los Angles County just dumped 96 million black plastic balls in the open air water reservoirs around LA. So far, they have been in the water in other reservoirs for at least 6 years. Most people in LA have no idea about this when you ask them. So war about 90% of the college educated professionals and locals had no idea. Some of the staff at Orange Products who make the plastic HDPE balls don&#39;t even know that these are going in drinking water for 5 years. LA county just dumped a few more million. Clip from yesterday: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YGQGn-u8lM&amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YGQGn-u8lM&amp;feature=youtu.be</a> . Many people around the world have the question will these 96 million plastic High-density polyethylene balls break down in the sun over 5 years? If so, besides synthetic estrogen created, what other health effects would the people drinking the water experience? We know that synthetic estrogen in women increases breast cancer, and extra estrogen in men can effect their behavior and children&#39;s grown. RT NEWS covered this yesterday: <a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/312219-shade-balls-california-drought/">https://www.rt.com/usa/312219-shade-balls-california-drought/</a> . To top off the list of shady things with this story, 6 years ago they put the balls in the water to &quot;stop a chemical process&quot; or to &quot;stop bird waste&quot;. Now the county is saying &quot;they are doing this because of the drought&quot;. So which one is the real reason at this point? Watch what you drink. </h2>

<p><strong>PLEASE CALL / EMAIL / WRITE LA COUNTY AND LET THEM KNOW THIS LACK OF REGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH IS UNNACEPTABLE</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe they don&#39;t come in white.  Most plastic doesn&#39;t. You might have noticed that your computer case started out light gray, but over the years turned darker and yellowish. That&#39;s why most cases come dyed black now, so you won&#39;t get the color change. They probably got the dark colored balls so over the years they wouldn&#39;t look dirtier and dirtier and more disgusting and freak people out. So they decided on something that didn&#39;t look bad, without considering if they leached out harmful chemicals.   </p>

<p>I just posted an article today about how DuPont has been hiding, for decades, how toxic many of their products are. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3gqj0j/dupont_has_knowingly_poisoned_us_for_decades_for/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3gqj0j/dupont_has_knowingly_poisoned_us_for_decades_for/</a></p>

<p>I do totally get that just because it&#39;s considered food safe doesn&#39;t mean that it actually is; it may be for example that most of the studies over the years focused on new HDPE and not HDPE exposed to chlorinated water in the sunlight for long periods of time.

<p>&quot;Hdpe does not break down under sunlight or extreme heat.&quot; - LiterallyAShill 2015</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I suppose that&#39;s why there are papers written on degradation of HDPE in exposure to heat and UV radiation?<a href="http://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/41165(397)211">http://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/41165(397)211</a></p>

<p>(pdf link below - who uses parentheses in urls anyway, jeez) </p>

<p>HDPE geomembranes have low puncture resistance and low multi-axial extensibility, and are therefore, considered to  be disadvantageous in applications  where these properties are desirable, for example, in landfill cover applications (Simpson and Siebken 1997; Scheirs 2009).</p>

<p><strong>Exposed geomembranes  are highly susceptible to degradation by  UV, oxidative, and thermal mechanisms</strong>  (Koerner et al. 1990, 2005). At a given time, more  than one degradation mechanism  can  take place and the resulting  <strong>synergistic effects can accelerate the degradation</strong>  processes. Of the degradation  mechanisms, UV degradation is the  most harmful for an exposed geomembrane (Qureshi et al. 1989).</p>

<p>According to Suits and Hsuan (2003), photons with similar or higher energy than the energy  of the polymer chemical bonds cause a series of reactions to polymers that are exposed to sunlight  and liberate free radicals which cause bond scission in the polymeric structure  and  eventually  makes  the polymer brittle and susceptible to environmental stress cracking. For instance, the chemical bond strengths  of C-C and C-H bonds are 420 and 340 kJ/mol, respectively. On the other hand, the energies of 300 and 400 nm  photons (in the UV range) are 390 and 300 kJ/mol, respectively (Suits and Hsuan 2003).</p>

<p>That makes absolutely zero sense.  I make my living working with polymers.  If your goal is to prevent water from evaporating, then you would want to introduce as little heat as possible to the water, thus why you would not want them to absorb heat.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the conductance of heat from the water to the plastic balls would not be dependent on the color.</p>

Some of the articles I read are that they are concerned about bromide which is created when chlorine and bromine are combined together and exposed to sunlight.  These articles say the balls are to cut the light out to control the bromide since bromine is a naturally occurring element and chlorine is used to disinfect the water.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im gonna go ahead and go with the scientific consensus and not the man wearing a tin hat typing IN ALL CAPITALS. Do you even know the purpose? Its to reduce evaporation <em>and</em> to stop algae from growing in the reservoirs. Yes, the plastic is safe, and no it will not cause more evaporation. Hot water does not evaporate until it gets hot enough, which it wont do, even with these <strong>and</strong> this lowers the surface area for water to evaporate from.</p>

<p>Sure, some plastics like BPA don&#39;t mix with water and sun, but we run most of our water through PVC and we&#39;re fine. HDPE plastic is perfectly safe in temperatures up to 260 degrees before it even begins to think about degradation. On top of that, California has some of the strictest water standards in the country, if there was anything dangerous in the water it would be shut down before your dog could take a shit. Please, do tell me a solution that will save 300 <em>billion</em> with a <strong>B</strong>  gallons of water from evaporating and prevent algae from growing in the drinking water. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your &quot;Suggestion&quot; is not scaleable, it can not be retracted or expanded with increasing water levels, which happens in reservoirs at a much higher level, unlike dams and ponds which are generally stable throughout the year. They started worrying about algae now because of new water standards. You have a lot of confidence in yourself for someone that I assume hasn&#39;t talked to a legitimate friend in days, because of your schizophrenia. I also suggest that you learn to reply ones to a comment instead of staying up all night replying to the same comment over and over when you realize &quot;hey, I might be wrong!

    <div class="md"><p>Come to think of it, the shade balls were rolling in for a while before they hit water. That tells me the water level is low. What happens when it fills up again? The balls will then be covering only the center while the rest is uncovered as it fills in. Better get more shade balls. When does it end? How in the hell do those reserviors get filled to where they are by the falling rainwater directly above it alone? Surely it comes from other places... And what did they do to prevent algae before shade balls happened last week? Why did it take them this long to care about algae prevention?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if they put the balls in there to absorb sunlight and heat so water doesn&#39;t evaporate, and they change the balls out before the sun has enough time to break them down? Highly doubt they are going to leave these things there for years and years. (edit: looks like they will be changed after 10 years. Seeing as I don&#39;t know how long these take to break down, I can&#39;t comment on whether that is too long or not) </p>

<p>Also, are there sources that indicate how long these take to break down and what compounds they break down to, or are you just assuming? </p>

<p>Sounds like a good idea. </p>

<p>This is not a question of &quot;preventing evaporation&quot; this is a question of a county perpetuating chemical warfare against a USA civilian population. This entire act is no less than criminal. There are already people talking about filing a class action. </p>

<p>The black UV protection is discussed and they address how the increase in temperature is outweighed by the excellent UV protection of the carbon black. </p>

<p>UV is what degrades HDPE so protection against those frequencies should eliminate the theat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure how I feel about HDPE but if I recall correctly I thought it was considered pretty stable and food safe, and is commonly used in food production eg. greenhouses, farms, etc. </p>

<p>I do totally get that just because it&#39;s considered food safe doesn&#39;t mean that it actually is; it may be for example that most of the studies over the years focused on new HDPE and not HDPE exposed to chlorinated water in the sunlight for long periods of time. It&#39;s good to question things,</p>
