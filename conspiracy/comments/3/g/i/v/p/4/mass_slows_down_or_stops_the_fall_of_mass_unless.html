    <div class="md"><p>you missed the pun, and obviously don&#39;t understand physics.   Jerk is the rate of change of acceleration.   The hammer experiences jerk as it hits the nail.   </p>

<p>You can swing a hammer hard and reduce the jerk, but here we have building going from zero velocity at gravitational acceleration for a few feet - encountering negligible resistance and exhibiting no jerk.  Also you can CLEARLY see the explosions cascade down the buildings, witnesses report seeing and hearing them, and explosives were found in the dust.  You have nothing.</p>

<p>Molten metal was found pooling in the footprint of the twin towers a month after it was brought down. ALSO, there ARE PICS... And I&#39;ll try to find em, that showed the support beams w/ a 45 deg. Cut in them, with slag all around the cut ,as they were torch cut at the bottom.  ( Iam a welder btw , so I know what to look for. ) only thermite could melt steel like that , and leave a molten pool behind. </p>

<p>A fire started with thermite will provide its own oxygen , and so it burns white. That&#39;s clearly seen in the piles of rubble , where the fires are burning down in the basement. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The acceleration of gravity in New York City is 32.159 ft/s2. WTC7 had 2.25 seconds of literal freefall, this is equivalent to approximately 8 stories of fall in which the falling section of the building encountered zero resistance. The collapse was complete in 6.5 seconds. Free-fall time in a vacuum, from Building 7&#39;s roof is 5.96 seconds.</p>

<p>You can refer to the NIST report that agrees with me, only because they were forced to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/YmynBCH.jpg">The tilting of the south tower,</a> just before collapse.</p>

<p>According to Sir Isaac Newton’s law of the conservation of momentum, it should have kept tipping over, but it didn&#39;t, it fell through the path of greatest resistance. The top was tilting at approximately 20 degrees or so, how could it be exerting a uniform, symmetrical pressure on the floors below? it didn&#39;t and couldn&#39;t.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nhsn9w9Vg">Watch a compilation of the collapse</a> what you are observing is approximately 30 upper floors begin to rotate as a block, to the south and east.They begin to topple over, not fall straight down.The torque due to gravity on this block is enormous, as is its angular momentum. But then  this block turned mostly to powder in mid-air! How can we understand this strange behavior, without explosives?</p>

<p>[Video evidence also shows that the lower sections of the Towers do not even begin to start collapsing until the upper sections are completely destroyed]([Imgur](<a href="http://i.imgur.com/Ag88tNY.jpg%5C)">http://i.imgur.com/Ag88tNY.jpg\)</a>) This is an impossibility if we are to believe the official reports </p>

<hr/>

<p>NIST&#39;s global collapse theory, in regards the complete collapse of two 110 story skyscrapers violates Newton&#39;s laws of motion.</p>

<p>It is scientifically impossible and completely illogical that these two buildings, which had an upper block exerting a force of only 36% of its static weight, could crush the larger, stronger, undamaged lower section of the building
to the ground, when the building, at any level, was designed to support several times the weight above
it,  while it maintains its downward acceleration. </p>

<p>The persistent acceleration of the top section of the building is
direct evidence that some other source of energy was used to remove the structure below it, </p>

<p>Videos show that the section of the building above the plane impact point was the first section to disintegrate</p>

<hr/>

<p>For the Twin Towers (WTC1/2), NIST examined only the period BEFORE the actual destructions began but nevertheless concluded that there was </p>

<blockquote>
<p>no corroborating evidence ... for controlled demolition using explosives - NIST NCSTAR 1 report, pages xxxvii and xxxviii</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This approach ignored the fact that most evidence of controlled demolition appears only after a demolition begins</p>

<hr/>

<p>NIST never attempted to explain the physical evidence of the building destructions such as what caused four ton
perimeter columns and other debris to be ejected horizontally in all directions from the “collapsing” Towers at speeds of up to 70 mph, or why column sections weighing many tons were stuck in buildings hundreds of meters  from the Towers as in the following pictures</p>

<hr/>

<p>NIST’s study...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>does not actually include the structural behavior of the tower after the conditions for collapse
initiation were reached and collapse became inevitable  - NIST NCSTAR 1 report, page 82, footnote 13</p>
</blockquote>

<p>NIST’s model did not proceed past the point where initiation of collapse was asserted to be imminent and therefore did not cover the actual collapse. The collapse was clearly the crucial portion of the investigation. This omission was in defiance of the stated objective to determine</p>

<blockquote>
<p>why and how WTC1 and WTC2 collapsed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>NIST claims that a floor sagging downward pulled in exterior columns initiating the collapse. NIST provides no theory whereby a sagging floor or buckling columns on one side could lead to the observed completely vertical descent. There is no explanation for the crushing and pulverization of the undamaged, stronger, much larger portion of the building underneath at about two-thirds of free-fall acceleration, no explanation of how the upper portion disintegrated in midair and no explanation for the horizontal ejection of a large fraction of the building structure</p>

<p>NIST’s 10,000 pages of NCSTAR reports clearly lack the most essential theory needed to substantiate a gravity-
driven collapse. NIST’s WTC1/2 computer model also appear to be fabricated, and there is no way to judge the model without independent scrutiny. NIST’s failure to follow the NFPA code and test for explosives and omission of key evidence for controlled demolition is falsification since it concerns highly relevant data that was excluded. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent.    If Newton&#39;s Laws are violated by the NIST report,   then maybe this matter needs to be the only matter we stick with until it is resolved.     </p>

<p>Sure would be nice if someone could model the buildings with full support and support removed to show a sensitivity analysis.    Just how much of the structural integrity below the point of damage would have to be removed in order to initiate collapse,  and even then,  at what speed of fall,  and with what symetry?    Make the program free,   distribute it,  and let people work with it.     Open source.    Pro-science.    Help design for future safety.    All good,  interesting stuff.    Oh,  and if you want to pretend there are no interior columns on WTC one and two,   you can do that too,  only the model discloses it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The acceleration of gravity is nothing more than the rate at which the an object speed increases in free fall, neglecting air resistance. It causes an object to increase its speed to about 9.78m/s every second (usually abbreviated to 9.78 m/s2). It has small variations at each site on the planet, but in New York is 9.808 m/s2.</p>

<p>Isaac Newton showed that the acceleration of an object is governed by the mass of the object and the resultant force acting on it (Newton&#39;s Second Law: F = m x a). If the acceleration of a falling object is equal to the acceleration of gravity, then the resultant force is only the force of gravity.</p>

<p>In addition, Newton&#39;s Third Law tells us that when objects interact they exert equal and opposite forces between them. So as an object is falling if it exerts a force on objects in its path, the same objects will exert the same force, just in the opposite direction, i.e. upwards, which will decrease the acceleration of fall. If an object is observed in free fall we can safely conclude that nothing in its path exerts a breaking force and by Newton&#39;s Third Law the falling object can’t be colliding with any other object as well.</p>

<p>Usually when the top of a building collapses we expect to see the falling part hit the structure bellow exerting a considerable force. But is not what occurs in WTC 7 and we know this because the top of WTC 7 fell at freefall, not near free fall. It fell by almost 2.5 seconds at a rate of free fall, i.e., 9,808 m/s2. If the top had crushed the part bellow, this parts would have reacted with a strength of the same intensity but opposite that would have decreased the acceleration of falling block. As the fall has not decreased, we conclude that the interaction force was zero in both directions.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10669-008-9182-4">Environmental anomalies at the World Trade Center: evidence for energetic materials</a></strong> is a  Peer-reviewed scientific analysis of the environmental data collected at Ground Zero in the months following 9/11, that indicated that violent incendiary fires were occurring, that could not be put out, dispute millions of gallons of water being poured over the site and the use of chemical fire suppressants</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Investigators monitoring air quality at the World Trade Center, after the September 11th attacks, found extremely high levels of volatile organic chemicals as well as unusual species that had never been seen before in structure fires. Data collected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency indicate striking spikes in levels of benzene, styrene, and several other products of combustion</p>

<p>Only thermite, which contains its own oxidant and therefore cannot be extinguished by smothering it, can explain this evidence</p>

<p>lets start with this, you linked to bentham who does not have a proper peer review system. They didn&#39;t publish in the the legitimate Chemical Physics journal or the Journal of Chemical Physics (yes, they are two different ones). They published in the Bentham Open Chemical Physics Journal.</p>

<p>secondly, lets go to their study shall we:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What is the origin of the samples? Who owned the chain of custody? What steps were taken to preserve the integrity of the samples? </p>

<p>According to the paper, “Active Thermitic Material Discovered in Dust from the 9/11 World Trade Center Catastrophe*”,  the samples analyzed were obtained by citizens of NY on 9/11 and 9/12. These four samples were not collected and stored in sterile containers, nor is there any information guaranteeing that these four samples have not been contaminated. In a call for samples put out in 2006, five years during which samples could become contaminated, only five samples were able to collected and none by other researchers that obtained dust samples in sterile containers? In the Materials &amp; Methods section, there are no sources given about standard sample collection procedure nor is there any information as to requirements for samples obtained, i.e., was the “general request” merely for dust collected in proximity to the WTC following collapse or was it more specific in asking for only samples in which these “red/gray chips” of such interest could be found? Without information about sample collection, the “experimental” results are void. The fact that the fifth sample obtained was not included in the study due to the owners unwillingness to disclose his identity is suspicious and requires explanation. Again, citations showing standard sample collection procedures are needed.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>What is this evidence for thermite?  Is it simply trace elements that could be commonly associated with many other sources, or is it something that can only be explained by the use of thermite?</p>

<p>Steve Jones has claimed to have found iron, sulfur, aluminum, potassium, manganese, fluorine &amp; titanium in the samples he tested, all of which are commonly used in thermite. Could there be another possible (and more likely) explanation for these elements being found?</p>

<p>Sulfur: The third most common ingredient in the WTC construction was gypsum-based drywall, which is 18.62% sulfur.</p>

<p>Iron: Used in paint &amp; electronic devices.</p>

<p>Potassium: Used in concrete.</p>

<p>Manganese: Used in the structural steel, paint, batteries, &amp; ceramics.</p>

<p>Fluorine: Used in Freon. 200,000 pounds of Freon cooled the WTC complex. This was the largest air-conditioning system in the country.</p>

<p>Titanium: Used in paper &amp; paint &amp; made up 2% of each of the 767’s. WTC7 was also clad in polished steel &amp; titanium.</p>

<p>Wouldn’t it make sense to find natural sources for these elements before jumping to “thermite” as a cause?</p>

<p>Another of Jones’ claims is that 3000lbs of thermite (1000lbs per building) would be needed to demolish the three buildings (WTC 1,2, and 7).  Thermite is 2% sulfur, thus the total amount of sulfur in the theoretical thermite charges would be about 60 pounds.  Approximately 1 million tons (2 billion pounds) of dust blanketed lower Manhattan. So, based on Professor Jones’ estimates, a thermite reaction would result in the WTC dust containing approximately 0.000003% (3 millionths of a percent) sulfur.  Such a low percentage would be unlikely to be detected, especially when compared to USGS dust samples in which as much as 5.4% sulfur was reported.  Now, since we have elements which have a natural explanation, how about chemical signatures that are unique to thermite, such as aluminum oxide and barium nitrate?  Neither the USGS nor Steven Jones himself report finding any traces of either of these elements – two telltale elements of thermite.</p>

<p>Jones also claims to have detected 1,3-diphenylpropane from “sol-gel” used to affix the thermite to the support structure of the building.  1,3-diphenylpropane is a common bi-product of burning polyvinyl chloride (plastic).  Considering the massive amounts of plastic in use in two 110 story  (and one 47 story) office buildings, this would be a much more likely case than the much smaller amount of sol-gel necessary to place 3000lbs of thermate charges.  Also, 1,3-diphenylpropane was reported by the EPA three weeks after the attacks. *  This is even mentioned in an article that Steve Jones sources. **</p>

<p>Does Prof. Jones have credentials that enable him to make these claims?  Does he have training as a civil engineer, in demolition or building collapse forensics?  Is he a metallurgist?  Was his paper submitted for peer review in a respected journal related to the topic of his paper, such as The Journal of Engineering Mechanics?</p>

<p>This violates basic Newtonian physics, IF, you choose to believe the official report that fires caused the collapse, obviously it is impossible for a building to go into freefall in any other scenario, this explains why NIST refuse to release there data for independent validation, the only relevant documents that support their theory that fire brought down a steel framed building (first time in history, still to this day) <a href="http://cryptome.org/nist070709.pdf">are classified for public safety</a>, they will not even release them to a <a href="http://cryptome.org/wtc-nist-wtc7-no.pdf">licensed NYC architect in regards a FOIA request</a></p>

<p>Why are they hiding this data? Likely because it is not based on any known science and engineering principles</p>

<p>This is evidenced by the fact the four simulations that NIST performed with their &quot;global LS-DYNA model&quot; None of the computer animations look anything like the actual observed collapse, the models and alleged simulations are not based in reality</p>

<p>NIST’s investigation absolutely begins and ends in the realm of computer simulation, manipulating the numbers to try and achieve the observed conditions, which they couldn’t even do, regardless of this fact, a computer simulation does not constitute an explanation and computer modelling is, at best, only as good as the input it receives and NIST will not give us their numbers</p>

<p>They never even bothered to fully model the structure</p>

<p>And as far as the “withheld data due to national security” goes, until it is known and is in the public domain, it will be impossible for outsiders to know exactly what it supports, as it is right now, the NIST report can be considered a work of science fiction </p>

<p>Their findings cannot be replicated or falsified due to the withholding of data and so if anyone outside of NIST believes what they say, they believe it on pure faith. </p>

<p>The acceleration of gravity in New York City is 32.159 ft/s2. WTC7 had 2.25 seconds of literal freefall, this is equivalent to approximately 8 stories of fall in which the falling section of the building encountered zero resistance. The collapse was complete in 6.5 seconds. Free-fall time in a vacuum, from Building 7&#39;s roof is 5.96 seconds</p>

<p>For any object to fall at gravitational acceleration, there can be nothing below it that would tend to impede its progress or offer any resistance. If there is anything below it that would tend to impede its progress or offer any resistance, then not all of the potential energy of the object would be converted to motion and so would not be found falling at gravitational acceleration (where did every single structural supporting columns go, instantly, at the exact same time?)</p>

<p>There&#39;s no exception to that rule, those are the conditions that must exist for gravitational acceleration to occur for the entirety of the duration of the time it occurs, this is basic Newtonian physical principles.</p>

<p>You either agree with this very basic concept, or you need to start making a case for a new realm of science that has never been witnessed before.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltP2t9nq9fI">Remember also that the BBC even reported that the building had collapsed 20minutes before it had</a>, remarkable.</p>

<hr/>

<p>The fact that Building 7 underwent free-fall means that none of the building’s potential energy was used to crush the structure below it. All of its potential energy was converted directly into energy of motion (kinetic energy), leaving no energy to do anything else. Therefore, the lower section of the building could not have been crushed by the falling section. The destruction of at least 8 stories of the lower section of the building had to have been accomplished by other means to allow the upper section of the building to fall through it in free-fall.</p>

<p>NIST’s theory is that the failure of a single column near the east end of the building caused neighboring columns to fail in a progressive manner. This is contradicted by the observed simultaneous collapse across the entire width of the building, which fell with a level roofline. A progressive collapse mechanism would have led to a progression of failures, visible deformation of the building, and gradual, asymmetrical collapse. This is what NIST’s computer model shows, but it is not what was observed. What we observed was the sudden onset of free-fall across the entire width of the building, which can only be achieved by controlled demolition.</p>

<p><strong>It&#39;s your interpretation. Please own your bad physics questions.</strong> <em>Here&#39;s the answer to your clueless question:</em></p>

<p>Dominoes provide a very interesting example of how physics works. When someone lines dominoes up and make one fall over, it creates a ripple affect as one falls on top of the other on top of the other and so on. That is where the term “domino affect” comes from. This action involves both types of energy, kinetic and potential. According to C.R. Nave from “Hyperphysics”, Kinetic energy is energy that is in motion. Potential energy is when an object is in a singular position that could result in energy from the result of work (Nave). When all of the dominoes are lined up, there is potential energy. When the dominoes are falling, that is an example of kinetic energy. The entire physic involved in falling dominoes is all a very interesting phenomenon. The reason for why this all happens is because of Newton’s Laws of Motion.</p>

<p>Kinetic energy applies to dominos in a variety of ways. An object obtaining kinetic energy will cause work to be done on any object it hits (Nave). When a domino is falling, it will hit the domino that lies in front of it. This means that work is happening when dominos fall on top of each other. This always deals with Newton’s Second Law of Motion, or the law of inertia. This law can be converted into an equations that is Force = Mass x Acceleration, according to Michael Sirois from Rice University If the mass of a domino could be calculated, and also the acceleration, then it would be possible to know the force that a falling domino exerts. In fact, if any of the two quantities in the formula were known, then it would be possible to figure out the rest of the equation.</p>

<p>Potential energy found in dominoes is known as gravitational potential energy (“Hyperphysics”). Any object actually obtains energy, even if it is not moving. When the object is not moving, its energy is the force that gravity has on it. Gravitational potential energy applies to every single object that is at rest on the Earth. Gravity is keeping them in place with the force that is applied to the objects. The force that it has is equal to the mass of the object, so it is all balanced out. When dominoes are standing up in line waiting to be knocked down, gravity is at work in keeping them stationary. Forces are balanced, so the dominoes are not flying around in space, or digging a whole in the Earth.</p>

<p>The acceleration of an object as produced by a net force is direct proportional to the magnitude of the net force, and inversely proportional to the images of the object.</p>

<p>The law of inertia and the third law of motion</p>

<p>What caused the first domino to fall against the second, there is your answer.</p>

You always have to do repair work in a house like that, because I swear, these fuckers are ALIVE. They BREATHE. If you have never fallen asleep to the tune of creaking, 500 year old, dry oak wood as a child, never stood in awe in front of an oaken column riddled with billions of wood worm holes as if it were a sponge and STILL failed to sink a nail into the wood, you will NEVER understand what is so fucking awesome about a STEEL skyscraper falling straight down through itself, completely disintegrating. </p>

<p>NIST admit WTC7 went into freefall in the official report.</p>

<p>How do you not know this? Now that i have proven you wrong, are you going to apologize for calling me a nutjob, when it was you in the wrong and were more of a nutjob?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That isn&#39;t true.  It&#39;s not private, secure, or secret, but it remains classified.</p>

<p>&quot;Classified&quot; means something was put into a legal category, not that it remains private.  That&#39;s the issue with disclosing things you&#39;ve agreed to keep secret for the government -- it&#39;s a felony.  In the case of National Security information, the penalty goes all the way up to &quot;firing squad.&quot;</p>

<p>Notice how you still haven&#39;t responded to the way I debunked your conspiratorial post. You can&#39;t refute anything I posted, so I&#39;ll go ahead and assume you conceded that you were wrong: if not please refute what I posted</p>

<p>I&#39;ll wait......</p>

<p>Thus, I know you are a typical truther that can&#39;t back up anything they post and retreat when challenged </p>

<p>Hahahahahaha</p>
