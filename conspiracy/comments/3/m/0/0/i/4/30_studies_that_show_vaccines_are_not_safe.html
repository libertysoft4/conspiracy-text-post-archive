<p>Some worrying studies/information:-</p>

<p>Here a professor explains his findings regarding the dangers of injecting Aluminum, which is contained in most vaccines</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCzdliixnmI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCzdliixnmI</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s the study itself</p>

<p><strong>Aluminum adjuvant linked to Gulf War illness induces motor neuron death in mice</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17114826/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17114826/</a></p>

<p>The HPV vaccine has been sending girls into early Menopause</p>

<p><strong>Human papilloma virus vaccine and primary ovarian failure: another facet of the autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants.</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23902317">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23902317</a></p>

<p>This study found that when you compare the First World nations, the more vaccine a country gives to it&#39;s children, the worse the infant mortality rate.</p>

<p><strong>Infant mortality rates regressed against number of vaccine doses routinely given</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3170075/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3170075/</a></p>

<p>There is evidence that the Hib vaccine (given to children) is causing a % to go down Diabetes Type 1, this is autoimmune and leaves you dependent on expensive medication for life.  The theoretical benefit of the vaccine is low.</p>

<p><strong>Association between type 1 diabetes and Hib vaccine
Causal relation is likely</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1116914/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1116914/</a></p>

<p>This doctor looks through the risk V benefits of each vaccine in the childhood schedule, she concludes that the risk of each vaccine outweighs any theoretical benefit.</p>

<p><strong>Vaccines - The Risks, The Benefits, The Choices</strong></p>

<p><strong>Professor Gordon T. Stewart, Emeritus Professor of Public Health, Glasgow University, explains exactly the dangers of the Whopping Cough vaccine</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.vaccinationinformationnetwork.com/the-dangers-of-whooping-cough-vaccination-prof-gordon-stewart/">http://www.vaccinationinformationnetwork.com/the-dangers-of-whooping-cough-vaccination-prof-gordon-stewart/</a></p>

<p>&quot;the marginal advantages of the vaccine in children over one year of age have to be offset against adverse effects of the vaccine itself, which are very common indeed and may be followed occasionally by irreversible brain damage, paralysis and mental deficiency. Because of this danger, or for fear of it, many parents and doctors are reluctant to vaccinate their children.&quot;</p>

<p>This recent study found that it is the vaccines made using aborted fetal cells which are causing Autism</p>

<p><strong>Impact of environmental factors on the prevalence of
autistic disorder after 1979</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.ms.academicjournals.org/article/article1409245960_Deisher%20et%20al.pdf">http://www.ms.academicjournals.org/article/article1409245960_Deisher%20et%20al.pdf</a></p>

<p>A CDC whistleblower recently admitted that he was part of the vaccines/Autism cover-up, they deliberately hid the data showing the dangers.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;My name is William Thompson.  I am a Senior Scientist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, where I have worked since 1998.</strong></p>

<p><strong>I regret that my coauthors and I omitted statistically significant information  in our 2004 article published in the journal Pediatrics. The omitted data suggested that African American males who received the MMR vaccine before age 36 months were at increased risk for autism.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.morganverkamp.com/august-27-2014-press-release-statement-of-william-w-thompson-ph-d-regarding-the-2004-article-examining-the-possibility-of-a-relationship-between-mmr-vaccine-and-autism/">http://www.morganverkamp.com/august-27-2014-press-release-statement-of-william-w-thompson-ph-d-regarding-the-2004-article-examining-the-possibility-of-a-relationship-between-mmr-vaccine-and-autism/</a></p>

<p>Under Freedom of Information we see that CDC experts privately admit the dangers of vaccines, they admit that vaccines are causing neurological problems, speech delays and they warn the information must be embargoed.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.aapsonline.org/vaccines/cdcfdaexperts.htm">http://www.aapsonline.org/vaccines/cdcfdaexperts.htm</a></p>

<p>Key quotes below:-</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Johnston, pg. 14-15 &amp; 19-20: &quot;The data on its toxicity (shows) it can cause neurologic and renal toxicity, including death.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Weil, pg. 24: &quot;There are just a host of neurodevelopmental data that would suggest that we’ve got a serious problem.&quot; .... &quot;the potential for aluminum and central nervous system toxicity was established by dialysis data. To think there isn’t some possible problem here is unreal.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Verstraeten, pg. 31: &quot;we have found statistically significant relationships between the exposure and outcomes for these different exposures and outcomes.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Verstraeten, pg. 44: &quot;Now for speech delays, which is the largest single disorder in this category of neurologic delays. The results are a suggestion of a trend with a small dip. The overall test for trend is highly statistically significant above one.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Bernier, pg. 113: &quot;So we are asking people who have a great job protecting this information up until now, to continue to do that until the time of the ACIP meeting. So to basically consider this embargoed information.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Johnson, pg. 198: &quot;This association leads me to favor a recommendation that infants up to two years old not be immunized with Thimerosal containing vaccines if suitable alternative preparations are available.” ... &quot;I do not want that grandson to get a Thimerosal containing vaccine until we know better what is going on.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Weil, pg. 207: &quot;The number of dose related relationships are linear and statistically significant. You can play with this all you want. They are linear. They are statistically significant.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Brent, pg. 229 &quot;we are in a bad position from the standpoint of defending any lawsuits&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Clements, pg 247- 249: &quot;that I am very concerned that this has gotten this far, and that having got this far, how you present in a concerted voice the information to the ACIP in a way they will be able to handle it and not get exposed&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Bernier, pg. 256: &quot;just consider this embargoed information, if I can use that term, and very highly protected information&quot;</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>The paper written by Jon S. Poling doesn&#39;t belong on this list.</p>

<p>His daughter developed encephalopathic seizures and autism following vaccinations.  The paper is likely about her, and that&#39;s a pretty big conflict of interest if you&#39;re trying to make an argument.</p>

<p>Anyway, Dr. Poling isn&#39;t even against vaccinations.  His daughter&#39;s case was an unusual circumstance and he simply believes more research should be done to avoid similar situations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Issues with these articles by OP:</p>

<p>1.This was a study that relied on parents and recall; thus the potential for recall bias. It also does not take into account confounders, such as alcoholism: a known cause of autism.
Found here: <a href="http://bit.ly/1ixJYe3">http://bit.ly/1ixJYe3</a></p>

<p>2.Same problem as 1. It is based on recall of the parent, nor does it provide all confounders. The issue of course in this study is when was Hep B introduced fully? 1996. And in this study it included ages of 17. If these kids had autism, how the fuck do you get it at 17 in 1996 from Hep B when you get autism diagnosis around age 3? No that&#39;s right, again it&#39;s weak study. The Op was kind enough to only provide the abstract so that you could only gleam the summary; which if you knew how scientific research goes, can not be used to fully gleam what the study shows.</p>

<p>3.Not a scientific paper. This is a summary of other papers. This is of course biased as the authors can push what they want to summarize in each section by leaving out what&#39;s important. Found here: <a href="http://bit.ly/1G4bXrg">http://bit.ly/1G4bXrg</a></p>

<p>4.This was a good study but limitations they point out, and if you get to read it will see that the confounder of parental baseline mercury levels were not ascertained. It also should be noted that if you know anything about volume in infants and preborns, they&#39;re different. So by saying a volume of mercury is different/higher in one over the other doesn&#39;t mean shit, because duh it is! Found here: <a href="http://bit.ly/1L7vSwX">http://bit.ly/1L7vSwX</a></p>

<p>5.Good study, and it should not even be in this list. The results showed it remained within safe values. Found here: <a href="http://bit.ly/1Kwvp3T">http://bit.ly/1Kwvp3T</a></p>

<p>6.This study just shows that mercurial values ranged from 4-21ng/mL. Yet again can&#39;t access this one, thanks OP. Not sure about limitations but if I were to surmise, the parent&#39;s mercurial levels were not taken and then because this was a retrospective chart review, it can be biased off of reliance on the nurse to record data accurately.</p>

<p>7.Refer back to 1 and 2 for why this is a poor study.</p>

<p>8.This study merely shows an association of porphyria and unknown toxins in the environment. A poor study to base mercury poisoning on. Found here: <a href="http://bit.ly/1WkiO9u">http://bit.ly/1WkiO9u</a></p>

<p>9.A review article, not research. It doesn&#39;t provide any evidence towards mercury poisoning. It only goes to say there may be an environmental factor. I didn&#39;t have access to this journal. I just used reading comprehension to get that result. Found here: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21299355">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21299355</a></p>

<p>10.This study was in mouse models. Although semi like humans in physiology, they are notorious for not being accurate to scaling to humans. Nevertheless this study was well done. I thorough enjoyed reading it. If anything you can say this is the only one that may point to some kind of issue with mercury; but, the major limitation is whether this actually does anything negative in mice. That&#39;s another study that I&#39;m sure exists somewhere, likely the same authors. Study found here: <a href="http://1.usa.gov/1OvFoum">http://1.usa.gov/1OvFoum</a></p>

<p>11.Mice models again, and extremely high concentrations of 38.4–76.8 mg/kg. Let that sink in how much mercury that is in a human. The average human male is 70kg or 154lbs. That&#39;s 2.7g - 5.37g of mercury. (technically half that) That&#39;s a ridiculous and absurd amount. I don&#39;t have access to this journal either; but, reading comprehension is key.</p>

<p>12.Monkey models, was comparing levels of mercury in brains of monkeys. Not reliable to say this is the same for humans. It doesn&#39;t go into detail of what toxic effects are seen as that wasn&#39;t the intent of this study.</p>

<p>That&#39;s 12 of 30. I have refuted 12 of 30 of your studies that you are saying cause either autism or that vaccines are not safe. NONE of these studies have clear causation of damage associated with vaccines, NONE. The ones, such as 1 and 2, only show association. If you know anything whatsoever about bio statistics CAUSALITY =/ CAUSATION. You can show association between anything and say that x causes y off of it. For instance, I can say that because OP posts on the internet he is going to die; therefore the internet is going to kill OP. Does that make sense? No but you see that shit all the time with studies that try to use associations or look for associations. There can be a multitude of detrimental causes that are never reported in these studies that are the real causative agent for &quot;X&quot; Disease. Autism definetly cause be caused by chemicals, such as alcohol or drug abuse, but do you see that in these studies? No. Not at all. </p>

<p>Another thing: number 29, by a Mr. DeLonga. Where is her degree from and what&#39;s it in? Oh shit she&#39;s a economics teacher, not even biologically related.</p>

<p>TLDR: The studies posted are refutable. Most do not have anything to do with toxicity. They are merely looking at levels of mercury or try to associate through use of poorly done studies to be definitive causation. Now you can down vote me to hell; but, the point I make remains. If you try to declare mercury causes autism, prove it through hard science. Not retrospective analysis of charts or surveys.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I forgot I was typing a response to a subreddit with no real scientific background. If a study had bias, as does survey studies tend to do. It doesn&#39;t make it a good study. Point 2 is not a &quot;metastudy&quot;. That&#39;s not a word. You are referring to a meta-analysis, which that is not.</p>

<p>As far as animal models go. They don&#39;t hold up until you do human research. There are tons of information and research with animals that look promising but don&#39;t hold on in humans.</p>

<p>When I say can&#39;t access. I was literally using my ability to log into those databases or journals with what I have, a login. You don&#39;t have one. So I can read more than the abstract on 90% of journals since I have the ability to do so. I guess you can try to find out where/what field I&#39;m in if I have that ability.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is obvious that you looked at these studies with the intent of discrediting them.  </p>

<p>Here is some nice reading that you might want to apply next time you get on the internet for the express purpose of disproving something you disagree with.</p>

<p>Common Mistakes in Applying the Scientific Method</p>

<p><strong>The scientific method attempts to minimize the influence of the scientist&#39;s bias on the outcome of an experiment.</strong> That is, when testing an hypothesis or a theory, the scientist may have a preference for one outcome or another, and it is important that this preference not bias the results or their interpretation. The most fundamental error is to mistake the hypothesis for an explanation of a phenomenon, without performing experimental tests. Sometimes &quot;common sense&quot; and &quot;logic&quot; tempt us into believing that no test is needed. There are numerous examples of this, dating from the Greek philosophers to the present day.</p>

<p><strong>Another common mistake is to ignore or rule out data which do not support the hypothesis.</strong> Ideally, the experimenter is open to the possibility that the hypothesis is correct or incorrect. Sometimes, however, a scientist may have a strong belief that the hypothesis is true (or false), or feels internal or external pressure to get a specific result. In that case, there may be a psychological tendency to find &quot;something wrong&quot;, such as systematic effects, with data which do not support the scientist&#39;s expectations, while data which do agree with those expectations may not be checked as carefully. The lesson is that all data must be handled in the same way.</p>

<p>Another common mistake arises from the failure to estimate quantitatively systematic errors (and all errors). There are many examples of discoveries which were missed by experimenters whose data contained a new phenomenon, but who explained it away as a systematic background. Conversely, there are many examples of alleged &quot;new discoveries&quot; which later proved to be due to systematic errors not accounted for by the &quot;discoverers.&quot;</p>

<p>In a field where there is active experimentation and open communication among members of the scientific community, the biases of individuals or groups may cancel out, because experimental tests are repeated by different scientists who may have different biases. In addition, different types of experimental setups have different sources of systematic errors. Over a period spanning a variety of experimental tests (usually at least several years), a consensus develops in the community as to which experimental results have stood the test of time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A good amount of these articles claim mercury (thimerosal) is the cause of these issues. We no longer use mercury in our vaccines for children due to the health risk it posses for them and I also believe it is or almost is never used in adults vaccines (<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/thimerosal/">http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/thimerosal/</a>). So I wouldn&#39;t be too concerned about those studies anymore.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;thimerosal is still used in some flu vaccines. Yearly flu vaccines are recommended for all children.  If you are worried about thimerosal, you can ask for a flu vaccine without it.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>As for the other vaccines, they have Aluminum in which is even more toxic than Mercury</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t even read any of these studies in depth. You accept what you see as fact and then claim after the fact that I&#39;m the shill for blindly following? You probably don&#39;t even know what biases come about from retrospective studies. Nor do you know what the differences are in prospective and retrospective. I read papers daily, you? You don&#39;t. You see a title and immediately latch on like you have with all of those 100+ studies that put out there like their fact.</p>
