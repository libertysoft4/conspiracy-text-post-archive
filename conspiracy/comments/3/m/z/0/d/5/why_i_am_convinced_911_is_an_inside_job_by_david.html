        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The events of 9/11 were huge. The body of evidence that the administration, or other agencies within the US government, were involved is also huge. The problem with summarizing the information is that the scale of the operation and its cover-up are so vast. Finding smoking guns is like picking up litter on a field.
It&#39;s hard to move in a straight line. That makes it hard to create a simple narrative.</p>

<p>My personal questioning of the events of 9/11 began a few years later, when my sister went to a 9/11 conference and brought back books, DVDs, and enthusiasm. I watched the DVDs and became especially fascinated with one clip where the North Tower appeared to be literally erupting as it fell. One streamer caught my eye because I was able to follow its trajectory. I did some simple measurements right on the TV screen and estimated that the horizontal ejection velocity of that
stream of debris was around 60 mi/hr. These ejections of material were from high in the building. How could heavy steel members be thrown sideways so fast
when even the downward collapse had not picked up very much speed? This did not seem to me to be consistent with a purely gravitational collapse. I was
hooked. I started using some video analysis tools I use in my teaching to analyze the motions of various ejecta and the buildings themselves.
Several videos of the collapse of both towers show waves of horizontal mass ejections that race down the faces of the buildings, nearly keeping pace with
material falling outside the building, well below the zone of destruction itself. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atSd7mxgsGY">(YouTube: South Tower Coming Down and Race with Gravity.)</a></p>

<p>The ejections appear to come from many floors at the same time, which is inconsistent with the idea that the ejections consisted of debris blown out floor-by-floor as the floors pancaked together. In addition to the massive waves of ejections there are many photographs and videos showing individual, focused, high-speed ejections of material many floors below the point of collapse. These are easily explained as explosive ejections. They are not convincingly explained as escaping jets of compressed air. </p>

<p>The lack of sufficient cause for the collapse has been thoroughly documented, disputed, rationalized, and obfuscated. The jet fuel would have burned off within the first ten minutes. Most of the fuel burned up in a fireball outside the building, especially in the case of the South Tower where the plane mostly missed the core columns. The fires in the buildings, beyond the first few minutes, were essentially office fires, and not very large ones at that, ignited by the jet fuel, like
lighter fluid on charcoal. Jet fuel is kerosene. Temperatures from either kerosene or office fires are insufficient to melt, or even catastrophically weaken, the
massive steel columns running up the core of the building. Even if the flames and air temperature were maximally hot, the large mass of steel would wick away the
heat and not raise the steel temperature sufficiently. For the steel temperature to come close to the air temperature the fires would have to be of long duration, but these fires were very brief, on the order of an hour.... </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>Building 7</em></strong> The first time I saw it on YouTube, my jaw literally hit my chest and stayed there for about 15 minutes, while I tried to fit the official narrative within what I saw with my own eyes. I didn&#39;t succeed, the laws pf physics doesn&#39;t allow it. That was when I realized there was something fishy about the whole 9-11 incident.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>WTC 1-2</em></strong> The buildings both collapsed in less than 12 seconds, free fall speed is 9.8 seconds, which means only 20% of the kinetic energy was spend crush and disintegrate the whole structure. Beyond absurd. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>I am a man who praises himself of looking at the evidence. I like science and literature. I take the laws of nature and forefront academic knowledge into account before I make my conclusions. I am not afraid to ask or admit when I am unable to draw the correct conclusion.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The corporate owned mass media is willing to either censor or run a smear campaign against anyone who challenges the official narrative. This includes Reddit. You won&#39;t get any help for the mass media, despite mounting and readily available evidence.</p></li>
<li><p>The intelligence community and the government remains silent, despite mounting evidence of their involvement.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This post will get vote capped and trolled, just like the all the other posts about the 9-11 attack. Censorship within Reddit is rife and widespread, if you trespass into the realm of the intelligence community or the corporate elite and their political henchmen.</p>

<p>The wings of a 757 are hollow and made of aluminum. Take some sheet aluminum, fashion it into a wing shape and slam it into a cinderblock. Let us know how much damage you can do to said cinderblock.</p>

<p>Otherwise, I&#39;m with you. The jetfuel/kerosene is more of an oil, similar to diesel, and should burn for a bit, but not very long. It likely started secondary fires, but none of those fuels could burn extremely hot. Lack of air seems very likely making any serious damage from fire seem very unlikely. You wouldn&#39;t expect any real fire weakening of structural steel caused by the burning fuel sources present within only an hour&#39;s time.</p>

<p>did some measurements right on the TV screen </p>

<p>You realise you need the real distance and all that to get actual results right ? This is the stupid is post till now.  You also need many other real values and measurements.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those values are irrelevant in a simple velocity calculation. think about it, all you need to calculate velocity (in this case, miles per hour) all you need is a measurement of distance(calculated by a ratio of actual distance vs tv screen distance) and a measurement of time (in seconds converted to hours)</p>

<p>Uh...yea...the planes hit just short of an hour before the first tower collapsed. Are you completely ignorant of the events that took place on 9/11?</p>

<p>Bruh. Even better. I watched it while it happened!</p>
