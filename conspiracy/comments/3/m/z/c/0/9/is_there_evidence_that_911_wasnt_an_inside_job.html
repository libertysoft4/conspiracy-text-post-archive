    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely.</p>

<p>Evidence of planes crashing into buildings, phone calls from planes describing hijackers, hijackers on planes connected to plot that included flight training, etc. Admission from the alleged perpetrators themselves. Engineering report explaining collapse widely accepted by major American Engineering organizations. Etc.</p>

<p>But there is also some evidence, as many here will be quick to point out, that may point to an inside job. They may also have issues with evidence presented by the other side.</p>

<p>The real question is not whether the evidence exists, but how valid and relevant it is to the truth. That is where the debate is. For example, evidence from firefighter testimony indicates explosions prior to WTC7 collapse. Inside job proponents will say these are explosive charges, others may point to the fact that there are other things that may be explosive in large buildings. </p>

<p>I am fully aware that 911 truth advocates have these problems with the evidence put forward and advocated by &quot;outside jobbers&quot; (I despise the term &quot;official story&quot;, if my avoidance of the term wasn&#39;t enough evidence for that!

I certainly don&#39;t think so. But when I see that, I can&#39;t help but favor the side held by most academics, especially considering the low output of any model or peer reviewable paper from the 911 truth movement.

<p>Interesting point you&#39;re raising here, I&#39;d enjoy an in-depth discussion about that angle - here or at a later point.

<p>I see what you mean. What, do you suggest, would be a good, strong argument against it? Other than pointing out that there is not really such a professional support, more of a pact of silence not to address the collapse mode itself, as if it is enough to fabricate one hypotheses for the initiation after the other until nobody asks about the collapse mode itself anymore? </p>

<p>I tried the &quot;seventy years ago, there was professional support for the idea that it is obvious from the cranial features of Mongols, apes and Africans that the Aryan race is destined to rule the world&quot; and &quot;five hundred years ago, there was professional support for the hypothesis that the earth is the center of the universe&quot; angles. Experts can be wrong. The expert consensus has been wrong. Science has been politicized before (see: Wikipedia:Lysenko). Does the argument boil down to &quot;butbut not in OUR free and democratic country&quot;? </p>

<p>(&quot;Our&quot; country including me, as a German, too, chancellor Gerhard Schröder declared me American after 9/11, so if you&#39;re Canadian, that includes you as well as subject of the &quot;free world&quot;/Natoland). </p>

<p>Not just that; I repeatedly challenged both the author of the list and others who reposted/referred to it to pick one article/paper they understand. The author, btw, stated that comparing the structure to a spring is &quot;dumber than dogshit&quot; - he clearly never read even the first paper on his list, which features, prominently, an illustration of a mass m dropping from height h on a spring with stiffness C. Not just that, I went through the whole list and cleaned it up to feature only those items which explain the collapse mode itself (and are not paywalled). Not just that, I emailed the authors of the first three items on the list and asked them for clarification on a few issues. </p>

<p>Hm. Which ones do you refer to specifically? </p>

<blockquote>

<p>It does seem so, I agree, at a cursory glance. Once you start digging deeper and refuse to be blindsided by the many attempts at explaining how hot the fires were, how collapse initiated and concentrate on the question how science explains that a tower falls straight down through and out of itself when its top 1/4 falls on its lower 3/4, you&#39;ll basically end up with the Bazant/Zhou/Verdure/Le/Greening series of papers, which make no secret of the fact that they were explicitly written with <em>the stated aim</em> to prove that the towers must have collapsed under assumptions most favorable towards survival of the structure and do so in the way seen. The whole trick? W[g] &gt; W[p]: the towers, on every millimeter height on average, were heavier than they could support by an order of magnitude (ü=g-F/m), hence, global collapse was &quot;inevitable&quot;. </p>

<p>That&#39;s it, basically. You don&#39;t have to be an expert for that, high school physics should suffice. </p>

<p>I see where you&#39;re coming from, so please help me find the weak spot in that line of reasoning. Would 9/11 Truth be more true if the movement managed to smuggle more papers into &quot;respectable journals&quot;? Would respectable journals not be less respectable once they began peddling &quot;conspiracy theories&quot;? How would laypeople, who never questioned or studied the &quot;official science&quot;, and stick to it merely due to &quot;gut feeling&quot; and appeal to majority (or like me, for the first ten (!!) years, just don&#39;t want to be lunatic paranoid conspiracy theorists), be motivated to actually understand and compare the arguments put forth by both sides of the debate - and assess their veracity, reason and logic? Whip them until they come up with an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caATBZEKL4c">experiment</a> that proves Bazant right, in the spirit of Feynman: &quot;if it disagrees with experiment, it&#39;s wrong!&quot;?</p>

<p>I honestly don&#39;t understand you here. Why would you have to be an engineer, or how qualified do you have to be, to make the following observation: </p>

<p>Although titled <em>&quot;Final Report <strong>on the Collapse</strong> of the World Trade Center Towers&quot;</em>, NIST NCSTAR 1 does not treat the Twin Tower&#39;s complete top-down collapse mode at all and explicitly says so:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The specific objectives were:</p>

<ol>
<li>Determine why and how WTC 1 and WTC 2 collapsed following the initial impacts of the aircraft [...]</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.nist.gov/el/disasterstudies/wtc/wtc_finalreports.cfm">NIST NCSTAR 1</a>, p. xxxix</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>The focus of the investigation was on the sequence of events from the instant of aircraft impact to the initiation of collapse for each tower. For brevity in this report, this sequence is referred to as the ‘probable collapse sequence,’ although it includes little analysis of the structural behaviour of the tower after the conditions for collapse initiation were reached and collapse became inevitable.</p>

<p>NFPA 921 is online too. It says: look for exotic accelerants, whether you heard or saw something or not. NIST explicitly states they did not do that: &quot;<a href="http://www.nist.gov/el/disasterstudies/wtc/faqs_wtctowers.cfm">NIST did not test for the residue of these compounds in the steel.</a>.&quot; Because nobody heard nothing - except those who did, but we all know how unreliable eyewitness testimony is. Clearly, NIST violated an important protocol. And even if NFPA 921 did not exist: the least NIST should be accused of is lack of scientific curiosity in this instance alone. It must certainly be wondered what you have to be an expert at to make a clear statement about the quality of NISTs investigation: they obfuscated the simple fact that they have no idea what allowed the Twins to behave the way they did. </p>

<p>What I meant by that comment is that the term is an appeal to an idealogy (anti-authoritian) that essentially draws the discussion away from a fact based one and into an idealogical realm. Essentially, people don&#39;t want to think of themselves as &quot;sheep&quot; or &quot;followers&quot;, so by referring to the academically agreed upon explanation of events as the official story, the term is priming individuals against believing it. Of course, language use can go the other way as well, by referring to the &quot;unofficial story&quot; as a crazy conspiracy theory etc.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The way to fight against it would be to actually provide evidence of a &quot;pact of silence&quot;, or give these people who are supposedly covering it up the incentive or motivation to reveal themselves. Scientists and engineers are often pretty fact obsessed people, I have a hard time believing that of the hundreds of thousands of civil engineers in this country, only a small handful (most of AE911&#39;s experts are not civil engineers, and even if they were, the number is still extremely small) would speak out about such an important surpression of knowledge. Until you have proof of such a &quot;pact&quot;, all you really have is speculation in service of preserving a narrative.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Experts can be wrong. The expert consensus has been wrong</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And what proved the old science wrong? Newer, better science. That is what the 911 truth movement has failed to produce. There have been a tonne of assertions, but very little actual scientific literature. There has been essentially zero scientific literature related to the engineering side of the issue. You can&#39;t even claim that efforts are being blackballed, because no comprehensive engineering report has even been developed to be rejected yet. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hm. Which ones do you refer to specifically? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>They are listed in the link... off the top, MIT and the ASCE are pretty big ones.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s it, basically. You don&#39;t have to be an expert for that, high school physics should suffice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t agree. I think you have simplified a complex engineering question to such a degree that you feel comfortable reaching a conclusion without having to refer to actual experts. Boiling the construction of a building down to &quot;its top 1/4 falls on its lower 3/4&quot;, you are ignoring some many aspects of the collapse it renders itself meaningless. You are essentially throwing out the fact that buildings are a massive series of connections and support beams and referring to the towers as homogenous masses. You can&#39;t do that and expect engineers to listen to you. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Would 9/11 Truth be more true if the movement managed to smuggle more papers into &quot;respectable journals&quot;? Would respectable journals not be less respectable once they began peddling &quot;conspiracy theories&quot;?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When evidence is strong enough to prove the prevailing theory incorrect, it ceases to be a fringe or conspiracy theory and becomes the prevailing theory itself. I know it is common to accuse basically the entire academic system of being corrupt, but the fact is that there are millions of structural engineers around the world and likely hundreds of thousands in countries that aren&#39;t exactly sympathetic to the wants or needs of the United States government. Real science wins out when you can effectively convince honest scientists of the conclusions. I refuse to believe that only a fraction of a fraction of a percent of the engineering community is honest and not willing to ignore bad science.

<p>Whip them until they come up with an experiment that proves Bazant right, in the spirit of Feynman: &quot;if it disagrees with experiment, it&#39;s wrong!&quot;?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m sorry, but that experiment literally proves nothing. Believe it or not, washers and cardboard circles don&#39;t have the same structural makeup as a 110 story building. I mean, the square-cube law alone makes it invalid. It also technically invalidates your assertions earlier. If we are to take your assertions that the upper quarter of an object cannot destroy a larger mass below it, why were those washers able to squish more than 50% more than their own mass. 4 washers and supports destroy 7 levels below. Its almost as if physics is more complicated than originally asserted.</p>

<p>I won&#39;t go through the last bit piece by piece. I understand that the NIST report covers until collapse is deemed inevitable. I don&#39;t have an issue with this, personally, because I&#39;ve yet to see any convincing evidence that explosives would be needed for the falling section of building to break the connections and crush the supports of the floors directly below it, continuing until complete destruction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, if I were unable to prove it, and I really wanted a new beer, I would be forced to take action and take greater means to prove there is piss in my beer by following the testing standards of academic beer piss testers. If after 14 years I am unable to prove this, I may have to face reality that maybe it wasn&#39;t piss and instead just a Pabst. Maybe I&#39;d learn that no matter how convinced I was of my initial claims, sometimes beer just tastes like piss, even when it isn&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because there was some disappointment that I did not address the other points: I found it <em>shocking</em>, <em>disgusting</em>, <em>revolting</em> how <a href="/u/worksfortheNWO">/u/worksfortheNWO</a> first pretended to be familiar with the arguments put forward by opponents of &quot;outside job theories&quot; and then so blatantly misrepresented them. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The way to fight against it would be to actually provide evidence of a &quot;pact of silence&quot;, or give these people who are supposedly covering it up the incentive or motivation to reveal themselves. Scientists and engineers are often pretty fact obsessed people, I have a hard time believing that of the hundreds of thousands of civil engineers in this country, only a small handful (most of AE911&#39;s experts are not civil engineers, and even if they were, the number is still extremely small) would speak out about such an important surpression of knowledge. Until you have proof of such a &quot;pact&quot;, all you really have is speculation in service of preserving a narrative.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After he was shown, in no uncertain terms, straight from the donkey&#39;s ass, that there is no official explanation for the collapse and the whole inevitability hypothesis hinges on a paper submitted to ASCE two days after the attacks, which has never been taken seriously by the engineering community, and all alleged scientific support for the official theory concentrates on how hot the fires were, how long they burned and how much they weakened the steel because the fireproofing fell off - the <em>initiation</em>, not the collapse sequence itself. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And what proved the old science wrong? Newer, better science. That is what the 911 truth movement has failed to produce. There have been a tonne of assertions, but very little actual scientific literature. There has been essentially zero scientific literature related to the engineering side of the issue.  You can&#39;t even claim that efforts are being blackballed, because no comprehensive engineering report has even been developed to be rejected yet. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If he doesn&#39;t know better, he&#39;s ignorant, if he does, he&#39;s a liar. But he&#39;s also drinking piss for beer if enough experts tell him there&#39;s no piss in his beer because sometimes, beer just tastes like piss. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think you have simplified a complex engineering question to such a degree that you feel comfortable reaching a conclusion without having to refer to actual experts. Boiling the construction of a building down to &quot;its top 1/4 falls on its lower 3/4&quot;, you are ignoring some many aspects of the collapse it renders itself meaningless. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here, <a href="/u/worksfortheNWO">/u/worksfortheNWO</a> proves he&#39;s just another guy trusting scientists blindly instead at least reading over their papers because this is exactly Bazants - and hence, the only officially scientific - model: a top block weighing 58000 tons free falling one floor&#39;s height on the rest. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are essentially throwing out the fact that buildings are a massive series of connections and support beams and referring to the towers as homogenous masses. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And here he shows he has no grasp on concepts such as &quot;model&quot;, &quot;abstraction&quot;, &quot;simplification&quot;, &quot;approximation&quot;, &quot;approach&quot;. If he suggested a better model, fine. But he doesn&#39;t. He leans back, hoping nobody notices he will never be satisfied until the towers are modeled like huge Rube-Goldberg machines, because skyscrapers are <em>complicated</em>. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>When evidence is strong enough to prove the prevailing theory incorrect, it ceases to be a fringe or conspiracy theory and becomes the prevailing theory itself. I know it is common to accuse basically the entire academic system of being corrupt, but the fact is that there are millions of structural engineers around the world and likely hundreds of thousands in countries that aren&#39;t exactly sympathetic to the wants or needs of the United States government. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What&#39;s the prevailing theory in, say, Iran then?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Real science wins out when you can effectively convince honest scientists of the conclusions. I refuse to believe that only a fraction of a fraction of a percent of the engineering community is honest and not willing to ignore bad science. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And this sentence here basically sums up the reason why discussion would be fruitless. He <em>refuses to believe</em>! Well, then. A man&#39;s belief is his celestial kingdom, as we say in my language. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think that rather 911 truth theories are not strong enough (yet, that may change, and this is when I find myself a 911 truther again).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A coward who is afraid to stand up for his own convictions; an insecure, spineless little man waiting for experts to tell him he&#39;s drinking piss instead of beer, who does not even have enough confidence to order a new beer if in doubt - incompetence as a shield to hide behind! In short, the essence of all that is wrong with our world, the apotheosis of learned helplessness and externalized thinking, and the prime reason why we can&#39;t have good things. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m sorry, but that experiment literally proves nothing. Believe it or not, washers and cardboard circles don&#39;t have the same structural makeup as a 110 story building. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No shit, Sherlock.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I mean, the square-cube law alone makes it invalid. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another one from the Size-Matters-Law camp here. The towers were big, so they were allowed to fall through themselves, although all other buildings at all other scales fall over or arrest collapse. Just a claim with no backup whatsoever. Meh. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It also technically invalidates your assertions earlier. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Progression of collapse is arrested, so no. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If we are to take your assertions that the upper quarter of an object cannot destroy a larger mass below it, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not my assertion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>why were those washers able to squish more than 50% more than their own mass. 4 washers and supports destroy 7 levels below. Its almost as if physics is more complicated than originally asserted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What was originally asserted?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I won&#39;t go through the last bit piece by piece. I understand that the NIST report covers until collapse is deemed inevitable. I don&#39;t have an issue with this, personally, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>He doesn&#39;t personally have an issue with that. But he doesn&#39;t have an issue with his beer tasting like piss either, so there&#39;s that. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>because I&#39;ve yet to see any convincing evidence that explosives would be needed for the falling section of building to break the connections and crush the supports of the floors directly below it, continuing until complete destruction.</p>

<p>It is often a sign of a weak argument when someone uses a logical fallacy. Fixed that for you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So fucking dense. I am not arguing about the goddamn VOC spikes paper.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I never made this claim. Reading comprehension is key, remember? You came to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, arguing against a conspiracy. I gave you information you can&#39;t refute. And now you&#39;re getting upset. But you came here to argue. And you got an argument. Deal with it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m telling you to stop insisting you&#39;ve proved some sort of point when I&#39;ve been clear that I am not refuting it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn&#39;t prove the point. The peer reviewed, published authors did. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ya, who exactly peer reviewed it? Because the company that runs the journal it is published in has a really, really bad reputation.[1] </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The journal in which the paper is published is not listed in your article. A weak attempt at a refutation. Following the standard MO of attempting to attack the journal rather than the information. And you didn&#39;t even succeed at that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>We</strong> reported this to the Committee on Publishing Ethics (COPE) immediately. Attempts to manipulate peer review have affected journals <strong>across a number of publishers</strong> as detailed by COPE in their December 2014 statement. <strong>Springer</strong> has made COPE aware of the findings of <strong>its own internal investigations and has followed COPE’s recommendations,</strong> as outlined in their statement, for dealing with this issue. Springer will continue to participate and do whatever we can to support COPE’s efforts in this matter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Looks like Springer dealt with the issue. The journal the paper is published in was never on the original list. And the paper remains published. Don&#39;t tell me you also don&#39;t understand how the peer review process works? You do know that each journal has a separate board, correct? Weak. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If a pro-official story paper was published in that journal, I&#39;d bet you&#39;d loose your shit over those fake reviews.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are no fake reviews of the journal/paper I provided you. And I&#39;d love to see a published refutation of the paper I gave you. So far though, no such luck. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Despite your insane ramblings and accusations,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Peer reviewed, published science = insanity? No.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the research has peaked my curiosity and I&#39;d like to see reviews from experts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It has been reviewed by experts. As it is a peer reviewed, published paper. You mean you&#39;d like to see a refutation. So would I. But again, no such luck.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Again, who?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t work for the journal. Go contact the editorial board and ask them for the names of the peer reviewers if you like.</p>

<p>Springer is not the journal. The journal is Environment Systems and Decisions (previously the Environmentalist) You need to do your research on understanding how this works. Each journal has it&#39;s own editorial board. They are not related. And again, if you&#39;re making the claim that the journal faked the review, you need to prove it. Which you have failed to do.

<p>I heard your logical fallacy the first time. And I watched you fail at proving the the authors/reviewers of the paper aren&#39;t qualified. And I watched you fail at providing a refutation by those that are &quot;more qualified.&quot; </p>

Both of you exhibits reasons for downvoted, but I don&#39;t think either one of you are down voting for any reason other then you both think the other is wrong. Such as him being aggressive.</p>

<p>I followed and notice some flaws. If you mean you have a peer reviewedtu published paper, you do not mean AE9/11T? Because if it is, I would advice to not say that or use it as a source. The people behind it are very shady. (Disclaimer: This doesn&#39;t mean I do not believe in the conspiracy.) They have lied repeatedly. The little peer reviews they have is gained from unfair methods such as choosing the reviewers or doing the reviews for the peers. They also faked evidence. The major contributors alone sadly do not have any credibility such as Steve. </p>

<p>No,  the so called evidence needs to be investigated,  examined,  in a non-partial context.    Questioned.    Analyzed.    Studied.   Compared.    Physics applied.    </p>

<p>For all the conversations about 9/11,   the most lasting impression is that the official story is full of holes.     The truth movement has also been put on the defensive every time it has tried to come up with an alternate theory.     </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is a lot of response. I am going to try to be brief, both because I commented on this thread not intending to get into this type of discussion, and because I simply don&#39;t have the time to respond too indepth/research claims/etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Interesting point you&#39;re raising here, I&#39;d enjoy an in-depth discussion about that angle - here or at a later point. It seems more like a hen-egg problem to me... do you doubt the outside job narrative because you&#39;re antiauthoritarian or do you become antiauthoritarian because you doubt the outside job narrative?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What I meant by that comment is that the term is an appeal to an idealogy (anti-authoritian) that essentially draws the discussion away from a fact based one and into an idealogical realm. Essentially, people don&#39;t want to think of themselves as &quot;sheep&quot; or &quot;followers&quot;, so by referring to the academically agreed upon explanation of events as the official story, the term is priming individuals against believing it. Of course, language use can go the other way as well, by referring to the &quot;unofficial story&quot; as a crazy conspiracy theory etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I see what you mean. What, do you suggest, would be a good, strong argument against it? Other than pointing out that there is not really such a professional support, more of a pact of silence not to address the collapse mode itself, as if it is enough to fabricate one hypotheses for the initiation after the other until nobody asks about the collapse mode itself anymore? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The way to fight against it would be to actually provide evidence of a &quot;pact of silence&quot;, or give these people who are supposedly covering it up the incentive or motivation to reveal themselves. Scientists and engineers are often pretty fact obsessed people, I have a hard time believing that of the hundreds of thousands of civil engineers in this country, only a small handful (most of AE911&#39;s experts are not civil engineers, and even if they were, the number is still extremely small) would speak out about such an important surpression of knowledge. Until you have proof of such a &quot;pact&quot;, all you really have is speculation in service of preserving a narrative.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Experts can be wrong. The expert consensus has been wrong</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And what proved the old science wrong? Newer, better science. That is what the 911 truth movement has failed to produce. There have been a tonne of assertions, but very little actual scientific literature. There has been essentially zero scientific literature related to the engineering side of the issue. You can&#39;t even claim that efforts are being blackballed, because no comprehensive engineering report has even been developed to be rejected yet. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hm. Which ones do you refer to specifically? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>They are listed in the link... off the top, MIT and the ASCE are pretty big ones.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s it, basically. You don&#39;t have to be an expert for that, high school physics should suffice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t agree. I think you have simplified a complex engineering question to such a degree that you feel comfortable reaching a conclusion without having to refer to actual experts. Boiling the construction of a building down to &quot;its top 1/4 falls on its lower 3/4&quot;, you are ignoring some many aspects of the collapse it renders itself meaningless. You are essentially throwing out the fact that buildings are a massive series of connections and support beams and referring to the towers as homogenous masses. You can&#39;t do that and expect engineers to listen to you. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Would 9/11 Truth be more true if the movement managed to smuggle more papers into &quot;respectable journals&quot;? Would respectable journals not be less respectable once they began peddling &quot;conspiracy theories&quot;?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When evidence is strong enough to prove the prevailing theory incorrect, it ceases to be a fringe or conspiracy theory and becomes the prevailing theory itself. I know it is common to accuse basically the entire academic system of being corrupt, but the fact is that there are millions of structural engineers around the world and likely hundreds of thousands in countries that aren&#39;t exactly sympathetic to the wants or needs of the United States government. Real science wins out when you can effectively convince honest scientists of the conclusions. I refuse to believe that only a fraction of a fraction of a percent of the engineering community is honest and not willing to ignore bad science. I think that rather 911 truth theories are not strong enough (yet, that may change, and this is when I find myself a 911 truther again).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whip them until they come up with an experiment that proves Bazant right, in the spirit of Feynman: &quot;if it disagrees with experiment, it&#39;s wrong!&quot;?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m sorry, but that experiment literally proves nothing. Believe it or not, washers and cardboard circles don&#39;t have the same structural makeup as a 110 story building. I mean, the square-cube law alone makes it invalid. It also technically invalidates your assertions earlier. If we are to take your assertions that the upper quarter of an object cannot destroy a larger mass below it, why were those washers able to squish more than 50% more than their own mass. 4 washers and supports destroy 7 levels below. Its almost as if physics is more complicated than originally asserted.</p>

<p>I won&#39;t go through the last bit piece by piece. I understand that the NIST report covers until collapse is deemed inevitable. I don&#39;t have an issue with this, personally, because I&#39;ve yet to see any convincing evidence that explosives would be needed for the falling section of building to break the connections and crush the supports of the floors directly below it, continuing until complete destruction.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I mean, if someone is pissing into your beer, do you study urology or become a master brewer before you feel confident enough to order a new beer?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have the qualifications necessary to judge whether or not there is piss in my beer (taste-buds and an unhealthy amount of experience in the field of beer tasting).</p>
