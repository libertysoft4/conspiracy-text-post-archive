        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>When one mentions propaganda, many people think of corny posters featuring a hammer and sickle or crudely edited North Korean videos glorifying Kim Jung-Un. Most Americans believe they are too smart and that the USA is too free for propaganda to ever work here. This is a grave error. </p>

<p>There are endless documented cases of propaganda issued by the central government. Like how the Pentagon edits many Hollywood scripts or how it is <a href="http://www.salon.com/2015/07/31/youre_watching_pentagon_propaganda_american_idol_ice_road_truckers_and_the_truth_about_your_favorite_shows/">deeply involved</a> with numerous reality television shows. </p>

<p>Indeed, back in July <a href="http://www.spyculture.com/docs/US/USArmy-EntertainmentLiaisonOffice-2010to2015reports.pdf">one of the largest Freedom of Information Act releases ever</a> dropped. The U.S. Army’s Entertainment Liaison Office was forced to release a 1,400 page document that details the Pentagon’s involvement with American movies and television shows between 2010 and 2015. This document details Pentagon meddling in shows as seemingly benign as Country Music’s Next Superstar and Top Chef Masters. The write up on Transformers III describes how Department of Defense officials met with Michael Bay on at least three occasions to go over the script and suggest necessary revisions. The document’s author states that Transformers III “will give us the opportunity to showcase the bravery and values of our Soldiers and the excellent technology of today’s Army to a global audience.” (p. 52) </p>

<p>The Defense Department paid <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/defense-department-paid-5-4-million-nfl-honor-troops/">$5.4 million</a> of taxpayer money to the NFL to spot light veterans and to show case soldiers on the field at half time. Imagine if you saw <a href="https://military.id.me/community-news/nfl-teams-up-with-veterans-groups-to-help-returning-heroes/">this</a> in North Korea instead of Minnesota.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird">Operation Mockingbird</a>, in which over 3,000 journalists in every form of media covertly worked for and often published stories directly written by the CIA from the 1950s to the 1970s. Mockingbird continues to this day, by the way. German journalist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udo_Ulfkotte#The_book_.22Bought_Journalists.22">Udo Ulfkotte</a> blew the whistle in 2014 when he revealed that it was understood journalists would lose their jobs if they wrote anything against the West. Indeed, many of the supposedly impartial &#39;experts&#39; you see on television are actually <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/20/us/20generals.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;">working for the Pentagon.</a> And CNN now airs &#39;news&#39; segments that are literally <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2015/06/08/cnn-courageous-branded-content-studio/">produced by corporations.</a> </p>

<p><strong>Psy Ops</strong> </p>

<p>To advance the corporate/government agenda, the mainstream media will sometimes engage in psychological warfare. For instance, after Iraq invaded Kuwait on August 2nd, 1990, the United States was itching to intervene, but had to give the public a credible reason to get behind the war. </p>

<p>Enter Nayirah: this fifteen year old girl blinked back tears as she gave a moving testimony about the horrible war crimes Iraq was committing in Kuwait. In front of the Congressional Human Rights Caucus, she famously stated, &quot;While I was there I saw the Iraqi soldiers come into the hospital with guns. They took the babies out of the incubators, took the incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor [crying.] It was horrifying&quot; (1, video linked below.) In the ensuing months, congressmen, T.V. personalities, and President Bush latched onto this testimony as a prime reason to enter the Iraq-Kuwait War. President Bush &quot;repeated the story at least ten times in the following weeks.&quot; (2). There was just one problem: the testimony was completely made up. </p>

<p>Two years later, The New York Times dropped a bombshell: Nayirah was in fact a member of the Kuwaiti Royal Family and the daughter of Kuwait&#39;s Ambassador to the US. It further came out that Nayirah had been coached by one of the largest public relations firms in the world at the time, Hill &amp; Knowlton. The firm&#39;s D.C. office was run by Craig Fuller, a George Bush crony who had served as Bush&#39;s chief-of-staff during his vice presidency. </p>

<p>Hill and Knowlton received $11 million from the Kuwaiti government to produce propaganda pieces that would help get the American public to support an invasion of Iraq. In addition to faking Nayirah&#39;s testimony, Hill and Knowlton &quot;produced dozens of video news releases&quot; which &quot; were shown by eager TV news directors around the world who rarely (if ever) identified Kuwait&#39;s PR firm as the source of the footage and stories.&quot; (3)</p>

<p><strong>Propaganda is Legal in the United States</strong></p>

<p>Propaganda pieces in the United States are often called &quot;Video News Releases.&quot; According to Wikipedia, a &quot;video news release (VNR) is a video segment made to look like a news report, but is instead created by a PR firm, advertising agency, marketing firm, corporation, or government agency. They are provided to television newsrooms to shape public opinion, promote commercial products and services, publicize individuals, or support other interests.&quot; (4) The <em>New York Times</em> reported in March, 2005 that &quot;In all, at least 20 federal agencies, including the Defense Department and the Census Bureau, have made and distributed hundreds of television news segments in the past four years...Many were subsequently broadcast on local stations across the country without any acknowledgement of the government&#39;s role in their production.&quot; (5) </p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>So it is all documented, but that is not the point of this post. Rather, I&#39;d like to point out that everyone is biased depending on what country they grew up in. 50s era Soviet propaganda may look laughably obvious to you, but that&#39;s because you have the benefit of hind sight and are coming from a different cultural context. Some one who grew up on a different planet may very well think the United States is a totalitarian society with North Korean levels of propaganda. </p>

<p>And here&#39;s the biggest mind-fuck of all: the masses, to some extent, actually <em>want</em> propaganda. Of course they want to live in the best country and have everything be black-and-white. Thinking is hard and scary. So is going to war and being a man (so we watch football.) So is approaching women and getting them to like you (so we watch porn.) So is researching how your country actually works and coming to completely different conclusions than your friends and family (so we repeat what they say on television.) </p>

<p>Propaganda comes both from the top-down and bottom-up. The herd wants and demands distractions, and the ruling elite is happy to provide them. Living in the United States is more of a mind fuck than most people could ever imagine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Propaganda doesn&#39;t necessarily mean something is false. For example, the most effective form of propaganda, mixes truths, half truths, and bold faced lies into one cohesive spiel (that you&#39;re likely to see). Propaganda simply aims to hold, or change (sometimes radically), opinions. It doesn&#39;t really matter how it gets there. Imo, propaganda can literally be pure truth, and that&#39;s hard to ignore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your point? The DPRK&#39;s government is both totalitarian and incredibly brutal. People are sent to concentration camps, along with three generations of their family, for even the tiniest infractions. The Kim family are worshipped as gods thanks to decades of propaganda. The entire country is essentially a real life version of George Orwell&#39;s 1984&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People in North Korea literally don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like in the rest of the world.  They&#39;re not allowed to see it.  They almost always speak of how shocked they are at the reality of the world outside Korea.</p>

<p>That and they&#39;re fucking literal slaves who are dying of starvation by the thousands, forced to watch their families tortured to death, forced into horrible manual labor for 18 hours a day.  And many of them still believe their leader is a God.</p>

<p>Americans are constantly screaming bloody murder about their leaders, about the military, about propaganda, about their brainwashed peers.  These things would get you killed in N. Korea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact you can say this out loud in this country completely negates your argument. The US does a lot of horrible things, but it does not kill huge number of citizens for speaking out. Does it use propaganda, of course. Are there terrible results of it, of course. Do we do terrible things to poor countries around the world? Of course. Are the American people as brainwashed and oppressed as the North Korean people? Not a fucking chance in hell. </p>

<p>You mean a priori knowledge.</p>

<ul>
<li>in Western philosophy since the time of Immanuel Kant, knowledge that is independent of all particular experiences</li>

<p>vs</p>

<p>a posteriori, or experienced knowledge</p>

<ul>
<li>only garnered from firsthand experience</li>

<p>Which one of these is your &quot;knowledge&quot; based on? What institutions convinced you? Was it CNN, Fox News, C-SPAN?!? Perhaps it was Wikipedia??? Snopes?!? The Koch Brothers and their PBS monopoly???</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh dear God. So much stupidity. Nothing you said had anything to do with the topic.</p>

<p>North Korea doesn&#39;t have internet. All outside media banned. Homes have speakers blaring propaganda all day that cannot be turned off. Every home has pictures of Kim family members that must be cleaned under the law. The DPRK is quite literally &quot;1984&quot;. </p>

<p>No one said America doesn&#39;t have propaganda. What was said (and what is true) is that the people of the DPRK are the most brainwashed by propaganda. Why? Because they have no access whatsoever to information other than that propaganda.</p>

<p>Tell me, does posting a wall of text make you feel superior to others? Well it shouldn&#39;t because your wall of text had nothing whatsoever to do with the argument. </p>

<p>Try reading a book sometime.</p>

<li>people take sports more seriously than politics</li>
<li>a Republican National Convention looks like a Superbowl party with sleazy politicians doing keg stands in the isles</li>
<li>we don&#39;t literally own our property</li>
<li>we actually think we&#39;re free</li>
<li>we suffer from learned helplessness</li>
<li>we&#39;re in a state of perpetual war</li>
<li>we spend a trillion dollars a year on war and &quot;defense&quot;</li>
<li><strong>all of our communications are monitored</strong></li>
<li></li>
</ul>

<p>The American populace is utterly subjugated. Virtually everyone in this nation has access to the open internet. Yet, we still don&#39;t have a serious grasp of deep politics. Most people couldn&#39;t care less. Just look at our priorities! Just look at freaking television! Most peoples opinions of the world are formed through TV.</p>

<p>Ask any American what the first think they think of is when they see an Arab (terrorist). Do you really think that accurate? Then why do we think that way? Why did it become a stigma to be intelligent? <strong>North Koreans have every right in the world to be as brainwashed as they are, Americans don&#39;t.</strong> In fact, we don&#39;t have ANY excuses.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right; we imprison way more people than the Soviets ever did. </p>

<p>And it&#39;s illegal. </p>

<p>Ummm it&#39;s run by the Feds and the Chicago police department. They <em>are</em> the law. By the way, &#39;legal&#39; and &#39;illegal&#39; is just decided by whoever is in power (read some Max Weber.) Taking these words seriously is akin to believing in Faith and Grace. </p>

<p>As for the black sites, they&#39;re operating illegally.  Just because it&#39;s done by the feds doesn&#39;t make it legal.  The drug running isn&#39;t legal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please read Edward Bernay&#39;s book called &#39;Propaganda&#39;. He is the father of it. It&#39;s a quick read and you can download a PDF version of it for free.</p>

<p>Most people do not understand what propaganda is, and this in and of itself is part of a propaganda campaign. Here is my short one sentence definition;</p>

<p>Propaganda; the insertion of an idea or thought into a target person/audience mind(s) in which they believe the idea or thought is their own creation.</p>

<p>Which, imo, is the very definition of mind control. It also means it would be difficult or impossible to know if you&#39;ve been propangandized, since you believe the &#39;thought&#39; is your own creation.</p>

<p>You therefor could argue that propaganda that one recognizes as such is bad propaganda. But not necessarily so. Think of it more like overt propaganda. Propaganda that you recognize as such most likely means that you are NOT the target audience. As poptart_fiend mentioned it is easy to recognize the propaganda of a different culture, from hindsight and being on the outside. It is much more difficult to recognize propaganda within your own culture. And if it is covert then it may be impossible to recognize propaganda if you are the target audience.</p>

<p>Do you want to avoid being &#39;propagandized&#39;? Turn off your TV, Radio, and frankly most of what is on the Internet. (Reddit has become a propaganda tool). These are all mind control devices, and have been used as such since their inception.</p>

<p>Good post poptart_fiend</p>
