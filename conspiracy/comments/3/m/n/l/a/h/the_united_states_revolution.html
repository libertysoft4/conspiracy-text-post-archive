        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>My fellow americans, my generation (1990+) wants change. We are afraid, we are not organized and many still remain blind to the realities of today. We are your family, your friends, your brothers in arms, and your future. Our fathers and grandfathers have labored harder than we have had to, to build what we have advanced and improved. We have more to fight for because of this, we also have wrongs we must right that have been passed down to us and will be left on our childrens shoulders if we do not right this now.  </p>

<p>We not only as americans but as Humanity, must break this vicious cycle of bondage. As things grow worse we will grow more dependant on our governments, our empires, our kingdoms. We as humanity must come together, not now but in the near to distant future. The fire that would fuel this burns in every human being, it is that feeling that burns you your entire life, What am i ment to do? What is my purpose? What am i required to do? You will not simply walk into it, you must take the initiative to give yourself one. </p>

<p>You may think, im free, im not obligated to do anything. Your wrong, the only thing protecting your freedom is you and your fellow man. Your obligations are only to us, Humanity. The United states revolution with as much influence as it has could stir the flames for this. Im not saying this will happen, im simply saying it could, regardless we need to make a change.</p>

<p>Earth can only sustain another 3 billion and we continue to waste (until we expand) resources that we cannot renew on our bickering nations. Im not saying war is unnecesary, on the contrary it is a very realy necessity, i.e. think of the holocaust, now mix that with the americans hitting north america vs the indians, this would be the situation, were we to face a greater threat than ourselves. We as humanity, will never live to see this unless we make the change now.</p>

<p>Our technology is strong enough that a single bomb could wipe a nation off the map. Yet we still have people starving in our own backyard. There are people just like you and me born into nothing with no way out.</p>

<p>I call on you not as friends nor americans but as my fellow Humans. So that our species may flourish throughout the stars and our many will not continue to die, fight wars, and struggle from the ignorance and greed of few, but for the freedom and life of the many, we must band together.</p>

<p>My fellow humans, you want to find your purpose? Give your bloodline,  and the entirety of the human race a chance at a future so that they may have the same opportunity to find theres. We want change and we are afraid, we are uncoordinated, we need the older generations to speak up so that the many who yet remain ignorant may open there eyes. We need help, we are lost.</p>

I just read this and the one other post you&#39;ve put on reddit, and I&#39;m very possibly moved (also confused about some of your assertions) – but what made/caused you to find this lowly subreddit of an unfamiliar site, and why did you chose to pen those posts here?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I browse reddit a lot and use to go to worldnews a lot until i found this now i go inbetween and just look at the thoughts that people have here on current events.  The thing mainly is that i just felt it needed to be said and many people when it comes to talking about what else could be going on and alternate motives that people can have are so blind to how cold the real world is that they just brush it off or are too afraid of what people that effect there everyday life will think. I am very passionate about this im a grown man, ive cried very little in my life but even typing this hurts. This isnt my main account to be clear, but all of you here come here for like minded people/alternative sources of info/ or maybe to express though freely. The reality is there are so many people who share your views that are too afraid to speak up or dont want to sound wierd or simply dont know where to acquire information. All throughout history weve had revolutions of politics, culture, etc. I feel its time for ours. Like i said everyone burns for a purpose and this is what i feel is mine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Word to all of that, and I hear you. Thanks for explaining. While everyone who is a legitimate subscriber to this subreddit is seeking to answer and address everything you&#39;ve written, there are many opinions and many people focused on the various arms of the octopus that strangle who we are as human beings. I greatly respect your outlining it as a &quot;human&quot; rather than a &quot;political&quot; or &quot;national&quot; problem, and I hope that those of your generation (and mine, right ahead of you) find their energy and cause in that. The Powers That Be (TPTB) want you to believe that your problems are with all the petty divisions of us – from race and geography to religion, gender, orientation and political party. Almost everything cultural and educational that we&#39;ve inherited is a contrivance that serves to mask the fact that we are a collection of sentient beings on a rock hurtling through space. The solutions will be found by all of you/us feeling hopeless about it and creating something new through that collective understanding + science, IMHO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes you have to embrace strange things, in my eyes theres not a good or a bad thing to do, theres a just an unjust, what you can justify to you is right and what you cant is wrong. People grow up in different areas where they are taught things are right so they themselves can justify it. Of course rules have to be set bet you have to be open to understanding other people and ways of life. Im not bias, i wish more people could be open minded.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For any new American revolution to go off in the fashion it needs to go off, people have a lot of learning to do. Like a whole college education entirely focused on three course tracks:</p>

<p>What went wrong</p>

<p>Lies we were told</p>

<p>What actually works</p>

<p>Frankly the global elites are going to hand us a revolution or already have, and that&#39;s not good. They&#39;re going to make it easy for us to shift to a one-world government either by war or by fake politics. They&#39;re going to do it ASAP in hopes to preempt an educated grassroots change.</p>

<p>The only hope of self-determination is to learn, learn, learn. And of course discuss, share, and the truly hard part: organize. Hard as lead because the community has been dashed in this country. Hi, my name is Jim Crow, and so&#39;s yours, and everyone else&#39;s. In fact we are all pretty much certifiable with multiple personality disorders and all the personalities are named Jim Crow.</p>

<p>Here is something awesome and indisputably helpful and very, very much on topic. Enjoy some free revolution university:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look at Occupy and Anonymous. It&#39;s happening. It&#39;s just very fragile and very, very much in the crosshairs. Guess how much of your tax dollars went into Pentagon think tanks to suppress it? They even tapped a few universities. Think about that. Thought control projects to prevent the appropriate reactions to our politics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s certainly a risk of that but it&#39;s far from absolute. The fact is that social systems help people when run by the community and they harm people when controlled by elites. With communities controlling things, one person simply cannot exercise the kind of power that appointees, electorates, etc can do. It&#39;s as simple as that. More people in control means operations serve the interests of a greater number of people and injustices are reduced because no voices are marginalized.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, I think many people want this &#39;revolutionary change&#39; you speak of, but the problems they are are many.  I can offer some talking points I feel are relevant:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>We have so much history at our fingertips that we have distilled it into an essence that is &#39;wise enough&#39; to demonstrate that we don&#39;t want any more bloody wars.  This is despite the fact that our alleged leaders embroil us within them in perpetuity (see DIA mural),</p></li>
<li><p>We as a human race but more specifically on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> are still reckoning a very long formula that would ultimately determine whether or not &quot;anyone is in charge&quot;, and if so, <em>who</em>?  The so-called <em>Jews</em>?  A fraternal cabal of egyptian alchemists?  The Pope?  The Queen?  Terence McKenna believed &quot;no one is in charge&quot;  (that it <em>truly is</em> a global free market). That would be seriously fucked up in its implications but it&#39;s also much less likely given the patterns we have see, esp. in <a href="/r/911truth">/r/911truth</a> but so many more confirmed conspiracies like gulf of tonkin and northwoods exist.  I believe one cannot move forward in revolutionary change without <em>first addressing and resolving human rights injustices against all humans on earth</em>, because otherwise revolutionary acts become at best, a tantrum akin to the completely diluted and failed messages of the Occupy Wall St movement, and at worst an opportunity for globalists to discredit, destroy the movement and any future related inklings (ie &quot;black lives (dont) matter&quot; false flag).  <em>In other words, 911 will become our escaton, unless we othello it and redeem the future.</em></p></li>
<li><p>In light of #1 and 2, our society has evolved into one that thinks thinks that technology will save us in the same way it has transformed our communication, and access to information.  This could be a trap; but we don&#39;t know yet.  We are driving using only the rear view mirror.</p></li>

Our technology intelligence and cooperation is the only thing that gives us an edge over everything else. Science and technology is taking us to places that i saw in sci fiovies growing up. Nanotechnology, gene editing, all the advances in medicine and fighting disease. Todays sci fi, could be tomorrows reality, we only know very little about the universe and the laws that apply to it, what we think impossible today could be common knowledge 20 </p>

<p>In reply to #2
If we dont start somewhere how can we do anything about the rest of the world? I do believe a system should be in place, a system that is similar to our current one but with a much larger percent of the population, and a board of top engineers and scientists similar to a technocracy. This wont be doable until Humanity bands together, otherwise there will always be fear of another nation taking advantage and stealing our tech/weapon knowledge that gives us the edge. We wont have to hide our technology and our knowledge if there isnt an opposing side.</p>

I believe one cannot move forward in revolutionary change without <em>first addressing and resolving human rights injustices against all humans on earth</em>, because otherwise revolutionary acts become at best, a tantrum akin to the completely diluted and failed messages of the Occupy Wall St movement, and at worst an opportunity for globalists to discredit, destroy the movement and any future related inklings (ie &quot;black lives (dont) matter&quot; false flag).  <em>In other words, 911 will become our escaton, unless we othello it and redeem the future.</em></p></li>
<li><p>In light of #1 and 2, our society has evolved into one that thinks thinks that technology will save us in the same way it has transformed our communication, and access to information.  This could be a trap; but we don&#39;t know yet.  We are driving using only the rear view mirror.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re headed in the right direction with a heavy load of clap trap baggage, a sincere heart and rather typical <em>angst</em> of youth.</p>

<p>Log off of reddit for a bit.  Go to your library and start reading some books. Check out books that lean towards your interests. A cook book, gardening, car repair,  can stimulate your receptors to seek other reading material that better addresses your thirst. Read more books!</p>

<p>Turn off your TV, cell phone, your local radio stations, mind-numbing entertainment... Try to walk about your location, home, work, school with fresh eyes, ears, tastes, smells. Give it a few days because it is weird but you&#39;ll feel a change.</p>

<p>There&#39;s every possibility that young ones like you will sort this shit show out! I&#39;m old and I&#39;ve fought many long years, without much success! </p>

<p>Perhaps one day my grandsons will have you to thank!</p>

It&#39;s effectively a &quot;how-to&quot; guide for building a government. If we have a revolution, we can&#39;t run from the past. We must be walking towards something... and the answer to all of our ills won&#39;t fit in a single essay or even a dozen, but it does fit nicely in about 120 pages... so read it and share it. There are no simple solutions, but there are solutions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I respect your post OP, but it is unfounded. The governments of Earth, not just the U.S., have taken this too far behind the scenes. I&#39;m convinced the best thing we can hope for would be either A) spiritual enlightenment at the point of death, in regards to having lived on such a dark, backwards planet or B) perhaps some truly benevolent gods or aliens can help us. However! We must use the UTMOST discernment when dealing with things we don&#39;t fully understand; a tall order for dim witted Homo sapiens. There are many deceivers. As for our generation? Good luck getting them to drop their snapchats and facebooks and the feeling of being the own celebrity so that they can &quot;stick it to the man&quot; with you. Believe me buddy, I&#39;ve tried. The masses will not react until it&#39;s in their own faces, and at that point it will be too late for them. Help, if you can; but most importantly; learn. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Word to all of that, and I hear you. Thanks for explaining. While everyone who is a legitimate subscriber to this subreddit is seeking to answer and address everything you&#39;ve written, there are many opinions and many people focused on the various arms of the octopus that strangle who we are as human beings. I greatly respect your outlining it as a &quot;human&quot; rather than a &quot;political&quot; or &quot;national&quot; problem, and I hope that those of your generation (and mine, right ahead of you) find their energy and cause in that. The Powers That Be (TPTB) want you to believe that your problems are with all the petty divisions of us – from race and geography to religion, gender, orientation and political party. Almost everything cultural and educational that we&#39;ve inherited is a contrivance that serves to mask the fact that we are a collection of sentient beings on a rock hurtling through space. The solutions will be found by all of you/us feeling hopeless about it and creating something new through that collective understanding + science, IMHO.</p>
