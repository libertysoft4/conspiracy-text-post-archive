    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s only in the past year that I&#39;ve woken up to how much corruption there really is in the world, and that brought me here looking for answers as to why... and while there has been plenty of good info and interesting theories on this sub I&#39;m so glad September 23 is over because that means I can finally feel confident that all of this doomsday talk is bullshit. It&#39;s not that I believed anything too serious would happen, but I was too fresh to this nonsense to completely wipe it as being a possibility... now I feel like I can.</p>

<p>Those that peddle this crap should be ashamed, all it does is take away from real issues and scare people.</p>

I&#39;ll probably hang around here for a few more days and see the 28th come and go as a 3rd strike for bullshit, then move on.</p>
