<p>All of us who enjoy this place need to make a concerted effort to start down voting and commenting on this.  Someone has organized agains r/conspiracy to keep this bullshit coming strong, so we need organize amongst ourselves to combat this attack.</p>

<p>The best we can do is make our feelings known with our votes, and for those of us with a science background, we just have to keep blowing these ideas out of the water.  </p>

<p>Or we can start posting round earth threads around the clock.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you delved into the specifics of the topic or did you make a quick determination because the conclusion is so outlandish?</p>

<p>For it to be possible a couple of prerequisite understandings are required:</p>

<p>(1) Space fraud.  NASA and other official agencies must be lying.  If we look closely, we see this is the case.  Nothing we get from them can be accepted at face value.  Why are they producing fraudulent material?</p>

<p>(2) An understanding of the nature of the world power structure.  The belief in an East-West oppositional paradigm gives rise to arguments like &quot;the Russians would have said something&quot;.  The realization that the same groups of people have ruled the majority of the world for a very long time at a level that supercedes nations is needed.</p>

<p>Now we are in a position to give this idea fair consideration.  My own position on this topic is that the official spinning ball model is not correct for a number of reasons.  I cannot promote the standard flat earth model because it has some problems with it that I don&#39;t have a good explanation for.  However disproof of any particular model is not direct proof of another.  Problems with the standard flat earth model don&#39;t excuse problems with the spinning globe.  It only requires one solid refutation of a model for it to be incorrect.</p>

<p>This post made yesterday lists some specific problems with the generally accepted cosmology:<br/>

<p>The railroad argument is one of the dumbest things I&#39;ve ever heard. It&#39;s not 100 miles of one piece of track. It&#39;s pieces of track 12-18 feet long laid one at a time. Curvature is accounted for as you&#39;re laying piece by piece. </p>

<p>This is ambiguous...  Also subjective.  The globe model probably wouldn&#39;t make sense to an invalid.  Does that mean the Earth isn&#39;t a globe?</p>
