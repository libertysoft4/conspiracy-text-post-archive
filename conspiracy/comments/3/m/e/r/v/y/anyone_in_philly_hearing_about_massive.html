    <div class="md"><p>You realize that this is the public event for the Pope on his visit. This is Mass which he will not perform anyplace else in the country and the Pope&#39;s visits are not guaranteed when and where in the future.</p>

<p>Many are saying the President does not get this, that is because the President makes visits around the country on a regular Basis and is not conducting one of the most Sacred rituals of the Catholic Religion, Mass.</p>

<p>There will be people from all over the country in Philly tomorrow as it is almost a once in the lifetime event for Catholics, so yes this event does need this kind of security.</p>

<p>As a light hearted side, this is Philly guys, where fans attack their own teams, violent flash mobs are common, and crime is a big employer in the city, but Bill Burr did sit em in their place.</p>

And the military (national guardsmen) are not armed and are providing traffic and pedestrian control.  So there&#39;s no PC issue here.</p>

<p>I understand that there are going to be A LOT of people there tomorrow and people are nuts and they need to secure the area, but I&#39;m seeing people report that there are Guardsmen and women on every corner throughout the city...not sure if that&#39;s hyperbole or truth...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I swear I&#39;ve seen this before, actually, but I&#39;m spacing on which port area. I only remember because I hadn&#39;t seen them with the mounted guns before then and I&#39;m always kind of creeped out by that. </p>

<p>I remember going to Mexico years ago and seeing police with giant guns and being happy I lived in America, where we didn&#39;t need submachine guns on every corner...how times have changed. I was driving down the highway a few weeks ago and there were police all over waving long guns around!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ugh. Weapons like that are almost guaranteed to cause collateral damage. Pardon the pun but IMO it&#39;s overkill. A user commented on a different thread that this looks like a convenient event to practice cooperation between agencies during an emergency lock-down. I feel trapped just looking at the photos. 
When you mentioned long guns, I thought about last week when a state trooper attending a training event in a town nearby me, shot himself in the leg as he moved his shotgun out of his vehicle. This was no rookie either! 
I&#39;m sorry, but after witnessing thousands of bullets zinging this way and that in Watertown a few years ago, I can&#39;t trust any &quot;public safety&quot; officers. It&#39;s way too much Boys and their toys for me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do realize that this is a huge event with massive logistics involved. Whenever a religious event of this magnitude occurs the govt will pull out all the stops to ensure we are not responsible for getting the pope killed.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see where this ties in with a conspiracy. Calm your nerves</p>
