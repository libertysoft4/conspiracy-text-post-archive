<p>Because the Rothschilds were Satanists they adopted this powerful magic symbol in 1822 for their coat- of-arms. The name they adopted for their family actually comes from the fact that in the 17th century Mayer Amschel Bauer began hanging out a red hexagram in front of their house to identify it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1836 Zevi Hirsch Kalischer approached Rothschild and proposed Rothschild buy all of Erez Israel. It took many years for the Rothschilds to finally create Israel. The Rothschilds have been a primary force behind the creation of Israel, and so it is appropriate that the nation carries their magical Seal of Solomon as the state logo. The Ultra-orthodox Jews in Israel will not serve in the Israeli army because they know that Almighty God was not behind the creation of modern Israel, but rather the rich ungodly apostate Jews. They refuse to serve the ungodly.</p>

If what I have been exposed to regarding pedophaelia, ritual sacrifice, occultism, demonology, and witchcraft is fully accurate then I have no doubt that all of these higher ups are the on the same team. They make us think that there is a conflict between them when there really isn&#39;t. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The symbols used by elites are related to mystery Babylon religion and Kabbalah, both of which have their origins in Egypt. The Kabbalah itself is not &quot;satanic,&quot; but the Kabbalah does concern itself with metaphysics, which is considered apostasy in accordance with Christian or traditional, Torah Jewish faiths.</p>

<p>One of the primary goals of the Knights Templars was to find and learn of the Kabbalah and other sacred &quot;Jewish&quot; texts. They found some within the Temple of Solomon and it has been discovered that the Templars conducted extensive excavations below Solomon&#39;s Temple in attempts to discover more texts. You can find some pictures of Templar graffiti in the shape of the Kabbalah online. So partly why the Templars began to deviate away from Christianity was their discovery of Kabbalah and related texts and artifacts.</p>

<p>Through their Crusades, the Templars adopted the practices of the Ismaili Hashashins (i.e. assassins) and would later incorporate these systems learned of from the Hashashins into later historical secret societies. </p>

<p>When the Templars were suppressed by the Papacy, they fled to various parts of Europe, most notably Scotland and Spain. In Scotland, the Templars made a secret society that was intended to continue some aspects of Templarism and they called it Scottish Rite Freemasonry. This was the original form of Freemasonry, and was not nefarious in nature. </p>

<p>By the time of the Protestant Reformation, the Papacy sought to use the Spanish Templars to covertly revive the Order and reinitialize their historic allegiance to the Pope in order to wage war against Protestants, heretics and liberals. The early Templar military Orders in Spain existing during the 12th century such as the Order of Montesa and the Order of Calatrava would eventually form a secret society known as &quot;Los Alumbrados&quot; (meaning &quot;the enlightened ones&quot;). A Basque nobility Templar member of the Los Alumbrados named Ignatius Loyola would be used by Venetian-Papal Nobility including the Spanish Grandee Francis Borgia and the Pope at the time, Alessandro Farnese to fully revive the Knights Templars under a different name. With the commissioning from Farnese (Pope Paul III) and the financing coming from Borgia, The Society of Jesus was created with Loyola to head up the Order. The Society of Jesus is also known as the Jesuit Order.</p>

<p>Starting in 1754 in the Jesuit College of Clermont in Paris, the Jesuit revived Templars would re-author the Rites of what is now known as Scottish Rite Freemasonry, which they dubbed the &quot;Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry.&quot; This effectively hijacked the original Scottish Masonry started by exiled Templars who were at the time not in association with the Pope. The Jesuits wrote the first 25 Rites of contemporary Scottish Rite Masonry in 1754 and later in the 1780s during their suppression by Pope Clement XIV, they would complete the last eight Rites in Prussia under Frederick II who gave them refuge.</p>

<p>The 17th century also saw the rise to prominence of a  proclaimed Jewish messiah, Sabbatai Zevi. The followers of this Jewish apostate movement became known as Sabbateans and were Kabbalists. In the 18th century, Jacob Frank would claim to be the reincarnation of Zevi  and gained his own Hebrew followers (known today as Sabbatean Frankists). At this time, in 1776, the Bavarian Illuminati was formed by the Jesuits which made accord between the Masonic, Sabbatean House of Rothschild and the Jesuit Papacy. Truth be told, the Sabbatean Frankists were in league with the Jesuit Order’s Bavarian Illuminati. With the King of Poland serving as his sponsor, Frank was baptized into the Roman Catholic institution as were all of his Hebrew followers. </p>

<p>Shortly after this time, the Order imported the French Revolution from Bavaria into France, later giving way to the rise of Napoleon and his Consulate. On this three-man triumvirate were First Consul Napoleon himself, Second Consul Jesuit Abby Sieyes and Third Consul Roger Ducos. Napoleon was guided by Sieyes in all his campaigns, especially during his campaign in North Africa and in Palestine. For Napoleon, the Great Jesuit Avenger, on the advice of his Jesuit master sought to make Palestine “a homeland for the Jews.” This is where the political movement of Labor Zionism originates from. Note that today, Sabbatean-Frankist, Masonic Labor Zionists are the ones who control the Israeli government for the Jesuit Papacy. They are the modern equivalent of Papal Court Jews. Napoleon was really the first Masonic Labor Zionist leading the movement for Jews to repopulate their promised land for the benefit of the Jesuit Papacy yet to be restored in 1814. </p>

<p>During the 19th century, after the Order had completely gained control of both the British Crown and Parliament, the Jesuits&#39; socialist-communist British Fabian Socialists gave birth to the socialist-communist British Labor Party and hence to the socialist-communist Jewish Labor Party of the historic Masonic Jewish Labor Zionists. The leader of the Masonic Jewish Labor Zionists was Theodor Herzl, the Jew who led the fight to found a new Jewish State in historic Palestine after the Jesuit-concocted Dreyfus Affair, it to be a rebirth of the historic nation of Israel. The real purpose for the establishment of a Jewish homeland was to revive the Knights Templars’ Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem (AD 1099-1291)—for the benefit of the Pope, the Pope overseen and captive to the Jesuit Superior General, the Grand Master of this new Knights Templar. These Masonic Jewish Labor Zionists rule Israel for the benefit of Rome, not for the benefit of the racial Hebrew/Jewish/Israelite people in Israel. The Labor Zionists are completely in the arms of the Jesuit Papacy and are in fact Jesuit Temporal Coadjutors. Nazi Germany was a creation of the Jesuits which is in itself quite a lengthy topic and beyond the scope of this discussion, but Labor Zionism was the only type of Zionism allowed under Roman Catholic Adolf Hitler whose Third Reich would work with the Labor Zionists to establish the State of Israel (again, for the Benefit of Rome). </p>

<p>Continuing along, there is the founding of the CIA by two Roman Catholic Papal Knights of Malta, one being the former Nazi SS chief intelligence officer for Hitler, Reinhard Gehlen. Gehlen was responsible for also training and setting up the Israeli Mossad intelligence agency, this according to John Loftus.</p>

<p>Today, we see that top government positions are occupied by Jesuit-trained/Jesuit-alumni, Roman Catholics and Papal Knights. The DHS which arose from 9/11 is one prime example, having been created and subsequently controlled by Jesuit-trained Roman Catholics Knights of Columbus and SMOM members such as John Gannon, Emilio Gonzales, Randy Beardsworth, Tom Ridge and Janet Napolitano.</p>

<p>So it is the revived Knights Templars - the Jesuits, who are truly in control of this world via their Masonic networks and loyal Papal Knights (that includes the Rothschilds who are members of various Papal Knighthoods and hold the title &quot;Guardians of the Papal Treasure&quot; as per the 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia).</p>

<p>Give it a good think; The Jews aren&#39;t supposed to go to Israel until the messiah comes back. This whole business about a Jewish state is against the Tenakh. Ask and Haredi or Hasidic Jew and they&#39;ll confirm this.</p>

<p>Zionism goes against the teachings of Judaism.</p>
