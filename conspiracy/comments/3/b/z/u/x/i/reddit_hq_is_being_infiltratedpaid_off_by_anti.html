<p>Ellen Pao, Reddit&#39;s CEO, is a member of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspen_Institute">Aspen Institute</a>.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Aspen Institute is largely funded by foundations such as the Carnegie Corporation, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, the Gates Foundation, the Lumina Foundation, and the Ford Foundation  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Their revenue for 2013 was $97,847,062.  </p>

<p>Bernie Sanders seems to be committed in getting political influence out of the hands of the rich few and back into those of the larger American public. There&#39;s no direct correlation here, but whenever such powerful individuals join together, you can bet it&#39;s not for some tea and crackers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess you can look at it from two ways:  </p>

<p>A) Reddit&#39;s board may have been unaware how much mess Pao would bring and all of these other recent events are coincidence.  </p>

<p>B) Reddit&#39;s board knew exactly what they were doing. They hired her as a defender of their nest egg, something more likely for those looking to make a profit. FatPeopleHate was first to go because some don&#39;t want to advertise where they can be associated with abusive behavior. The rest of the story can be contributed to the same goal: making Reddit profitable while doing away with those who stand in the way.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m glad to see how many mods are resisting these efforts, but worried the admins will gain control of virtually everything and do their best to restore Reddit to happy days. I surmise most readers on Reddit do not care about whether or not free speech is maintained effectively, and this could all be forgotten just like every other media craze.</p>

<p>Has reddit influenced my mind?  Is this their goal? </p>

<p>I read so much on here about how he&#39;s the man that&#39;s actually going to represent the people and wants to fix problems in government and get money out of it.</p>

<p>I need to look further into it, I&#39;m never going to fall for another Obama again, I voted for that turd in 2008 and was completely naive then.  I may still be, but not nearly as much.</p>

<p>American propaganda is a powerful tool and I&#39;d be foolish to think I&#39;m immune to it despite my efforts to be.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve past the event horizon. Do you <em>honestly</em> believe electing a specific person will make a difference?</p>

<p>No, the cabal is too big. If the person is honest &amp; really tries to bring good change beneficial to the plebs (which no politician is like), they&#39;d be killed or otherwise subverted.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve got ourselves the Roman Empire 2.0. This time, the fall will be faster and in more epic proportions than ever before, though.</p>

<p>Ellen Pao, Reddit&#39;s CEO, is a member of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspen_Institute">Aspen Institute</a>.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Aspen Institute is largely funded by foundations such as the Carnegie Corporation, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, the Gates Foundation, the Lumina Foundation, and the Ford Foundation  </p>

<p>Their revenue for 2013 was $97,847,062.  </p>

<p>Bernie Sanders seems to be committed in getting political influence out of the hands of the rich few and back into those of the larger American public. There&#39;s no direct correlation here, but whenever such powerful individuals join together, you can bet it&#39;s not for some tea and crackers.</p>
