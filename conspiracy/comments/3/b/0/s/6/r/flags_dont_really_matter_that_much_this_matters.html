        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Flags don&#39;t really matter that much. This matters. The biggest corporations are giving themselves much more power, via congress, in a secret deal no one is allowed to read, that has just passed the senate. <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-06-23/obama-faces-union-anger-ahead-corporate-coup-detat-trade-deal-fast-track-vote">http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-06-23/obama-faces-union-anger-ahead-corporate-coup-detat-trade-deal-fast-track-vote</a></p>

<p>Why should you care? It would &quot;allow foreign companies to challenge U.S. laws — and potentially to pick up huge payouts from taxpayers — without ever stepping foot in a U.S. court.&quot;</p>

<p>It also &quot;could lead to gigantic fines, but it wouldn’t employ independent judges. Instead, highly paid corporate lawyers would go back and forth between representing corporations one day and sitting in judgment the next.&quot;
<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/kill-the-dispute-settlement-language-in-the-trans-pacific-partnership/2015/02/25/ec7705a2-bd1e-11e4-b274-e5209a3bc9a9_story.html">http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/kill-the-dispute-settlement-language-in-the-trans-pacific-partnership/2015/02/25/ec7705a2-bd1e-11e4-b274-e5209a3bc9a9_story.html</a></p>

<p>So, if I&#39;m understanding this correctly, if Obama doesn&#39;t veto this (which he won&#39;t because his business partners won&#39;t let him) then we will begin to see the formation of an international supra-governmental corporate-owned court system, beholden to no particular nationality or government, perhaps even superseding them in power. Sounds like the beginning of a dystopian novel. </p>

<p>So maybe mention this to some people and spread the word, since our lovely corporate-owned media is largely neglecting to talk about it in leiu of this manufactured controversy about a 150 year old flag.</p>

<p>If I&#39;m not mistaken, isn&#39;t that exactly what the New World Order is?    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It passed the senate and it had already passed the house (no surprise with a republican majority), and most likely will not be vetoed by Obama because he is also owned by corporations.</p>

<p>As I see it, this TPP provides a sort of skeleton framework for an international corporatocracy that is more powerful than any government. I think if this thing goes without too much controversy, it&#39;ll be like the patriot act and gradually we&#39;ll lose more and more freedoms. Say goodbye to any remaining shreds of the middle class.</p>

<p>The thing about power, is there needs to be a check on the power. The government was supposed to be that check against corporate power, but instead it is clear the corporations have won. So what now? The only power left is people power. If hundreds of millions of Americans unrelentingly wanted something and were vocal about it, it would happen. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have done some more reading and realized that only the TPA has passed the senate, which is a &quot;fast track&quot; bill for the TPP, which apparently will essentially guarantee the TPP can slide through easily and pass. It lays the groundwork to ensure the vote on the TPP itself passes smoothly. </p>

<p>So this is your silver lining. The TPP itself will come up for vote in less than 1 month. You have a few weeks to make a difference by informing others, if you so choose.</p>

<p>So there is still time, but the passage of the TPA is basically like the TPP passing unless there happens to be humongous pressure on congress and obama by the people of the USA to not pass this TPP. </p>

<p>This is an extremely serious situation we Americans find ourselves in right now, and 99% of us don&#39;t even realize it. It&#39;s like when the 1913 Federal Reserve Act was passed with a minimum of congressmen present, on Christmas Eve, while everyone was distracted. Those criminals know they only have to squeak the bill through once. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The thing about power, is there needs to be a check on the power</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That check is either gone, or severely eroded. To me, this looks like the beginning of a one-world government. The real deal. One where national borders don&#39;t mean anything and the power is based on money instead of military might.</p>

<p>You can vote whichever way you like, but it would make even less of a difference because the money people will be telling the government what to do, instead of the other way around. It&#39;s kind of been like this for a long time anyways (eg. lobbying, special interest groups). But until now, the power of money was officially supposed to take second place to the power of democratically elected officials and legislators.</p>

<p>Now it will be (to a large degree) <em>the other way around</em>. Un-elected people, like shareholders and corporate boards of directors, will have more power than the elected leaders of nations. I doubt that even 1% of the general public is aware of this or what a massive change this is.</p>

<p>Somehow I doubt this will turn out to be a good thing. Why? Because human nature. The kind of person you have to be to rise to the top in the corporate world might not be the kind of person you want to have in charge of how the world is run. Also remember, these are the same people that own practically all the media. They&#39;ll tell us what they think we should hear and believe. Then they&#39;ll go off and make a paradise for themselves at our expense.</p>

<p>TPP = Total Power Plan.</p>

<p>Sadly the way we have been told and taught to be vocal ensures that this will never happen. Everyone has been told that their issue matters and activist groups and protesters are constantly shouting over top of each other trying to be the loudest so their issue gets addressed. If all these people worked together they could put enough pressure on the government to address ALL the issues. Sadly we have been raised to try and be better than others instead of working together. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course it won&#39;t, but the problem is, nothing I do will. I don&#39;t have the means or the will to make a change, nor do I have an intellect to have a full understanding of how bad this world&#39;s going to go to shit, hence why I come into this subreddit and try to stay informed. It doesn&#39;t help me much, but it&#39;s all I can do. 
What do you think? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In all honesty you really just changed the way I think about you tinfoil hat guy on this subreddit, the best thing I had ever done was enlist in the military I love the military in the 9th generation in my family to enlist but I still don&#39;t think the goverment is a bunch  of lizards and shit. They are curry pt but they also give me my paycheck so that&#39;s a double edge sword..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not the whole government that are bad. You&#39;re right, they&#39;re not lizard people and they&#39;re not all ammoral phsycopaths, hell, I&#39;d bet I&#39;d most of them aren&#39;t even that bad. 
It&#39;s the minority, they&#39;re bad, THEY&#39;RE the ones who should be under scrutiny. Most of the government aren&#39;t bad, they&#39;re just mistaken, but that&#39;s forgivable because most people wouldn&#39;t do a batter job either . It&#39;s like with the police in America, they&#39;re not racist murderers, but some people are led to believe this because of their portrayal in media. 
But that aside, I&#39;m kinda interested in what being in the military was like. What was it you love about it? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. Yes I do. </p>

<p>Powerful people try to control information for a reason. Knowledge is power. The spread of information to get millions of people to tune in to this particular story is perhaps the most important weapon in our arsenal. </p>

<p>They don&#39;t want people knowing about this. They don&#39;t want people to react to this. </p>

<p>Somewhere around 3000 people saw this post (views are usually about 10-15x the number of votes). That&#39;s a lot of people. If some of those people tell people, who then tell other people... that means just from my one post I potentionally influenced the thoughts of over 10,000 people via the ripple effect of writing this post. It was a good way to spend an hour. Maybe I inspire one person to write their own post, and the whole process begins again. Millions of people can learn things from each other, this is how culture can change outside the influence of corporate media. This is extremely important, and I implore you not to undervalue this. </p>
