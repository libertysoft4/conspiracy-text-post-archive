<p>Ok, Windows cost money, Linux doesn&#39;t. Not a huge issue with shared hosting. But whatever, a one time, upfront fee.</p>

<p>But why do you keep saying php/scala/etc are free as if C#/.NET isn&#39;t? Also, ASPNext (v5), which will be released the end of next month, fully supports running on Linux. There are already plugins that turn Sublime into an ASPNext IDE. But hey, you still have Mono, which has been out for years. So there you have it, NO DIFFERENCE. NO FEES.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to pay for Visual Studio Pro. You could even use Visual Studio Express. Or, use Sublime to develop .NET 5 applications. All without spending a single dime.

<p>I guess I will say it again, as clear as I can. Open your OSX machine, download either MonoDevelop/Sublime/ASP vNext, install either Mono or that latest Microsoft linux bits, and BOOM! No Windows. Full .NET/ASP.NET debugging, IDE experience. Not a single dime spent. You can deploy this code also onto OSX/Linux for production use.</p>

<p>What you would said would make sense, but for the fact it was merely a joke, and I was by absolutely no means making it a point that the person you are forking over money to is white, and not black. </p>

<p>However, you got legitimately side tracked with an actual point you were trying to make. Voat being a VPS? What?!?!</p>

<p>I love this, you just keep digging. Please don&#39;t delete your comments.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you have windows, I don&#39;t. Windows cost, what ~200 for a copy?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No where in the entire application development life-cycle are you required to purchase a copy of Windows. I have made this point before and wouldn&#39;t normally reiterate it, but for you, I&#39;ll make an exception.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Using windows/ASP? We dev&#39;s laugh at you...</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>crickets</em></p>

<p>Judging by your downvotes, and my upvotes, I&#39;d say people are laughing <em>at you</em>. But, your too thick-headed to realize it, so I won&#39;t push it any further.</p>

<p>It fucking does! Are you sucking Bill Gate&#39;s dick? It cost more to run a MS server than a linux server. Linux is free, MS has royalties. Why I&#39;m even discussing this, is beyond me.

<p>Sure, for static resources, but this was the initial GET HTTP request.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>or the need more back-end nodes for the VIPs</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure. That could help. But they really need more than that, because they are eventually going to run into the next bottleneck, which is the database. They need caching of some kind, maybe second level caching. The also need to query something other than the SQL Server for high-performant reads that have pre-computed values for filtering/sorting. They need to query something that is meant for reads (Solr/ElasticSearch), and keep that in-sync with the persistent store. Designing a distributed system that manages this efficiently needs to be thought about before hand. The entire application is written as if it were a hobby application, which it was/is.</p>
