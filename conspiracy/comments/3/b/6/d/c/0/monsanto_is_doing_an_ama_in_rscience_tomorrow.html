<p>I&#39;d also expect him to talk about how great golden rice is and not take any questions regarding the social/biodiversity impact of BT cotton.</p>

<p>I, for one, hope that he makes the argument that people who are &quot;scared of GMO&quot; are similar to &quot;anti-vaxxers&quot; and &quot;climate deniers&quot;.</p>

<p>Edit:  WOW- I just noticed that they put the AMA up 5 hours before he&#39;s scheduled to answer the questions.  This really allows them to push the &quot;important&quot; questions to the top.  I notice that the gangs all there.  I have 3 existing &quot;GMO Shill&quot; tags on the top ten comments.</p>

Haha I respect your hesitant take on Monsanto given their Rep but the more I look into Monsanto the more I have respect for their organization. I hope you check it out; IMHO the real conspiracy is the hate this company receives, theoretically this technology they use could save billions of people in the coming generations.-probably lots of billionaires that would like to see that not happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I bet he doesn&#39;t, but henchmen/henchwomen will. If you notice in debates against big moneyed corporations, you&#39;ll find a bunch of useful non-regulars popping in with quick homilies and false &quot;talking points&quot; in the hope of pushing the public hive mind one way or the other, it doesn&#39;t matter if they need to lie to do it. When you confront them, they try to redefine/reframe their initial false talking points and will eventually disappear into a puff of smoke.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen this from big Agers (examples: gene splicing vs. breeding conflation, &quot;organic pesticides are more dangerous than glyphosate!,&quot; &quot;there are no studies showing glyphosate danger to people/environment!&quot;), bigPharmers (&quot;we haven&#39;t used mercury in vaccines since the 90s!&quot;), and bigAspartamers (&quot;there are zero studies about aspartame causing harm!&quot;) and I&#39;ve too often seen people take what they say as gospel and argue with them as if what they were saying is the truth when those spouting the lies are fully aware that they&#39;re lying. </p>

<p>Newsflash, y&#39;all: anonymous Internet astroturfers lie if they can get away with it. If you have the time, take that time to research their claims and confront them when they&#39;re lying, if only to help others who might get snowed.</p>

<p>Besides, so far all the example questions that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> would have preferred are basically just super-simplistic or blatantly calling Monsanto malevolent, which they wouldn&#39;t answer even if true. (and AMAs in general don&#39;t tend to approve of those.) </p>

<p>Which makes you wonder - they&#39;re going to start ignoring each others&#39; distress signals, what&#39;s it going to do to the aphids who are an important part of the ecosystem?

Yesterday the sub begged everyone to be polite, literally begged, and then said &quot; Monsanto does not attempt to control public discussion as far as we know&quot; yet there these folks are, their comment histories are all nothing but defending Monsanto, and all of their questions are the top / upvoted questions in the AMA, as if they were just regular members of <a href="/r/science">/r/science</a>, everyday folks asking everyday questions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Woah, here&#39;s another great question:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3b6mr4/science_ama_series_im_fred_perlak_a_long_time/csjbz21">In May 2013 Monsanto opened a seed bank in Ukraine at the expense on $140M. GM crops were illegal in Ukraine at the time so this seemed to make no sense at all. Then after the Ukrainian coup, the former investment banker and US State Department economist Natalie Jaresko was made Ukraine&#39;s Minister of Finance. Shortly after this she changed the Ukrainian law, under the instruction of the IMF, to allow GM crops to the be grown in Ukraine.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Inherently, there are very few things, if any, wrong with GMOs.  There might be problems with specific cases, e.g. monarch butterflies; externalities, e.g. the use of more glyphosate; or with the actions of companies that develop them, e.g. Monsanto.  In the end, they are just a tool to put genes into other organisms.</p>

<p>With GMOs, you could theoretically induce the organism, like a plant, to make more of a specific vitamin.  Or, you could also make the plant (or any other organism) to express something like an anthrax toxin.  For the last point, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if military biologists were trying to do that right now.</p>

<p>The science and innovation being done by Monsanto and bioengineering is extremely impressive to say the least. That being said, does Monsanto have any guidelines that separate the &quot;could we?&quot; and &quot;should we?&quot; Like they say on the original Jurassic Park.</p>
