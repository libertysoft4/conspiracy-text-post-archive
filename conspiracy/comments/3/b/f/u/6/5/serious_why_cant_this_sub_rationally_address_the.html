        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As a true skeptic, I have to say that my initial reactions to FE were similar to this subs. That being said, there are some serious issues raised that I cannot dismiss out of hand. I have been forced by reason to re-evaluate my original position. I would ask that you restrain your initial visceral response, hear the arguments and respond to them clearly and concisely. </p>

<p>Disregard allusions to religion and the consequences of such a thing and just examine the facts. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0FuO8lQV18&amp;index=8&amp;list=PLltxIX4B8_URNUzDE2sXctnUAEXgEDDGn">This is one of the arguments I consider the most compelling</a></p>

<p>How can you explain an utter lack of non-stop flights from AUS to anywhere in South America. Why are they not tracked on flight radar? For that matter why don&#39;t flights pass over Antarctica, surely it&#39;s a shorter distance between two points? After all they pass over the north pole and arctic circle all the time. Why is the southern hemisphere so different in terms of flight paths?</p>

<p>Another compelling argument is this: <a href="http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wkar/files/styles/medium/public/201505/lake_michigan_mirage.jpg">Why can Chicago be observed from Grand Mere state park in Michigan 60 miles across the lake?</a></p>

<p>If you&#39;re going to tell me that this is simply a 3,000 ft mirage. I would tell you to have your head examined. A mirage is a trick of light on a <em>heated</em> surface. Google any picture of a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=mirages&amp;es_sm=93&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UGGQVabzN8T3oATY6qLAAg&amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=699">mirage</a>. The image is <em>reflected</em> (and note that a reflection is an inversion of the original image) back onto the surface, not into the atmosphere. </p>

<p>It can&#39;t cause unique 1,400 ft structures to be refracted back perfectly into your view. </p>

<p>So if we can agree that this is a real and genuine image of Chicago from 60 miles away. How is it possible?</p>

<p>By simple geometry demonstrated <a href="http://www.davidsenesac.com/Information/line_of_sight.html">here</a></p>

<p>At 60 miles away, the Chicago skyline is some 2,380 feet below the visible horizon from this point. </p>

<p>The sears tower stands at 1,451 feet. That means that for the Chicago skyline to be seen as it is. The earth is miraculously refracting almost 4,000 feet of light into perfect view? </p>

<p>Have you really ever seen a mirage stand perfectly still for a picture?</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t think so. </p>

<p>So I&#39;ll ask the question again. Without resorting to ad hominem attacks and unscientific explanations of completely unrepeatable and untestable &quot;atmospheric conditions.&quot; </p>

<p>How does this sub address the very compelling arguments put forth for a flat earth?</p>

<p><strong>Edit: As predicted, this sub reacts exactly as outlined in the title. Bravo!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Edit 2: For a thread with less than 30% upvotes, that is ultimately buried into oblivion, there sure does seem to be an awful lot of activity. What&#39;s really going on here?</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>This theory might have some legs if the sum total of the proof offered didn&#39;t amount to &quot;Nu-uh. Doesn&#39;t happen.&quot;</p>

<p>What about people who fly regularly between Chile and Sydney? &quot;There are no flights - it&#39;s a ruse&quot;.</p>

<p>What about all the satellites? &quot;There aren&#39;t any - it&#39;s a ruse.&quot;</p>

<p>What about the residents of Tiera del Fuego who experience the midnight sun every year at the Austral solstice? &quot;Doesn&#39;t happen - they&#39;re lying.&quot;</p>

<p>What about cruise and tour operators who offer excursions to the South Pole specifically to experience this midnight sun phenomenon? &quot;Try to book one.&quot;</p>

<p>What about the fact that long-range snipers and ballistics infantrymen have to adjust their shots to account for the Coriolis and Eötvös effects? &quot;They&#39;re lying. All of them.&quot;</p>

<p>What about the ISS? Shuttle flights? Soyuz flights? &quot;Never happened - it&#39;s a ruse.&quot;</p>

<p>It seems that the whole of your argument is nothing more than a series of blanket denials. It&#39;s no wonder no-one takes you seriously.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love how they always use flightaware or flightradar and the like but have NO UNDERSTANDING of how they work. ADS-B is not going to be relayed from the middle of the ocean because there is no receivers within range to broadcast that information to the websites. That&#39;s why &quot;flights zomg disappear.&quot; I also love how they use flight booking sites as further proof. No one has any understanding of direct flights and the economics behind them either. It&#39;s all about profit to the airlines. You can&#39;t get a direct flight because sending you to an area where more people want to go is more profitable. They want a loaded plane, not an empty 747 for the 8 people who might want to go to Auckland from Santiago. They also have no idea about how those planes require the help of the jet streams to achieve these cruising speeds and that these craft don&#39;t do those speeds right from take-off. </p>

<p>It&#39;s amazing how much they waste their brain power computing all these flat earth possibilities while ignoring the facts right in their face.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What gets me is how easy it would be to verify that there is indeed a conspiracy. Why don&#39;t they simply take a trip to Tiera del Fuego in late December? Spherical earth theory says that below 66 degrees, the sun will not set at all during that time. Seems like that would be fairly easy to verify.</p>

<p>Or, simply book <a href="http://www.cruisecompete.com/itins/queen_mary_2_cruises_bfege.html">this 22 day cruise</a> between Santiago and Sydney. Spherical earth says that the distance should be about 11,000 Km. A flat earth projection says that a direct route would be 30,000 Km (over the North Pole), while a &#39;great circle&#39; route would be closer to 50,000 Km. Bring your own homemade compass and anemometer, and carefully plot the route and average wind speed. The fact that the ship is not travelling 400 Km/h should be a clue that the distance is not nearly that great.</p>

<p>The whole sudden &quot;movement&quot; is kind of interesting in that they&#39;re using the classicly transparent &quot;debate&quot; tactics you typically see employed by PR departments on message boards, but they&#39;re using them to push flat earth theory.

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly couldn&#39;t say one way or the other. My working hypothesis is perhaps it&#39;s here to muddy the water and take away from thoughtful discussion about actual issues and to make the sub as a whole look bad to casual viewers. I just tag those who support it and make sure to take anything they might be submitting with a grain of salt. The problem is a few of them go on to post some thought provoking articles on other topics that in my opinion are provable conspiracies.</p>

<p>If this is true, then a helicopter that hovers would see the earth moving under it... which doesn&#39;t happen. You can&#39;t have your cake and eat it, too.</p>

<p>It&#39;s unfortunate that, yes, we are dealing with a ton of deception going on here. There&#39;s no other way around it. You guys can&#39;t refute the simplest experiment, the horizon at altitude, so you nitpick all sorts of other insignificant garbage built on the assumption that you&#39;re correct before you even start.</p>

<p><strong>If you can&#39;t prove the horizon, you have nothing.</strong> We have a flat, eye-level horizon at 20mi+ altitude which is <strong>completely impossible on a ball</strong>. The only way there would be a curve is if you were on a cylinder and the only way you would have an eye level horizon is if <strong>it&#39;s a plane</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Rising off of a ball does not, under any circumstances, bring the horizon up with the observer. It doesn&#39;t matter how big it is. Any altitude above a ball results in a horizon that is below eye level, period; no ifs, ands, or buts. The world is flat. Case closed.</strong> The ramifications of that truth are yours to clarify on your own, but there is no getting out of it without lying to yourself or choosing ignorance.</p>

<p>EDIT: Also... I&#39;ll just say it. Great choice of username. Scripture tells us that Satan masquerades as... yep... an AngelOfLight. Very clever.</p>

<p>Bullshit. <a href="http://www.victory-cruises.com/sail_antarctica.html">Here</a> is a tour that you can take that will allow you to experience the midnight sun in the Antarctic. Why don&#39;t you book it, and see for yourself?</p>

<p>You really have no clue how gravity works, do you? Also - try hard to think what the difference is between a bullet and a helicopter. (I&#39;ll give you a hint because you&#39;re obviously struggling - one of them has a powered engine, the other does not).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You guys can&#39;t refute the simplest experiment, the horizon at altitude, so you nitpick all sorts of other insignificant garbage built on the assumption that you&#39;re correct before you even start.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can refute it very easily. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/vhQuz1q.jpg">This</a> is a shot of the Aurora Australis taken from the ISS. Notice the rather prominent curvature? <a href="http://i.imgur.com/yfPsZzj.jpg">Here</a> is a picture of Atlantis docking with ISS. Notice the nice round ball in the background? That would be our planet. </p>

<p>The 20 mile thing that you keep harping on is a red herring. The earth&#39;s radius is close to 4,000 miles. Since humans are extremely small by comparison, it looks flat from the surface. Even if you change your elevation by 20 miles, that means that in relation to the earth&#39;s radius, you have only changed your perspective by 0.5%. You would have to get up a lot higher than that before you would start to notice the curvature. Like in <a href="http://petapixel.com/2013/05/28/25-space-camera-raspberry-pi-camera-snaps-photos-of-earth-on-a-balloon/">this</a> picture, which was taken from a weather balloon at about 40,000 meters. At this height you can start to make out the curvature of the earth. This is why pictures taken from the ISS and the shuttles at about 400 Km clearly show the earth&#39;s curvature. </p>

<p>When you get to about 45,000 Km, you will be able to see the <a href="http://i.imgur.com/BabDZ4Z.jpg">entire planet</a>. And at about 400,000 Km, you will be able to get both the <a href="http://i.imgur.com/0qgcCoI.jpg">earth and the moon</a> in one frame.</p>

<p>You have carefully made sure that your theory is unfalsifiable. You demand proof, and yet every picture I show you is denounced as a fake. The fact is that you simply don&#39;t want to believe the obvious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since there have already been some great responses to this comment which are still unchallenged by you, I&#39;ll reply only selecively, to add to what has already been said.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>What about all the satellites?  
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Show me some real pictures of them in orbit.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, since you dismissed the actual pictures that were already presented to you, what do you say <a href="http://www.satobs.org/seesat/seesatindex.html">to the community of thousands of amateur astronomers worldwide who regularly track, photograph, and compare notes on the orbital mechanics of hundreds of artificial satellites</a>? It&#39;s actually a rather popular pastime among amateur astronomers. Are they all &quot;in on it,&quot; too?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If this is true, then a helicopter that hovers would see the earth moving under it... which doesn&#39;t happen. You can&#39;t have your cake and eat it, too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, I&#39;m sorry, that&#39;s not how physics works. The atmosphere of the Earth is dragged along by the rotating planet beneath it, and its absolute velocity is usually a pretty close match to the surface rotational speed - this is why we don&#39;t, say, experience <strong><a href="http://www.universetoday.com/26623/how-fast-does-the-earth-rotate/">a constant 1,040 mile-per-hour wind at the equator</a></strong>. The atmosphere&#39;s minimal motion, relative to the surface, is why a helicopter can hover over one spot with ease - in essence, it is surfing on the atmosphere itself, which is moving (in an absolute sense) at quite a high speed, keeping up with the Earth below it. Or perhaps a better analogy than surfing might be: for the same reason that the ice in a drink sitting in a speeding car&#39;s cupholder doesn&#39;t all get pressed to one side (except during sudden accelerations, of course). The medium (soft drink or atmosphere) already has momentum, and the objects immersed in it (ice cubes or helicopters) are carried along with it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m interested to hear your rebuttals to these, and the other points, raised in this discussion.</p>

<p>I think the argument about the big bang is a good example, especially as cosmological theories are being postulated right now with alternative theories. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The round earth is the foundation of evolution, space, extra-terrestrials, etc... It induces the kind of mindset they want in people. Those who don&#39;t believe in God yet buy into their &#39;science&#39; will feel the crushing weight of their insignificance and give into sin... and that&#39;s what the devil is after.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter what you believe as long as you don&#39;t believe the scriptures. If they can&#39;t get you to reject them, they feed you false teachings instead to try and derail you.</p>

<p>Look... we&#39;re surrounded by Babylon (meaning confusion). We&#39;re in bondage to it. There are so many paths and so many truths we don&#39;t know what to believe. God brings us out of Babylon with the truth and sets us free. He saves us from confusion and saves our mind.</p>

<p>I challenge you to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtGurtmUa04">this one sermon</a>. You wouldn&#39;t believe how openly all of these connections are put forward in public knowledge and we don&#39;t see it because they&#39;re the ones who educate us. They think we&#39;re stupid and they teach us to be that way. It&#39;s systematic psychological warfare.</p>

<p>When the veil is lifted and people begin to see... the spirit of persecution will rise up. If they can&#39;t keep us blind, they&#39;ll just start killing us again.</p>

<p>There was of course a plane that crashed in the 70s because of brutal Antarctic weather, killing 200+ people.</p>

<p>Or a convection zone where warm air interacts with cold air, creating optical illusions. Its hypothesized that&#39;s why the lookouts on the Titanic didn&#39;t see the iceberg until it was on top of them - it was, in essence, cloaked in an optical illusion from the warm air/cold air/colder water.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is fun.</p>

<p>Regarding the flights, Occam&#39;s razor suggests a very simple explanation: there simply isn&#39;t very much demand for non-stop flights from Oceana to South America - at least not at the astronomical prices that would be required to cover the expense of fuel. By making layovers in popular, central destinations like Dubai, the airlines expand their clientele for these flights enormously, and allow the small number of people making the trip from Oceana to South America to be augmented by travelers making more popular, less expensive trips. Even as an anti-capitalist, the economics of this are evident to me. I would even presume that, should the economies of these two regions flourish further in the future, that demand for nonstop flights might overtake these pricing considerations and nonstop flights would become a regular feature. For now, the market just doesn&#39;t support it.</p>

<p>The same factors perfectly explain the lack of trans-polar flights over Antarctica (is that actually confirmed, by the way?).</p>

<p>This is all perfectly reasonable, and quite a bit more credible than your argument.</p>

<p>Re: the Chicago image, I direct you to this: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_refraction">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_refraction</a> . The effect can be quite potent. It&#39;s unfortunate that this example has been labeled a <em>mirage</em> by some, because you are indeed correct - it isn&#39;t one - but it is still very easily explained by atmospheric refraction.</p>

<p>Some further thoughts:</p>

<p>In the video, we&#39;re presented with various &quot;maps&quot; of this flat Earth several times, exemplified here: <a href="https://imgur.com/Yhh12mk">https://imgur.com/Yhh12mk</a> . So, let&#39;s plan <a href="http://www.traveller.com.au/coming-soon-australia-to-london-nonstop-1utjz">a nonstop flight from Sydney, Australia to London, England</a> - a route which only in the last couple of years, mind you, became economically feasible for airlines to offer.</p>

<p>According to the flat Earth map as presented, such a flight along its shortest route would take us almost precisely over what is commonly known as the North Pole, also crossing over some of Northern Russia, and frankly, not much else.</p>

<p>As plotted on a round Earth, however, <a href="https://imgur.com/D6alDAQ">the route is dramatically different</a> (the red line, in this example) - brushing by tropical Thailand, through China, over Kazakhstan and so on, nary a pole in sight.</p>

<p>One would think, quite reasonably, that the pilots, crew, and indeed even the passengers of these nonstop flights might be able to look down at the ground and distinguish, at a glance, whether they were crossing over Thailand or over the North Pole. Should the flight crew&#39;s instruments happen to tell them that they&#39;re over subtropical Southern China, while meanwhile the terrain outside their windows is marked by glaciers and permafrosted taiga, one would think that one of them, any of them, might happen to raise the issue to someone - or at least share it on Facebook. So the essential question is, why haven&#39;t they?</p>

<p>Naturally, you might say, the flights are deliberately diverted on a significantly bent course that keeps the plane more &quot;Southerly&quot; (as much as such a bearing exists on a flat Earth), in such a way that it better follows the expected path. But to do so would not only make the flight outrageously lengthy (likely well beyond the maximum range of any such nonstop flight), but would also require very plain and apparent course corrections for the flight crew to make, which, in their expected framework, would make no sense whatsoever. Do you mean to tell me that hundreds, maybe thousands of professional pilots and navigators have never once wondered seriously about why they would adjust their heading by a significant factor (perhaps 20 degrees or more) twice in such a flight, ostensibly increasing their flight time and fuel consumption enormously, for literally no explicable reason whatsoever?</p>

<p>I&#39;m very curious to hear your thoughts on these matters, as this is a great critical thinking exercise for me and rather enjoyable. I hope that these points find an welcome place in an open mind - yours.</p>

<p>Have a closer look. The route the plane would take on &quot;the globe&quot; is perfectly compatible with the azimuth equidistant map. I don&#39;t suppose they would fly the shortest distance between two points. They aren&#39;t interested in tipping their hands. </p>

<p>The one flight that simply doesn&#39;t work is anywhere in AUS to anywhere in Southern South America. I promise you, you can&#39;t find one of these flights that doesn&#39;t have multiple layovers, or disappears from flight radar with a non-existent air-speed log. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>There is a lot wrong with this. For one thing, our atmosphere does not extend all the way to the sun - it is in fact a remarkably thin layer, comparable to the thickness of a single coat of paint on an Easter Egg. The atmospheric refraction effects for both the Sun <strong>and</strong> the City of Chicago in your example are wrought by roughly the same amount of atmosphere. And it is plenty to exert quite an effect.</p>

<p>Further, the science is indeed testable, and has indeed been tested, over, and over, and over again. <a href="https://www.metabunk.org/earth-curvature-refraction-experiments-debunking-flat-concave-earth.t6042/">The effect follows simple and demonstrable mathematical laws that have not only been tested outright, but that provide predictions of future phenomena with accuracy.</a> That is, in fact, the gold standard of verified, in a scientific sense. This effect is so &quot;solved,&quot; and so well-observed, that it is a known and necessary component of many routine operations, like radio communications with aircraft, long-distance surveying, and certainly a thousand other fields that I can&#39;t even think of at the moment.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Right, and this is exactly what I expected you to say. But I also refuted it, and the point remains outstanding. The alternative that you propose would require significant course corrections for no reason that the flight crew would understand. Why wouldn&#39;t some pilot at some point say, &quot;hey, you know, we could probably save about 50% of our fuel cost if we just went in a straight line.&quot; You don&#39;t think they would say that? Why not?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Taking a heading does not rely on GPS. All it requires is a compass - a very simple instrument. The course corrections you propose would be very, very apparent to anyone with a compass at hand (and I assure you, this is an instrument that is <strong>front and center</strong> in any plane&#39;s cockpit). If they started out bearing 280 degrees, then ended their route bearing 340 degrees, you don&#39;t think that that <em>might</em> seem a <em>little</em> odd to the crew, whose entire <strong>job</strong> is to manage that heading as precisely as possible?</p>

<p>So, are the compasses &quot;in on it,&quot; too? Are they rigged? What about homemade compasses, which are remarkably easy to devise? Are those also rigged, somehow? If so, how?</p>

<p>Even <strong>without</strong> a compass, it&#39;s <strong>still</strong> possible to take reasonably accurate headings based on the Sun alone - certainly to with ten degrees or so. Do you mean to tell me that a difference of 60 degrees or more in the Sun&#39;s expected position would be something that thousands of professional pilots, with decades of experience in navigation, would simply not seem to notice or mind much?</p>

<p>Do you understand how unreasonable the arguments you&#39;re making are?</p>

<p>Those aren&#39;t the whole buildings dude. It&#39;s obvious that skyline is cut off along the bottom.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The relevant buildings are all on Wacker Drive on a section that runs more or less parallel to the shore of Lake Michigan. Specifically the Willis Tower and 311 Wacker Drive. Grande Mere State Park happens to lie along a line running perpendicular to that street. Also because the distances between those buildings very small compared to the distance from which they are being observed they should still scale proportionally to the human eye.</p>

<p>The Willis tower basically divides into three discrete sections that grow thinner from bottom to top. You can only see two sections in this picture. The bottom, and largest, section is completely occluded. How can you obviously see the divides in the other two sections while not seeing the bottom section at all?</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to grant you that you shouldn&#39;t see these at all. I will completely cede the point. Now explain this fucking phenomenon within your model in a satisfactory way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How is the picture of the Chicago Skyline an argument FOR a flat earth?</p>

<p>Or to elaborate: </p>

<ol>
<li>Using the numbers in the table you&#39;ve linked, the skyline should not be visible.</li>
<li>On a flat earth, shouldn&#39;t the bottom of the skyline be visible?</li>
<li>While point 1. could be tweaked by including the following statement from your source - point 2. stays unexplained:</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>In the real world there are however atmospheric effects of mainly ray refraction that tend to cause objects beyond the theoretical horizon to sometimes be visible</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So on our layman level of argumentation, the round earth arguments are stronger, imho.</p>

They are also not nearly as populated nor as weslthy, thus so few flights in the south and they do not go over the south pole. That said, flights go every day from Santiago, Chile to Auckland, NZ in 11-13 hours. This Is not possible on a flat earth map.</p>

<p><a href="http://goo.gl/flights/9AmL">http://goo.gl/flights/9AmL</a></p>

<p>The earth is not a globe, but it is not flat. Careful geodetic measurements done with the Rectilineator conclusively proved concave curviture. Hence spatial 2d geometry holds the same, but 3d geometry is invented. Strange but true!</p>

<p>Flat earth cannot model the stars/planets nor account for southern pole rotation. Concave can do both, plus they have fancy classical music to make it extra convincing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not at all.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a particular pattern in arguing, especially on Reddit, where instead of actually debating something on its merits, the arguer will put forth false evidence, and then will dodge and hedge and discount any evidence that is put forth. This will then devolve into complaints about those who engage in the debate or whining about downvotes. My assumption has always been that people who argue in this manner don&#39;t themselves really believe what they&#39;re arguing for/against, and that&#39;s why the odd, avoidant, and generally lackluster debating performance comes out.</p>

<p>I just find the whole thing really interesting, is all, and trying to test my own perceptions of the phenomenon and whether they&#39;re accurate sometimes, often, always, or not at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not at all.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a particular pattern in arguing, especially on Reddit, where instead of actually debating something on its merits, the arguer will put forth false evidence, and then will dodge and hedge and discount any evidence that is put forth. This will then devolve into complaints about those who engage in the debate or whining about downvotes. My assumption has always been that people who argue in this manner don&#39;t themselves really believe what they&#39;re arguing for/against, and that&#39;s why the odd, avoidant, and generally lackluster debating performance comes out.</p>

<p>I just find the whole thing really interesting, is all, and trying to test my own perceptions of the phenomenon and whether they&#39;re accurate sometimes, often, always, or not at all.</p>

<p>This evidence is damning that NASA faked the Apollo missions and continues to fake space exploration. I&#39;m not saying &quot;nuh uh.&quot; I&#39;m saying look at the evidence, you&#39;ve been sold a lie. </p>

<p>The question from there goes: &quot;Okay, so why did they lie?&quot;</p>

<p>My curiosity has led me to use scientific evidence on the topic, while your curiosity ends with you claiming all our evidence and photos are fake. But yours is real? </p>

<p>I wish it was as easy for me as it is for you to tell people to wake up or call evidence fake without any proof that it is.</p>
