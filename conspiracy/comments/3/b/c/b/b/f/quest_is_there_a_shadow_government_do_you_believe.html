    <div class="md"><p>There are no aliens at the top of the pyramid. There are people who have gone mad with ultimate power.</p>

<p>Who really counts is anyone who can create money. They ultimately decide what happens because they ultimately decide what gets funded and what does not. They decide who fights and who wins in wars by their ability to decide funding.</p>

<p>Who ultimately creates money?</p>

<p>The Bank for International Settlements, (BIS),  the central bank of the central banks.</p>

<p>Their board of directors include the chairmen of all of the central banks of the world which in turn also create money.</p>

<p>Banks that belong to the BIS have a very near world wide monopoly on banking. There are very few exceptions Some countries that have recently &#39;made a decision to&#39; join the near monopoly are Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya.</p>

<p>Get the picture?</p>

<p>The one that is expected to tumble next is Syria, then Iran, is it becoming clearer?</p>

<p>The final few will then fall into alignment or be destroyed.</p>

<p>Here are a hodgepodge of links about the BIS starting with the conspiracy which is what is most relevant here.</p>

<p>Here.are some of the worst aspects of the BIS the central bank of the central banks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The central bankers meet up once every 2 months and decide their next moves </p>

<p>Everyone else is dependent on them including the Military Industrial Complex that you referred to. </p>

<p>Any living person or group can be either helped or destroyed by them through their ability to decide where money goes and where it does not.</p>

<p>They are in charge &#39;cause, &#39;what&#39;s the use if you aint got no juice? </p>

<p>The military works for whoever pays them and gives them orders, that is ultimately, the Bank for International Settlements or a member central bank through more street level banks such as J.P. Morgan  If the BIS decides something is stopped, it&#39;s stopped.</p>

<p>If the government or any subdivision of it cannot pay for men and materials because of background manipulation by the banks, then their orders go nowhere.</p>

<p>Describe for me a possible way for them not to be in charge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just before their collective  rise to power these guys were known in D.C. as the crazies. They were elected because the religious right backed them.</p>

<p>Sociopaths and psychopaths never make good leaders .</p>

<p>All of their decisions are based simply on personal greed because they have greatly reduced ability to feel, or even fake, compassion, conscience , empathy or remorse.</p>

<p>But there doesn&#39;t have to be a biblical reason for it when a psychological one will explain it just as well.</p>

<p>People who cannot feel, also want to control others because they all greatly fear the rest of humanity, so they are the ones who seek out the power to control others . </p>

<p>That way the crazies get the power and we all get damaged by them.</p>

<p>We could combine our interests and beliefs by opposing such people getting positions of power in the first place. Unfortunately many of your persuasion believe fervently that people are powerless and that unseen forces are at play and actually backed their election</p>

<p>I see the sociopaths in leadership You named a raft of them.</p>

<p>I think others can see them too.</p>

<p>They just mislabel what is going on. They mislabel it because they see imaginary scenes being played out and ignore the human aspects.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the biggest problem.
 Your side is madly trying to bring the horror story of the Bible (Babble) into real life so they can force their God to &#39;return&#39; .</p>

<p>Consider this, If they can force him to come back or anything else at all,  he isn&#39;t much of a god.</p>

<p>Yet hundreds of millions who are  caught up in their fantasies are trying with all of their beings to force such a nightmare on the earth while also firmly believing they are the good guys.</p>

<p>If the BIS is anything, it isn&#39;t bored. It can force any event it feels like forcing. I just hope they aren&#39;t babble believers. Unfortunately they apparently are.</p>

<p>Their building and their philosophy come from the story of the Tower of Babel.</p>

<p>First off their building is designed to look like it.</p>

<p>They obviously believe they can prevent  their God from destroying them as their namesake was.</p>

<p>They come from all over the earth and speak almost as many languages are there are members.</p>

<p>The main thing associated with the tower of babel , other than its destruction was this quote.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then they said, &quot;Come, let us build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves; otherwise we will be scattered over the face of the whole earth.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, yeah, people who believe as you do intend to destroy your only world, just as an experiment to see if they can overpower their &#39;God&#39; and force him to do something.</p>

<p>I said, and I agree with you, Just as an experiment. </p>

<p>EDIT 2: To whoever&#39;s downvoting me, remmember downvoting is if the content is bad, not if you disagree. I&#39;m open-minded, and you can give me proof of NASA missions are fake and so on, i&#39;ll gladly watch it. Just don&#39;t give me the already debunked &quot;No stars, waving flag&quot; and so on.

<p>The Illuminati is actually Luciferians/Satanists. Illuminati is increasingly coming to the fore because they don&#39;t want you to know how deeply evil they are. </p>

<p>I was dubious of the aliens things, but I keep meeting more and more &quot;in-the-know&quot; types who swear they&#39;re for real, and travel via the Time/Space continuum, not conventional space travel. Now, I&#39;m really unsure. </p>

<p>If there is such a thing as time travel, though, the year a ton of things happened would be 1947. That&#39;s when they went back to, to set things right/in motion, IMHO. Not that I know it even happened. </p>

<p>But all that&#39;s some pretty heavy shit. I don&#39;t know that I need to dig that deep. There&#39;s enough weird shit that can be more easily verified and brought to light, if people would only pay attention.</p>

If Aliens are not real, then it&#39;s at least a very nice way to demonize those in power who seem to have nothing in common with the rest of humanity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just before their collective  rise to power these guys were known in D.C. as the crazies. They were elected because the religious right backed them.</p>

<p>Sociopaths and psychopaths never make good leaders .</p>

<p>All of their decisions are based simply on personal greed because they have greatly reduced ability to feel, or even fake, compassion, conscience , empathy or remorse.</p>

<p>But there doesn&#39;t have to be a biblical reason for it when a psychological one will explain it just as well.</p>

<p>People who cannot feel, also want to control others because they all greatly fear the rest of humanity, so they are the ones who seek out the power to control others . </p>

<p>That way the crazies get the power and we all get damaged by them.</p>

<p>We could combine our interests and beliefs by opposing such people getting positions of power in the first place. Unfortunately many of your persuasion believe fervently that people are powerless and that unseen forces are at play and actually backed their election</p>

<p>I see the sociopaths in leadership You named a raft of them.</p>

<p>I think others can see them too.</p>

<p>They just mislabel what is going on. They mislabel it because they see imaginary scenes being played out and ignore the human aspects.</p>
