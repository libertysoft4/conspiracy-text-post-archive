New cointel pro tactic? Maybe they are trying to decipher what exactly &quot;convinces&quot; a conspiracy minded individual to blindly believe in whatever theory. We all know that these types of forums are littered with disinfo to derail/confuse/distract people from real issues. Maybe they wan&#39;t to create the perfect concoction of pseudo-science bullshit and fabricated statistics to see who will blindly follow. They can then set up or use the same tactics to further lead the conspiracy community astray. Who else thinks this is a psy-op? </p>

<p>However, I have only vaguely skimmed through the flat earth stuff so Im not some authority on debunking it... but holy shitttttt it sounds retarded. I imagine that alot of people who come to r/conspiracy are automatically turned off when they see dumb shit about flat fucking earth. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Why have a conspiracy to make people believe the earth is round?</p></li>
<li><p>NASA does some questionable things, but to say every picture they release....of the Sun, distant planets, etc. is doctored and fake is ridiculous and unrealistic.</p></li>
<li><p>Mars rover fake? Why isn&#39;t mars flat? Are those pictures fake? What about the thousands of scientists who designed and are maintaining it? And the comet Philae lander? All just fake?</p></li>
<li><p>Pictures taken from space that make the earth look round are not fish eye lenses. This is the stupidest supporting argument they make. It looks round <em>because it is fucking round</em></p></li>
<li><p>Physics and mathematics (stuff you don&#39;t care about, because its probably fake or a conspiracy) absolutely refutes flat earth. Ask any professor or scientist if the earth is round. </p></li>
<li><p>Basic observation while on the ocean demonstrates the roundness of the earth. You can see things appear and disappear below the &quot;horizon&quot; as you move closer or farther.</p></li>
<li><p>Ancient scientists realized the earth was round, and they lived in the desert. They did a study in which a shadow cast by a stone pillar in one city was shorter than a shadow cast by another in a city over 200 miles away. (So imagine 2 upright sticks on a FLAT piece of paper and shining a light over it. Their shadows will look identical. Now BEND the paper and voila, one stick has a longer shadow because the angle from the light source has changed. This is unbelievably basic observation folks.)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If you aren&#39;t a disinfo agent and legitimately mindfucked by flat earth theory, just stop. People get aggressive and angry with you not because you have a point. You are literally just wrong, ridiculously wrong. Like saying 3+3 actually equals 9, not 6. </p>

<p>There are definitely theories worth believing, and I&#39;m not saying this one isn&#39;t worth researching. It&#39;s just after you do you realize every flat earther is just an ignorant moron.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m curious what you will say about the actual arguments that flatearthers make. It&#39;s much more interesting to see your response to these than to see you make up strawmen and then smack them down... anyone can do that and it.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Nobody said it has to be a huge conspiracy to make people believe it. The conspiracy is in the scientific community that has an issue with things that could be different than the idea they&#39;ve held for an extremely long time.</p></li>
<li><p>None of these <em>have</em> to be fake, the claim is about earth, not the other planets. Earth is a special frame of reference. You&#39;d be surprised how many &#39;pictures&#39; are actually renders as well. Even if this isn&#39;t totally on board.  Some of the conspiracy world somehow thinks that there are hundreds and thousands of people who are &#39;in on&#39; 9/11 and Sandy hook. That is much less believable that all of them are keeping quiet and not blowing the whole cover.</p></li>
<li><p>See #2 Mars can be round all it wants, Mars isn&#39;t earth.</p></li>
<li><p>Nobody with any sense says they are all fish eye lens. It&#39;s about perspective, circular (not fish eye) all lense are circular. I&#39;m not going to get extremely indepth because I don&#39;t have an hour to write on this 1 point, but the way vision works the way the horizon always ends in a singlar point, things above you on the horizon always look like they are going down into the horizon, below goes up... left right right left etc... It&#39;s a bit complex but rest assured it&#39;s not your strawman theory of &quot;fish eyed lens lelelele&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>This is only true if you use the math involved with the distances and orientations of the common held beliefs. If you shrink the sun by a huge magnitude and you move it much closer to the earth, and you understand the &#39;plane&#39; of earth is also moving... all the math works out perfectly fine.  For example, use gravity as an example... the math of gravity seems to work with 9.8m/s<sup><sup>2.</sup></sup> That&#39;s great, but the math also works <em>perfectly</em> if gravity on earth didn&#39;t exist, and the earth was moving upward at 9.8m/s. That is 2 situations, the math works with both.</p></li>
<li><p>This is just wrong actually, If you look at &quot;gravity&quot; as you will, or you look at the movement, it&#39;s not hard to understand that on vast distances, the movement or &#39;gravity&#39; of the earth would cause this to happen since the earth ends up moving into the path of the light, which means the bottom most parts of a very distant object, the light from those parts never makes it to your eye, it is blocked by the earth moving upward, the long the distance, the more time the earth moving can block out the bottom light reflected. Furthermore, when you aren&#39;t talking about vast distances, if you want to talk about distances of say, 1 mile where the earth isn&#39;t moving fast enough to block the light. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>This has been shown a number of times by a number of different people. The first investigation was carried out by Samuel Birley Rowbotham (1816-1884), the president of the Flat Earth Society, in the summer of 1838. He waded into the river and used a telescope held eight inches above the water to watch a boat with a five-foot mast row slowly away from him. He reported that the vessel remained constantly in his view for the full six miles to Welney bridge, whereas, had the water surface been curved with the accepted circumference of a spherical earth, the top of the mast should have been some eleven feet below his line of sight.</p>

<p>According to round earth, 1 mile away the earth should drop 8 inches, and this will be exponential, so at 2 miles it should be 32, 3 6 feet, 4 10 feet, 5 16 feet, and 6 24 feet. As you can see, the experiment would be impossible without the flat earth math. </p>

<p>Lastly #7... This is easy, and explained entirely if you shrink the sun to a smaller size and move it closer to earth, all the math works out perfectly fine and all the shadows work as well.</p>

<p>I fully realize that you are a troll of some sort and I am wasting my time, but what the hell. According to what you wrote, the curvature of the earth is 8 inches per mile at a distance of one mile (which is accurate), and 16 inches per mile at a distance of 2 miles (which is not). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you are saying you don&#39;t understand how to figure out the curvature of a sphere... but you somehow think the math.... that you don&#39;t know.... is wrong. I&#39;ll give you a hint... it&#39;s not wrong :)</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to assume that you honestly don&#39;t understand this, although it&#39;s a pretty easy concept. Your problem seems to be you don&#39;t understand curvature or exponential.</p>

<p>You accept the obvious that at a distance of 1 mile the curvature of a 25,000 mile sphere drops by 8 inches. Yet you then think that you can alter it by the second mile by claiming a &quot;per mile&quot; state, which you cannot do. That makes no sense.</p>

<p>It still works like this ...from point A to mile 1 is still 8 inch drop, from mile 1 to mile 2 is 24 inches, which means from point A to mile 2 is 32 inches. etc etc...</p>

<p>If you still can&#39;t understand that, then you probably should just forget about it and understand that since you accept 8 inches for the first mile, all you need to do for the rest is </p>

<p>mile = m</p>

<p>m<sup><sup><sup>2</sup></sup></sup> x 8 / 12 = curvature in feet</p>

<p>So... example..</p>

<p>10 miles</p>

<p>10<sup><sup>2</sup></sup> x 8 / 12 = 66 feet   </p>

<p>here we&#39;ll even do the one you seem to think is wrong.</p>

<p>2<sup><sup>2</sup></sup> x 8 = 32 inches we do not do the  division by 12 here because we dont want to convert to feet, we leave it in inches.</p>

<p>The curvature of a sphere cannot be anything even close to &quot;X per 1 Mile&quot; that is physically impossible. Do you not understand how stupid that is? Just think about it... honestly just give it even a slight thought.</p>

<p>If what you are claiming were true. At 1000 miles, the curvature of the earth would only drop around 600 feet. 1000 miles.... 600 feet.... You getting how silly that is?</p>

<p>It is a physical impossibility for it to be anything other than exponentially greater per 1 mile you gain. I honestly... I can&#39;t even believe I have to explain this extraordinarily basic geometry to you..</p>

<p>A real objective look at the subject exposes the fact that dinosaurs never existed. Not the big fantastical kinds anyway. There are no real skeletons available for you to look at, everything on display is just imitation casts. They will tell you that themselves. Next time you are in a museum with a dinosaur exhibit, see if you can find any actual skeletons of animals that aren&#39;t similar to things we have now, or very small.</p>

<p>This has nothing to do with religious belief. It is a very interesting subject to explore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please explain what you are trying to say.  I called out Nancy Leider because she is disinfo.  I don&#39;t want it grouped with flat earth because they are entirely different topics.</p>

<p>I have read quite a bit of Nancy Leider.  I fell down the whole aliens rabbithole for a couple of months.  Some fascinating stories, a mammoth effort goes into producing all that material.  But after spending enough time there I came to the conclusion that it was all bs.  Rockefeller money is behind the disclosure project.  There is technology that the public does not have access to, but it is not from aliens from outer space.</p>

<p>Flat earth is different.  If you spend less than 10 hours on the topic you do yourself a disservice.  If you actually look, but find the arguments lacking, that is one thing.  But if you never look, and strongly promote the conclusion that it is bs, don&#39;t you think that is a problem?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except the type of evidence for the two is completely different.  The convincing case for aliens is the enormous bulk of material over the years.  Newspaper stories from 100 years ago, convincing stories from many people.  The reason to believe it is the size of the conspiracy required to fake it.  If you have thought about aliens enough, in order to reject it, you must concede that there is a large, long term conspiracy in existence to produce the material.  Only people who reject aliens after looking through the evidence understand that.  Do you see the difference between that and the people refused to ever consider the topic of aliens?</p>

<p>Consider this in another way.  The people you know who believe the official story for 9/11, have they considered the evidence and found it lacking?  Or have they found ways to avoid looking at the evidence.  They know the conclusion is that their government is not benevolent so their brain does not allow them to see what is right in front of their faces: the official story cannot be true.  </p>

<p>Actually look at the evidence for flat earth.  You don&#39;t have to trust documents or someone&#39;s word on it.  You can perform experiments yourself if you want.  The spherical model falls apart pretty quickly when you actually look.  Proving another model 100% correct is entirely another matter.  But realize that the important part is that the current model does not work.  It&#39;s similar with 9/11: it isn&#39;t as important to prove another version 100% correct as it is to show that the official version is a lie and demand answers.</p>

<p>My own opinion is that the official spinning globe model we are given does not work.  I have not fully accepted an alternate model.  But to call it crazy at the outset, without looking, is problematic.  Especially when you have reached that point where you realize NASA is bs.</p>

<p>For instance, I need an uninterrupted flight from ground level to atmosphere exit with a planet facing camera before I can assume that the earth is flat. Also, the flat earth model proposed does not account for existing shots where not all landmasses are visible. If the earth was indeed flat, you would reach a point where every landmass was visible. That&#39;s not the case, so far as I&#39;ve seen. </p>

<p>And we&#39;ve known the globe model is inaccurate for decades, but that doesn&#39;t automatically indicate that the planet is flat in any sense.</p>

<p>This is absolutely true.  Proving the globe model incorrect does not directly prove that the earth is flat.  However flat is the best alternative model I have found so far.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the earth was indeed flat, you would reach a point where every landmass was visible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What tool do we have other than an amateur rocket or a balloon?  You can see videos of those on youtube.  They show that the horizon does not go below the camera level as you ascend.  That is a property of a flat plane.  I don&#39;t think one of these has gone high enough to show all landmasses.  That is something I would certainly like to see.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For instance, I need an uninterrupted flight from ground level to atmosphere exit with a planet facing camera before I can assume that the earth is flat.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What if this is not possible?  Ie, what if there is no reaching the end of the atmosphere?  We don&#39;t really know the nature of the sky and space.  We have to take the words of officials for it.</p>

<p>Or the property of a camera that hasn&#39;t left the atmosphere. I think flatearthers vastly underestimate the actual size of the earth. </p>

My conclusion is that there are huge problems with the official story, but that the consequences of informing people on that topic are a step further than this one.  You talk about flat earth, people just think you are crazy.  You get labelled anit-semetic and it really impacts your life.  It is entirely possible to describe the larger conspiracy without pushing the &quot;holocaust denial&quot; button and getting the vehement, programmed reaction.

<p>I encourage you to do your own research on flat earth.  No one else has to know.  The only risk you run is that you might be convinced by the arguments and then you would be forced to accept it.  You will likely be able to apply your experiences as a pilot in considering the arguments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a really interesting and highly organized campaign.  It&#39;s not just on reddit.</p>

<p>I have cited the &quot;flat earth&quot; wikipedia page several times over the years to point out that the phrase &quot;it&#39;s like a meeting of the flat earth society&quot; has a lot more interesting historical context than it&#39;s given credit for.  In the past few months, the SEO rankings and wiki pages have changed to show results which don&#39;t make it clear this was originally satire.</p>

<p>&quot;flat earther&quot; has been a derogatory phrase for &quot;anti-science&quot;/ &quot;conspiracy&quot; folks for a long time.  Before there was &quot;tin foil hat&quot;, there was &quot;flat earth&quot;.  </p>

<p>In the 18th century, the &quot;Flat Earth Society&quot; was a satirical group aimed at mocking religious and fanatic groups.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The myth that people in the Middle Ages thought the earth is flat appears to date from the 17th century as part of the campaign by Protestants against Catholic teaching. But it gained currency in the 19th century, thanks to inaccurate histories such as John William Draper&#39;s History of the Conflict Between Religion and Science (1874) and Andrew Dickson White&#39;s A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom (1896). <em>Atheists and agnostics championed the conflict thesis for their own purposes</em>, but historical research gradually demonstrated that Draper and White had propagated more fantasy than fact in their efforts to prove that science and religion are locked in eternal conflict</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myth_of_the_flat_Earth">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myth_of_the_flat_Earth</a></p>

<p>There is a more modern movement which has received some significant digital marketing of late, which is likely a parody similar to Robert Anton Wilsons Church of the Subgenius](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_the_SubGenius">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_the_SubGenius</a>).</p>

<p>This article about he current head of this &quot;group&quot; is somewhat telling in their attempt to use the concept as subversion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In fact, Shenton turns out to have resolutely mainstream views on most issues. The 33-year-old American, ­originally from Virginia but now living and working in London, is happy with the work of Charles Darwin. He thinks the evidence for man-made global warming is strong, and he dismisses suggestions that his own government was involved with the 9/11 terrorist attacks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have a point. My personal explanation why there are few <em>real</em> images of our Earth from distant space, is because we didnt reach that far for some reason. </p>

<p>All we have is some satellites going in circles in low Earth orbit and if I had to stretch my imagination, a telescope somewhere lost in space. (Hoomble) </p>

<p>Internet can function just fine even without satellites, we already use wireless towers and large cables across the Atlantic ocean.</p>

<p>Google earth is funded by alphabet soup &amp; images can be made by military planes photographing the Earth with that millionpixel camera technology I forgot the name of ***.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve got to admit the flat earth thing can be amusing for an hour. However, the lack of other images of earth is about the most surprising thing in the theory but they do exist. I think some of those nasa videos where they state we haven&#39;t gotten far into space and where they show the female astronauts perms are exacerbating this though. Yes from what I can see it does appear nasa needs to clear up some stuff and explain why some of their vids appear quite fake, but is this important to the current state of things? No. The whole horizon thing is interesting only from the far viewing standpoint if the curvature of the earth actually eclipses items in that way,(which other than one video I cant much else) but if memory serves doesn&#39;t light curve with the earth and its gravity? The fact the horizon doesn&#39;t change is simple perspective and if you&#39;ve ever drawn you know it doesn&#39;t mean squat as far as pointing to the shape of the earth though I can see how people would take something so simple and for granted and second guess themselves on what it means. I also find it interesting though that this whole thing has arisen in the conspiracy communities as such a critical time but whether its trolls or not let&#39;s focus on the more important issues like the impending TPP, Jade Helm, all the financial fuckery , and wars, and ignore this trivial matter. I never questioned the moon landing growing up and though now I have certainly seen plenty to make me doubt it I still file it under &quot;there is far more important stuff to worry about&quot; and that&#39;s where it will stay, piled high above but along with the flat earth theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course it sounds outlandish when you first hear it.  But you yourself just stated you &quot;vaguely looked&quot; at it.  You came to the conclusion that it was bullshit without actually investigating it.  The theory that it is intended to discredit conspiracy theorists is plausible, but is it actually the case?  It certainly does appear to be the majority opinion in this thread, but that also doesn&#39;t make it correct.</p>

<p>I urge you to actually look into it properly.  There are some disturbing questions about the spherical model we are given that cannot be explained away, except by techniques like this thread which encourage you to dismiss without looking.</p>

<p>It may not be the most important issue, but it does serve a purpose.  I have introduced it to some of my relatives, people not into conspiracy theory at all.  I presented them with the physical proof.  At the end they are left asking about the how and why of the coverup required for this.  They are instantly opened up to listening to important, pressing issues such as the &quot;global&quot; conspiracy required to pull it off.</p>

<p>Says the guy who is touting the value of Alex Jones!  That is hilarious.  Alex Jones is the most clear disinformation case there is.  He is the honeypot that people commonly fall into when they first get into conspiracies.  How long do people waste on his bs before they realize what he is?  And you are championing him and calling me a &quot;disinfo troll&quot;.  </p>

<p>All I&#39;m doing is asking people to consider evidence before dismissing, rather than accepting someone else&#39;s conclusion without ever looking for themselves.</p>

For instance, the gay marriage issue is another distraction and a surprisingly advantageous one at that. Half the states in America are pissed off right now. I Personally support it but the way it happened clearly showed everyone that we no longer live in a democracy. It was a statement. Just like pot legalization will be. And just like an announcement of &quot;others&quot; will be. Just like Jade Helm will be. I digress, we won&#39;t be able to realistically KNOW the nature of the universe until we pull together, and pull the elites down to our level.

    <div class="md"><p>To my mind, the Flat Earth theory is a fascinating phenomenon. As far as I know, it stands alone as a theory which uses most if not all evidence to the contrary to actually support its conclusion.</p>

<p>A massive coverup on the part of NASA and the scientific community as a whole, as well as all air traffic control infrastructure and international governments.</p>

<p>To me, that&#39;s what creates the cognitive dissonance, and would stand as the most convincing factor to their agenda.</p>

<p>Last week, I decided that I needed to know more about these theories. So I sat down and watched several hours of interviews and, well <em>monologues</em> I guess on YouTube. </p>

<p>The overarching consensus, is that The Earth is the ONLY physical thing in the Universe. Everything else &#39;revolves&#39; around it. The Sun and Moon are the same size and only about 3,000 miles away.</p>

<p>Observationally, from our terrestrial perspective this is difficult to disprove, provided you take into account absolutely NONE of the past thousand years&#39; scientific revelations.</p>

<p>But the kicker for me, is that these proselytizers of the Flat Earth are VERY quick to label anyone who might not agree with them as &#39;in on it&#39;: pessimist narcissists, atheists and dupes..</p>

<p>Now, do I think that official narratives are 100% truthful? Obviously not. Do I think gravity works in exactly the way we think it does? No. Do I think that some space exploration footage is fake? Yes. Is space as a thing what we think it is? We honestly don&#39;t know enough to say.</p>

<p>But do I think all these things are so because The Earth is flat? ABSOLUTELY NOT!</p>

<p>But that&#39;s how they&#39;re gaining traction in communities like these--They&#39;re exploiting holes in our collective experience and awareness.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>they have perfected bullshitting looong time ago. They&#39;ve been mixing truth and lies for the exact purpose of discrediting conspiracies. The word Conspiracy itself is a concocted word to make it look like it&#39;s bullshit.</p>

<p>Also, you don&#39;t know if the earth is flat. You don&#39;t REALLY know until you see it yourself, and you can&#39;t see it with your naked eye, unless you can go up like 30-40k feet. Commercial planes go up to 35k feet and you might see some curvature, however look at the windows. They are all fisheye glass and therefore bend the corners. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think we live on a flat earth, but to rebuke the idea after &quot;vaguely skimming through&quot; is just silly and inappropriate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have posted this response in another topic but it also fits in here very well:</p>

<p>I think this all goes a bit deeper. To be honest right from the beginning, I am a round earth believer and I know that not all flat earth believers are stupid (not everyone is parrotting nonsense s/he heard from a friend which read something on the internet what a friend saw on youtube). I think this all is just part of a huge controlled disinformation campaign in order to make people resistant for the upcoming disclosure and the massive information dump which is to come linked to this. Because if one gets the masses to disbelief in science and get them to not being able to distinguish honest and true science from fakes, then the masses also won’t believe in disclosure and other true informations coming out. Lots of us are looking for informations, and at some point you will come across the illuminati &amp; cabal groups, and if you are up to date you’ll probably know about the sphere alliance and the SSP’s. It is obvious (at least to me and many others) that the cabal groups have infiltrated the conspiracy theorists and it seems this is all well prepared. People around the globe are slowly waking up and are realizing that somethings not right here. People know that NASA, our politicians, the media, schools and what have you weren’t always truthful and honest. So I believe that this huge disinformation effort is to discredit science with the weaopns of the conspiracy theorists. It is basically their last stand because they know if that doesn’t work they, the cabal group, will be history. But no matter what, this time they’ll lose anyway. I have read a lot about flat earth theory and in every forum, and on youtube etc. at some point the flat earthers are fighting fiercly with the round earthers about their beliefs. This tactic is old, very old and it seems to work on us almost every time unless someone notices it. Not only on this topic but also on many others. Get the people to fight each other so they don’t care about the one initiating all of this. I think what we should focus on is prevent this useless namecalling, fighting, insulting and so on because aggression does not get you anywhere in this discussion. No one knows everything and the one who claims to know everything is a liar. Only full disclosure is real disclosure and anything other than that will be orchestrated by the cabal groups. Its as easy as that. Technically we could be much further than we are at the moment and if the real full disclosure occurs we have to be able to distinguish the fake from the real thing.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to start to explain details of this because I wouldn&#39;t be able to do this as good as the ones who are doing this for years. But I can provide some links so you can research for yourself.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to but in here. You started off well in this sub, but I&#39;m starting to find your attitude a little disappointing. <strong>The default position on this subreddit is that conspiracies exist, and it is not your job to stifle discussion of such theories and shame their proponents.</strong> People discuss lots of different conspiracy theories in this sub and if you don&#39;t like a particularly conspiracy theory, you can add to the discussion by calmly and politely setting out evidence to the contrary. </p>

<p>You will just have to accept that some people believe (or appear to espouse) conspiracies that you think are completely off the wall. Imputing nefarious motives to everyone who believes those theories is not helpful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, but it is very hard to know if flat earthers are genuine believers or trolls, because some people believe really weird conspiracies. For instance, I despair of anyone  who believes in one of those ludicrous supernatural entities called &quot;gods&quot;, but I don&#39;t accuse faithists of pretending to believe that shit to make <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> &quot;look bad&quot; (even though I think it does).</p>

<p>A lot of trolls come to this subreddit to denigrate regular users. We really don&#39;t need regular users doing the same, because internal divisions are more dangerous to this sub than outsiders&#39; opinions. </p>

<p>Add: My personal philosophy I try to adhere to (not that anybody cares, but I think it&#39;s a good one) is not to criticise anybody personally, unless that person has <strong>explicitly</strong> attacked me, other users or (what I perceive to be) the ethos of this sub. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The most simple question i would ask all the flat earth &quot;believers&quot; is that if the earth would be flat, (which it isn&#39;t) then what is at the edge? Do you think it&#39;s a edge, that you fall into space? And if you think it&#39;s a edge, why haven&#39;t anyone noticed it? Also our oceans, dont you think they would poor out if it were an edge?</p>

<p>Just need to add that if you jump onto your motorcycle and drive in a as straight line you could, you will end up where you started, is that a scenario that would work on your flat earth?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.  Controlled opposition is a standard tactic in any arena.  If you can infiltrate the place where people go when they disagree with the official story then you get to control the narrative on the alternative and get an easy list of who is against you.  &quot;Cointelpro&quot; is a good topic to research if you never have.  It is a sort of admitted false flag so a description is found on wikipedia: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO</a></p>

<p>Combine that with the more current information about official security service operations online, in social media:  <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2014/07/eglin-air-force-base-busted-gaming-reddit.html">http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2014/07/eglin-air-force-base-busted-gaming-reddit.html</a><br/>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s so disappointing to watch this sub circle jerk itself.</p>

<p>You people aren&#39;t skeptics. You&#39;re just the next iteration of groupthinking tribalists.</p>

<p>I promise you. No one gives a good fuck what people think about this sub or conspiracy theory in general.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll entertain Retillians and UFO&#39;s on flimsy evidence but you won&#39;t take a hard look at the very real and troubling round earth dilemmas? </p>

<p>It&#39;s pathetic. </p>

<p>Ask why you can see for miles past the supposed curvature of this round earth? Oh it&#39;s atmospheric refraction reflecting thousands of feet of landscape perfectly into view. Right...</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying I know anything for sure, but if you just dismiss that evidence out of hand because science handed you a magical explanation, you&#39;re not a skeptic, you just have a belief system you believe is rooted in fact. It&#39;s a new type of faith, call it what you want. But that&#39;s what it is.</p>

<p>Anyone who clings to a belief without seriously evaluating the evidence and denounces dissenting opinion is a religious bigot. </p>

<p>That&#39;s all I have to say.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s just a way of muddying the waters. It&#39;s actually more difficult to prove the Earth is a sphere than you would think. Especially because the flat Earth proponents have a very strong case from debates that happened hundreds of years ago.</p>

<p>The best way to show people the flat Earth concept is false is to show images which can be easily attained by inexpensive cameras and telescopes anyone can acquire. You can see that the moon is a sphere by the craters and how they change shape close to the curve of the moon. The flat Earthers claim the moon is not an actual spherical body and that meteorites aren&#39;t real.</p>

<p>I also suspect these flat earthers are scammers or disinfo because they should have figured that out at least by now.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t.  Antarctica / South Pole is off limits. The go on the edge of Antarctica, look into operation Highjump led by Admiral Byrd and you will see for yourself many weird things that happened when they led those expeditions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I said I vaguely looked at the Flat earth theory and wasn&#39;t an authority on debunking it. Im still open minded and (when I have time) will look into it more. I just think that it&#39;s a little suspicious how it just sprang up out of nowhere. If I was tasked with marginalizing conspiracy theorists, I would most likely do it with a blitzkrieg of disinformation dispersed throughout places where truth seekers congregate ... like here for example. Im not on some anti flat earth crusade, Im just (by nature) skeptical and think that its plausible that it could be a psy-op. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Would you like me to continue with Alex Jones and why he is a disinfo agent, or to defend myself against your accusation that I am a disinfo agent?  You provided no evidence, only the statement, so there isn&#39;t much for me to rebut there.</p>

<p>Continuing with Alex Jones is not difficult, but it is offtopic to this thread.  I just thought it was funny that you called me out as disinfo while supporting the most obvious example of disinfo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well then our views aren&#39;t that far apart.  I am not defaulting to the flat earth model.  I just think it is the most plausible of those I have seen.  Do you have another alternate model that you think is more plausible than the standard flat earth model?</p>
