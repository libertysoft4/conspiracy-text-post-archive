    <div class="md"><p>Regular posters here know why you have a bee in your bonnet over my comments. You&#39;ve admitted that you are black, and I make comments critical of blacks. You have an emotional need to defend your race against criticism, even when the criticism is honest and accurate.</p>

<p>Within the past year or two I&#39;ve realized quite clearly that blacks contribute almost nothing to America, but are an enormous drain and burden on the nation&#39;s resources. Affirmative action, which puts unqualified blacks into job positions that whites are prevented from obtaining, is only one of the more egregious injustices that have been forced upon the white majority. Far more harmful is the willful blindness to the inherent lower intelligence of the black race. Blacks in America are 15-20 IQ points below the intelligence of whites, on average. Blacks in sub-Saharan Africa (the negro part of Africa) are 30 IQ points below whites.</p>

<p>By pretending to blacks that they are capable of doing the same work as whites, the liberal elite is giving them false hope and inflating their egos. Blacks will never be able to achieve at the same level as whites. Never. They are genetically limited by their low intelligence, and by other recognized qualities in the black race, such as a higher aggression, a lack of impulse control, a tendency to unmotivated violence, and an inability to plan ahead.</p>

<p>My point in making comments like this is that we need to look at blacks realistically, if we are ever going to help them out of their cultural cesspool. Simply throwing money at &quot;black leaders&quot; to spend on themselves is not helping. Throwing money at the schools isn&#39;t  helping. We need to have a clear understanding of what blacks are capable of, as a race. Only from a position of reality can effective social planning occur.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Regular posters here know why you have a bee in your bonnet over my comments.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely they do - and it’s because, as I’ve made no issue about mentioning several times over, your closed-minded, ignorant mentality is, in great part, what is responsible for perpetuating the very problems you talk about wanting to remedy.  It’s unfortunate that this continues to be utterly lost upon you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;ve admitted that you are black, and I make comments critical of blacks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am mixed race, am proud to be such, and I have exactly zero problem saying such.  I am no more European than I am native than I am African.  I literally have <em>all</em> of those genotypes in me.</p>

<p>So which one <em>am</em> I then?  Which one did I “admit” to being?  I am not offended when you disparage blacks.  I am offended when you disparage <em>anyone</em> because you are disparaging not only yourself, but the entirety of the human race.  You are a cancer to proper, healthy thinking because you contribute to the ignorant malignancy which has been responsible for untold horror throughout human history.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have an emotional need to defend your race against criticism, even when the criticism is honest and accurate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I point out that your thought processes are ignorant when your very words demonstrably portray you as such.  There is nothing emotional about that - much as you might try to otherwise convince yourself.  People with a mentality like yours have been responsible for ensuring that the entirety of the human race remains at odds with one another and remains subjugated and enslaved.</p>

<p>As I’ve said many times before, your very actions and mentality actually <em>ensure</em> that your own race remains subjugated.  The irony of this is apparently entirely lost upon you.  Shouldn’t someone with a supposedly “higher IQ” know this?  Shouldn’t somebody like me - who is mixed with supposedly “inferior blood” - <em>not</em> know this?</p>

<p>Your posts are hardly worthy of addressing, and I understand that their intellectual bankruptcy is the likely reason why you’ve never bothered responding after I point it out, instead choosing to slunk away like a coward.  </p>

<p>When I say you are a detriment to the white race and an embarrassment to humanity in general, I say this with cold, hard, intellectual calculation, as it is a simple fact.  There is nothing emotional about letting it be known that you yourself prove some white people are exceedingly inferior intellectually speaking, and - as such - <em>no</em> race has a monopoly on worthiness above any other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jews own the media in America and have a huge presence in high finance, academia, and they play a dominant role in policy formation. They are hostile to the values, interests, beliefs, and people who have comprised the demographic majority in the Western world. This is what makes them dangerous: it is not that they are greedy and selfish, but rather that they are highly cohesive, retain a sense of elite group consciousness, and implement policies that are destructive to the majority peoples in the west. Jews were the driving force that pushed America to fight a war in Iraq and a major force in pushing America to fight two World Wars in Europe. They are the main reason why America backs the apartheid racial ethno-state of Israel. They are the the promoters of anti-white policies like affirmative action (which saddles corporations with incompetent and unproductive employees) and promotion of &quot;diversity&quot; (fewer Whites) in every workplace. They are pushing to replace the demographic majority in the first world with alien peoples who are hostile to whites through unrestrained third world immigration. Their media presence is used to promote values and attitudes that are destructive to the majority of Americans.</p>
