        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I honestly had no idea this had happened until a thread started to blow up in <a href="/r/Outoftheloop">/r/Outoftheloop</a>: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3bw39q/why_has_riama_been_set_to_private/">Why has R/Iama been set to private?</a></p>

<p>As someone who has more than a few years&#39; experience in PR and advertising, this is a logical step in the monetization of Reddit. I&#39;ve watched <a href="/r/IAMA">/r/IAMA</a> evolve over the years, and where a celebrity used to pop in once in a while, that sub eventually became the digital PR hub for marketing new movies, albums, book releases, etc. to millennial men. </p>

<p>Think about it - you have an engaged audience and a celebrity with millions of dollars riding behind the thing they&#39;re coming to talk about. It was only a matter of time before the new Reddit owners decided they needed a chunk of that cash flow.</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3bw39q/why_has_riama_been_set_to_private/csq204d">Post by /u/karmanaut</a> in the <a href="/r/Outoftheloop">/r/Outoftheloop</a> thread: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Today, we learned that Victoria was unexpectedly let go from her position with Reddt. We all had the rug ripped out from under us and feel betrayed.</p>

<p>Before doing that, the admins really should have at least talked to us (and all the other subs that host AMAs, like <a href="/r/Books">/r/Books</a>, <a href="/r/Science">/r/Science</a>, <a href="/r/Music">/r/Music</a>, etc.) We had a number of AMAs scheduled for today that Victoria was supposed to help with, and they are all left absolutely high and dry (hence taking IAMA private to figure out the situation) She was still willing to help them today (before the sub was shut down, of course) even without being paid or required to do so. Just a sign of how much she is committed to what she does.</p>

<p>The admins didn&#39;t realize how much we rely on Victoria. Part of it is proof, of course: we know it&#39;s legitimate when she&#39;s sitting right there next to the person and can make them provide proof. We&#39;ve had situations where agents or others have tried to do an AMA as their client, and Victoria shut that shit down immediately. We can&#39;t do that anymore.</p>

<p>Part of it is also that Victoria is an essential lifeline of communication. When something goes wrong in an AMA, we can call and get it fixed immediately. Otherwise, we have to resort to desperately try messaging the person via Reddit (and they may not know to check their messages or even to look for these notifications). Sometimes we have to resort to shit like this (now with a screenshot because I can&#39;t link to that anymore for you) where we have to nuke an entire submission just so that the person is aware of the problem.</p>

<p>Part of it is also organization. The vast majority of scheduling requests go through her and she ensures that we have all of the standard information that we need ahead of time (date, time, proof, description, etc.) and makes it easier for the teams that set up AMAs on both ends. She ensures that things will go well and that the person understands what <a href="/r/IAMA">/r/IAMA</a> is and what is expected of them. Without her filling this role, we will be utterly overwhelmed. We might need to scrap the calendar altogether, or somehow limit AMAs from those that would need help with the process.</p>

<p>We have been really blindsided by all of this. As a result, we will need to go through our processes and see what can be done without her.</p>

<p>Tl;dr: for <a href="/r/IAMA">/r/IAMA</a> to work the way it currently does, we need Victoria. Without her, we need to figure out a different way for it to work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It feels like reddit is shooting itself in the foot to us, but we&#39;re not the typical reddit users anymore. Reddit used to be a place where you could find like minded individuals to discuss important things in your life. Now it&#39;s a place to find pictures of cats and memes.</p>

<p>And I think reddit is OK with that. If it means 15% less traffic and 40% more revenue, that&#39;s great for them.</p>

<p>People like my girlfriend who treat reddit like a facebook feed, a place to find some mindless fun to pass some time, are not going to be put off by these changes unless someone like me, a person looking for intellectual stimulation and a place to discuss my concerns and interests explains to her why this place sucks. And even after I do that she&#39;ll probably still log back into <a href="/r/awww">/r/awww</a> to see some more pics.</p>

<p>You are 100% right. Community, conversation, quality of content, user participation - those are intangible reasons that we love this site. But they don&#39;t make money. And unfortunately, Aaron Swartz isn&#39;t running the ship anymore, so money is all that seems to matter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sort of. Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian founded reddit in summer of 2005 as part of YCombinator&#39;s first batch of startups. Aaron Swartz had his own startup in that batch called <a href="http://infogami.org/">Infogami</a>, which later <a href="http://www.redditblog.com/2006/02/infogami.html">merged with reddit</a> and powered reddit&#39;s wiki for a while. He was a co-founder of the merged company, but reddit was already operating for about half a year when he came onboard.</p>

<p>I&#39;m inclined to agree with <a href="/u/raldi">/u/raldi</a> - <a href="/u/aaronsw">/u/aaronsw</a> was never steering the ship.</p>

<p>Aaron was a major influence on the site&#39;s rewriting into Python, and its adoption of Markdown, and he made some genuine technical contributions beyond that as well. But he certainly never did anything that could remotely be considered running the ship.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, I can elaborate: In the AMA with Jesse Jackson <a href="/u/huhasklkdasdpo">/u/huhasklkdasdpo</a> asked: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Jackson,
You are an immoral, hate-filled race baiter that has figured out how to manipulate the political system for your own gain. You&#39;ve personally set back race relations year after year and continue to do more harm than good. Extorting money from companies to line your pockets and threatening to bus in protestors and create a fake racial controversy if they don’t agree to pay you off is NOT civil rights activism. My question is simple; how is your relationship with the illegitimate child you fathered in 1998 while cheating on your wife? Bonus question: How much money have you extorted from various people and companies over the years of practicing your shakedown scheme? Do you think Al Capone would be jealous of your business model if he were still alive?</p>

<p>Now his profile is not accessable so I assume he got shadowbanned?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>new to the the sub (lurker and all) and not one prone to conspiracies, but could the shutdown/chaos have anything to do with this: <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2015/02/02/reddits-valuation-becomes-issue-in-ellen-pao-lawsuit-against-kleiner/">Reddit Valuation Becomes Issue in Ellen Pao Lawsuit at Kleiner</a>?</p>

<p>particularly this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Kleiner’s attorney cited in court press coverage that said the company [Reddit] was worth about $500 million, a number that was reported during a recent funding round.</p>

<p>Ms. Pao’s attorneys said they have an expert who has valued the company at about half that.</p>

<p>If Ms. Pao stands to earn as much or more at Reddit, based on the value of her shares in the company, as she would have working at Kleiner, it could offset the damages Kleiner would have to pay if she wins her lawsuit.</p>

<p>Ms. Hermle, Kleiner’s attorney, said the venture capital firm has provided detailed information on the valuations of private companies it has funded so that Ms. Pao could calculate her damages. She said Kleiner deserves the same level of detail from Reddit and Ms. Pao.</p>

<p>Ms. Pao’s attorney Alan Exelrod said the legal team doesn’t have enough details from Reddit, a private company that doesn’t disclose its financials, to be more precise than the roughly $250 million figure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you take out a lynchpin and watch a system fall apart, investors are going to get squeamish and think you have no control over your business.</p>

<p>The valuation of the company goes down because few investors/advertisers want to put money into platform that can be taken down by hundreds of pissed off moderators (for whatever good reason they may have to shift a sub to private), and the poor practices of your administrative team go on display for the world to see (the failure to update tools, the aging scripts being used, etc.).</p>

<p>To me, shilling is infinitely worse when someone is trying to mislead me into thinking that their perspective about the product/celebrity/film/album they&#39;re peddling is just a genuine endorsement from an average person.</p>

<p>Sure, Victoria made some money helping celebs market their shit, but we all knew what was happening. Nobody was being misled. </p>
