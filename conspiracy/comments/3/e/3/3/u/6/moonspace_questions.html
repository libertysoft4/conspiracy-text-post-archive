        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>One conspiracy that fascinates me is whether or not we really went to the moon. Not sure what to believe. Questions I have:</p>

<p>Are there any other photos of the landing area/tracks/flag on the moon besides the one NASA provided? Supposedly you can see this from your back yard, but I can find 0 pics of it besides NASA pics. </p>

<p>Has any private attempt been successful so far to even get into space? I remember the Elon Musk test a few weeks back fucking exploded. </p>

<p>What&#39;s the best doc proving we went? The best doc proving we didnt?</p>

<p>Are there any pics Nasa has taken of a planet that has stars? Not sure why that&#39;s so important to me. I was highly disappointed in the Pluto pics. </p>

<p>Does the Japanese Rover video of the Earth from the Moon look fake as fuck to anyone else? Any clue as to why?</p>

<p>China is planning a moonbase on the dark side of the moon apparently. Is this move political towards the US? &quot;We know you didn&#39;t go up there you bastards&quot;. </p>

<p>Looking for that jaw-dropping &quot;holy facking shite&quot; proof either way. In my opinion, both the proof we went and the proof we didn&#39;t both have issues. Makes things confusing. Maybe that&#39;s the point.</p>

<p>Thanks! </p>

<p>EDIT: Really enjoying the replies guys, thanks! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My recent experience is this.</p>

<p>-I believed we went to the moon. (I watched it live on TV).</p>

<p>-I had doubts when I saw the Apollo 13 landing capsule in a space museum. The technology looks like high school science fair.</p>

<p>-9/11 convinced me we live in an illusory world.</p>

<p>-I stopped believing we went to the moon.</p>

<p>-If we didn&#39;t go to the moon, is it because it is too far away? or because it is too close?</p>

<p>-I am currently entertaining a flat earth... my mind is going where it has never gone before :)</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you are going to find a silver bullet in all of this, but you can certainly weigh the evidence and draw your own conclusion.</p>

<p>It&#39;s quite possible that the moon landings were faked (but I don&#39;t get why Russians are silent about this), but there&#39;s too much proof of Earth not being flat.</p>

<p>You can actually verify this yourself if you have a sniper rifle (coriolis effect), or if you have access to a spacious building (Foucault pendulum).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When every piece of verifiable evidence that is presented to support the contrary to the argument is supposedly &quot;faked&quot; or &quot;propaganda&quot;, then the flat earth theory cannot be considered to be anything but blind faith. You might as well start calling the suppression/skepticism of religion a conspiracy. &quot;God DOES exist! Leaked CIA files confirm&quot; is a headline that&#39;s just as legitimate as &quot;Earth is FLAT. What the Powers That Be DON&#39;T want you to know.&quot; </p>

<p>Tell me. Why is every observable celestial body in the sky spherical? Why can&#39;t you see the entire surface of the Earth if it really is flat? I should be able to see China from Canada, but I can&#39;t, because the Earth is not flat. We&#39;ve known it was round long before we went into space. Also, if the Earth is flat, what&#39;s on the other side? That&#39;s a question I&#39;ve yet to see answered. </p>

<p>I cannot wait until commercial space flight is available, because it will conclude an entire chapter of human stupidity when they go up and see the Earth is fucking round. </p>

<p>You see, there is a big difference between conspiracies like flat earth and say, JFK. The difference being, there is literally zero motivation to lie about the shape of the Earth. Who would propagate such lies? How can you even blame Satan loving Nazi-NASA when there are other space programs around the world with satellite imagery of the Earth of their own? Even if this theory was religiously motivated, where in the Bible does it say the Earth is flat? Oh right, it <a href="http://www.gotquestions.org/flat-earth-Bible.html">doesn&#39;t</a>. </p>

<p>Flat earth is a joke that went too far and people believe in it because &quot;the Powers That Be want to shut your brain off from critical thinking&quot;. I literally heard a flat earth theorist say: &quot;If you DO see a curve in the Earth, it&#39;s because you&#39;ve been brainwashed your whole life into thinking its round so your mind is playing tricks on you.&quot; What a load of bullshit. You know what? I have a theory of my own. You see, the grass is actually blue and the sky is green. You&#39;ve just been brainwashed into thinking the opposite. Why? Because REASONS! </p>

<p>I can tolerate people thinking we didn&#39;t go to the moon. However I think we did, found shit all and realized it was hardly worth going back because there is nothing of value to us up there. But FLAT EARTH?? Give me a break.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Crrow777 channel on YouTube covers a lot about the moon. It may not be much but a starting point for his coverings of the moon being a hologram. Not saying there isn&#39;t anything there, just something covering it up. On the channel he also talks about that we never go above low earth orbit, giving credence that the moon landing couldn&#39;t have been possible. Something to check out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have dug into them; they make a lot of sense. </p>

<p>Have you read the entire piece? All examples of secondary lighting in the photography? The pictures of obviously unpressurized suits? The size of the landing capsule compared to all the material that would needed to be brought with them? All the missing video? The way the original video was transmitted? The interesting correlation between aggressive US military action on the ground in Vietnam and moon shots? </p>

<p>Eisenhower warned us: Everything was in danger of being taken over by the MIC; once JFK was murdered, it was. NASA is part of it; a huge black hole for money, while they fool the country with special FX. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, instead of aiming for the stars, they&#39;ve dug a huge network of tunnels and buildings underground. It&#39;s the classic &quot;do the opposite of what we&#39;re saying,&quot; in country that&#39;s now all lies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>On my phone for the day, so quoting and formatting is a pain in the arse but I&#39;ll hit a few points. </p>

<p>If there was a secondary light source, each object would cast two shadows. There&#39;s only one shadow per object so it&#39;s clearly just one light source. </p>

<p>People get all bent out of shape because the shadows appear to change direction - what they fail to realise is shadows can change direction, just look at shadows on a flight of stairs. Shadows will change direction depending on the shape of whatever they&#39;re cast on. </p>

<hr/>

<p>The author makes an error about the size of the capsule because  he claims there&#39;s no room for things like a toilet and other gizmo&#39;s involved in human waste containment. The error is in that the astronauts toilets consisted of a few bags, not some bulky sanitation unit. </p>

<p>So that&#39;s just a straw man. </p>

Once you have a good foundation of knowledge there&#39;s a lot more out there on the subject.</p>

<p>One of the biggest tells to me is the lack of any delay whatsoever between the astronauts and mission control in any of the videos.  There should have been a noticeable 2+ second delay between every reply for the sound to travel from Moon to Earth and back again, yet no delay is audible in any of the recordings (aside from what you hear in normal speech when a person is thinking or has nothing to say).</p>

<p>Are there any other photos of the landing area/tracks/flag on the moon besides the one NASA provided? Supposedly you can see this from your back yard, but I can find 0 pics of it besides NASA pics. </p>

<p>The Moon is 238,900 miles from Earth.  So nobody can see the landing area/tracks/flag on the Moon&#39;s surface from their backyard.</p>

<p>A reason the photos of those things come from NASA is because the Moon is so far away that a space craft outfitted with a camera has to be sent close enough to snap a picture.</p>
