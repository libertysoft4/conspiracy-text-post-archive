<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Lavon Affair</strong> refers to a failed Israeli covert operation, code named Operation Susannah, conducted in Egypt in the Summer of 1954. As part of the false flag operation,[1] a group of Egyptian Jews were recruited by Israeli military intelligence to plant bombs inside Egyptian, American and British-owned civilian targets, cinemas, libraries and American educational centers. The bombs were timed to detonate several hours after closing time. The attacks were to be blamed on the Muslim Brotherhood, Egyptian Communists, &quot;unspecified malcontents&quot; or &quot;local nationalists&quot; with the aim of creating a climate of sufficient violence and instability to induce the British government to retain its occupying troops in Egypt&#39;s Suez Canal zone.[2] The operation caused no casualties, except for operative Philip Natanson, when a bomb he was taking to place in a movie theater ignited prematurely in his pocket; for two members of the cell who committed suicide after being captured; and for two operatives who were tried, convicted and executed by Egypt.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>This only started once this sub got big. I clearly remember it here before there  were even 100k subscribers.... Criticism of Israel, Zionism, APAIC, was common of course, and completely valid. But the stuff going on now is a whole different animal. What we have now is predominately about creating bad optics for this sub. Pissing in the waters, trying to destroy credibility, turn off curious newcomers, etc. There is a big difference between the above criticisms and what we see here today, especially all the holocaust denier stuff. A lot of the general race-baiter content is coming from the same source. They try to make it look legit, but it&#39;s clearly a campaign and I see right through. Whenever I point this out, those are my most heavily downvoted comments. I could care less lol. When you are pointing out truth, TPTB will run well-funded, multi-pronged campaigns to discredit you. This is ONE of those prongs, nothing more. Be vigilant, downvote the crap. You have to be able to split hairs, as there are plenty of valid criticisms of the aforementioned. It&#39;s subtle (sometimes not) but it&#39;s a campaign to discredit, nothing more.</p>

<p>There has always been racist elements in some conspiracy theories, dating back to things like the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, leading all the way up to people like &quot;Birthers&quot;. </p>

<p>Just because you or most of the people here don&#39;t hold racist views doesn&#39;t mean other conspiracy theorists can&#39;t. In fact, in my experience, racists need to come up with all sorts of theories to justify their positions and the reason why they are so hated amongst the rest of the community.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a couple of videos/articles that factor in to why people don&#39;t like Zionism:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Israeli lobbyist calling for a false flag: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M84l19H68mk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M84l19H68mk</a></p></li>
<li><p>Barbarra Spectre talking about the &quot;diversity problem&quot; in Sweden: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFE0qAiofMQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFE0qAiofMQ</a></p></li>
<li><p>Joel Stein bragging about how Jews run all the major institutions in this country although being such a minority: <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2008/dec/19/opinion/oe-stein19">http://articles.latimes.com/2008/dec/19/opinion/oe-stein19</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>And finally, even though it&#39;s called the &quot;most anti-semitic book in history&quot;, the <a href="http://ddickerson.igc.org/The_Protocols_of_the_Learned_Elders_of_Zion.pdf">Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion</a> describe the exact current state of our society and it was written (or forged) in 1905. Some points and goals that you can read in the Protocols:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Establishing a &quot;Jewish Palestine&quot; as a first step to reclaiming the entire middle east. (Written 40 years before Israel was established)</p></li>
<li><p>Controlling the media and only allowing social subjects to be &quot;topics of the day&quot; and never allow monetary or war policy to be seriously debated.</p></li>
<li><p>The establishment of a central banking system that always lends but never takes a loan. Through usury, the loanee will always lose his property and self-sufficiency.</p></li>
<li><p>The breaking down of culture through &quot;fairness doctrines&quot; &quot;equality&quot; and &quot;diversification&quot;. Making the cultural heritage of your enemy taboo or embarrassing for them.</p></li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>The Protocols is a fabricated document purporting to be factual. Textual evidence shows that it was transcribed by a speaker of Ukrainian and could not have been produced prior to 1901.</p>

<p>It is notable that the title of Serge Nilus&#39;s widely distributed edition contains the dates &quot;1902-1903&quot;, and it is likely that the document was actually written at this time in Russia, despite Nilus&#39; attempt to cover this up by inserting French-sounding words into his editio</p>
