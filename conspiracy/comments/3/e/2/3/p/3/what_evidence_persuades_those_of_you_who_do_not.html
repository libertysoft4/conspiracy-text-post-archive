        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I believe in some conspiracies. I believe that there is definitely more to 9/11 than we are being told. I believe that the subsequent cover-ups and the way 9/11 was handled, along with the fact that the buildings collapsed when clearly they should not have done so is sufficient evidence of this. </p>

<p>I also tend to believe that the government is controlled by big business and the news medias are also controlled by big business, therefore we are all under the &quot;control&quot; and are being brainwashed via media and other outlets by those large corporations. (This is more or less a fact, than a conspiracy)</p>

<p>All of that aside, I do believe we landed on the moon. I believe that a hoax of that magnitude would just be too difficult to pull off in the way that it was done. I also believe if you take into account all the physical aspects of it, it was definitely possible and that it was done. However, I do see the motivation behind hoaxing it. We were in the Cold War with the Soviet Union. There was an enormous amount of pressure from the space race. The tax payers had to see that their tax dollars were amounting for something in all of that spending, etc. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve just finished watching the documentary &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon&quot; and a lot of the evidence they give is quite compelling, but there is a deep religious undertone to the overall theme of the documentary and it&#39;s just off-putting. It makes me feel as though their motivations are more to put religion over science, rather than to just prove or disprove the moon landing.</p>

<p>So, I ask you, people of reddit: What is the strongest evidence, for you personally, that persuades those of you who do not believe that the United States landed people on the moon?</p>

<p>Edit:: Here is a link to the documentary that I was talking about. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xciCJfbTvE4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xciCJfbTvE4</a></p>

<p>Edit #2:: The very most compelling piece of evidence from the link above comes at this time:

    <div class="md"><p>That also strikes me as odd, however it could be put off as just &quot;we already went&quot; and there&#39;s nothing to be gained from going back as it would cost a lot of tax dollars and NASA&#39;s budget has been exceedingly cut over recent years. I do see where you&#39;re coming from. </p>

<p>Also, one would think that we of course would have the technology to almost nullify the adverse effects of that radiation belt by now. Could the same be said for the technology of that time, however? Very interesting..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m reaching the edges of my knowledge here, but I believe it has more to do with the thickness &amp; metal type of the shielding. There really isn&#39;t a magic solution to blocking radiation -- lead would work very well but is too heavy so they used an inch or two of an aluminum alloy. I&#39;ve heard it said that deep space travel is infeasible because the hull of the ship would have to be coated in several feet worth of lead -- too heavy to lift off. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am on your side, I believe that we went to the moon but I am fascinated by conspiracy theories. I think that some of the modt compelling questions come from issues with the photographs from Apollo 11. Lack of stars, wind, strange angles etc. </p>

<p>Also, we seem to be able to point a telescope to other galaxies and get some amazing pictures, but I have never seen a picture of the moon landing site taken from Earth or earth orbit. If I had a powerful telescope, that&#39;s the first thing I would look for! </p>

I said, I don&#39;t subscribe to the moon hoax conspiracies, but I do find them interesting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me, it is this quote.</p>

<p>“It is commonly believed that man will fly directly from the earth to the moon, but to do this, we would require a vehicle of such gigantic proportions that it would prove an economic impossibility. It would have to develop sufficient speed to penetrate the atmosphere and overcome the earth’s gravity and, having traveled all the way to the moon, it must still have enough fuel to land safely and make the return trip to earth. Furthermore, in order to give the expedition a margin of safety, we would not use one ship alone, but a minimum of three … each rocket ship would be taller than New York’s Empire State Building [almost ¼ mile high] and weigh about ten times the tonnage of the Queen Mary, or some 800,000 tons.”
-Wernher von Braun, the father of the Apollo space program, writing in Conquest of the Moon, 1953</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And the economic climate of 1953.  No nation would put that much money into space travel, and Werner knew how much it would cost to build.  He wasn&#39;t expecting America to spend 5% of its budget on NASA later on.  A very flimsy quote to base anything on.</p>

<p>Edit: the technological advancements of the Werner rocket team were insane.  Several orders of magnitude more power for the same amount of fuel for instance.  People forget how quickly technology advances.  I&#39;m typing to you on an 8-core phone more powerful than most 5 year old desktops.  Technology advances over time, and at a crazy rate when billions are poured into it, and an entire nation is focused on it.</p>

<p>So all during the 50&#39;s, american rockets could barely take off properly, let alone get into the upper atmosphere. In the early 60&#39;s, Russia just about reached space.</p>

<p>Just a few years after that, America suddenly got its act together, built a working rocket and spacecraft, entered space, left the gravitational pull of earth and went through the van allen belts, arrived in the moon&#39;s orbit, dispatched a moon lander, played around for a few days in scorching to freezing temperatures with barely any malfunctions, went back to the rocket in orbit (how the fuck did they manage that one?) and had enough fuel for that million mile + journey back home.</p>

<p>Bullshit.</p>

<li><p>I don&#39;t play the sources game with people. You can lead a horse to water but you cant make them drink. When you play the sources game with people, usually it&#39;s with someone that&#39;s already got their mind made up that &quot;you&#39;re wrong&quot; and &quot;they&#39;re right.&quot; So whatever source you provide, they will find a way to discredit the source, then supply their own, one that counters the source you provided. In most cases, they provide government sources, hilarious I know.</p></li>
<li><p>I don&#39;t keep a database of sources. I looked up everything I know on my own time, read comments and sources of people here over the past 2 and a half years, and just basically connected the dots as I went along.</p></li>
<li><p>I don&#39;t care to &quot;enlighten&quot; or &quot;wake up&quot; people on the internet, only my family and friends. Because on the internet, everyone is a certified badass and it&#39;s hard to get thru to them with text. In real life, you can corner someone with facts and statistics and they can&#39;t hide behind a keyboard. When you&#39;re debating with someone who thinks America is really a sovereign nation and you&#39;re trying to tell them it&#39;s not what it seems, they can never regurgitate a single statistic, just bias and shit they remember from their indoctrination. I only care to inform the people I care about. Because in the end, 99% of the people in this sub already have their minds made up about which &quot;conspiracies&quot; they believe. For example, Flat Earth. My god the hostility when it comes to that theory. It&#39;s a very legitimate one. I don&#39;t buy into it, but the people here get <em>soooo</em> fucking worked up over it, that it&#39;s almost unbearable. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>So, google cold war conspiracy. Do your own research. I&#39;m not gonna guide you into believing what I believe. That&#39;s the problem with this country, everyone believes what they&#39;re told/shown without digging. I&#39;ve spent many many many hours researching, instead of going out partying or playing my xbox. I find this shit fascinating as fuck so it&#39;s not a chore to me. The kicker was 9/11. After like 8 months of research on 9/11 alone, I started to branch out, wondering what the fuck else we&#39;ve been lied to about. So many people say &quot;Not everything is a conspiracy&quot; <strong>- 2 and a half years ago, I would&#39;ve thought someone like me was just a paranoid nutjob, because, the masterpiece is already painted in your mindset regarding conspiracy theorists: that they&#39;re crazy. I digress -</strong> <em>EVERYTHING</em> is a conspiracy. Conspiracies within conspiracies to cover other conspiracies. The world is a game. Everything is an illusion. Nothing is real: boundaries, borders, skin color, religion, sexual preference, national pride. Everything is designed to keep us different and hating each other so they can keep their reign. We outnumber them, they know this. Gotta keep the charade up so they don&#39;t have to go into hiding, or fight us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Holy shit, you remind me so much of someone I know. Just from the way you write/form your sentences/the way you think. I really think it&#39;s possible that you may be him. I&#39;m not even kidding. Are you from Georgia?</p>

<p>It all began researching 9/11 for me as well. It is so BLATANTLY OBVIOUS that there is so much more to that story than we&#39;ve been force-fed the past 14 years that it&#39;s sickening to believe that ANYONE believes the media&#39;s story about it. It&#39;s UNREAL how much of a joke that story is. </p>

<p>That also led me to the conclusion that, hey, we&#39;ve been lied to about this, what else have we been led to believe that is false? So it ended up making me more open minded and it kept me from being a mindless sheep. In a way I&#39;m grateful for that. HOWEVER, that being said, I do NOT believe that &quot;everything is a conspiracy.&quot; I also don&#39;t believe that EVERYTHING is an illusion or nothing is real. I believe that there are a lot of things in this world that are happening or are being enforced to keep the general public in fear in order to keep from having a revolution/uprising and so that they can keep control over us and keep power. Undoubtedly that&#39;s true. </p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t mean that there aren&#39;t things that are genuine in the world. If you let yourself believe that everything is disingenuous, you will eventually drive yourself crazy. Sometimes, believe it or not, blue is just blue. Red is just red. And what you see is actually what you are seeing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not going to argue with you because what you said can&#39;t be proved or disproved and it&#39;s your right to believe that. It could very well be true, but it takes a weak minded individual to actually pay attention to the shit like Justin Bieber and Bruce Jenner. Most mature adults, one would think, would have no concern with the going-ons of celebrities. I sure don&#39;t. I don&#39;t think that stuff is puppeteer-ed to distract people. Celebrities are people, just like you and me. They make mistakes and things happen with them just like you and me. They get in trouble, they do stupid shit. The conspiracy part of it, is that the media chooses to mainly report on ONLY that, to distract the public from the bigger things going on. </p>

<p>All of the celebrity stuff that happens, really happens. It&#39;s not set up. The problem is, is that the media uses shit like Bruce Jenner or Justin Bieber getting arrested to change the attention from a bigger political issue that may be going on or something else. That definitely happens. </p>

<p>As far as religion goes, the hierarchies of it, like the church and the Catholic Church especially are huge scams. But religion is very old and the people choose to believe in whatever god they choose to believe in and subscribe to those beliefs themselves, it&#39;s not forced down their throats. </p>

<p>A lot of things in our world IS an illusion, I agree. Especially the media and the government. It&#39;s fraught with greed and corruption. I completely support a revolution. A big change needs to occur. We need to get rid of the greed and the corruption and elect a true governing body that has our best interests at heart.</p>

<p>I just think when you say things like Justin Bieber getting arrested is puppeteer-ed by some invisible entity, it&#39;s crossing the line from a sound theory to the crazy side a bit. If you rephrase it to say: Justin Bieber getting arrested and the MEDIA choosing to ONLY report this and talk about this all the time to take the publics mind off of the real issues, then you&#39;re getting it right. </p>

<p>The possibility also exists that the question is not necessarily an either/or proposition.  Forcing the discussion into only two choices keeps other possibilities from being discussed.</p>

<p>As much as I believe that we actually went to the Moon, <strong><a href="http://www.evilyoshida.com/thread-5885.html">this discussion about parallax discrepancies</a></strong> in the backgrounds of some of the mission photos makes me curious if there wasn&#39;t something in them that needed <em>correcting</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That also strikes me as odd, however it could be put off as just &quot;we already went&quot; and there&#39;s nothing to be gained from going back as it would cost a lot of tax dollars and NASA&#39;s budget has been exceedingly cut over recent years. I do see where you&#39;re coming from. </p>

<p>Also, one would think that we of course would have the technology to almost nullify the adverse effects of that radiation belt by now. Could the same be said for the technology of that time, however? Very interesting..</p>

<p>You believe the Cold War was a legitimate struggle between two super powers. We&#39;re not even playing the same sport and we&#39;re arguing about the rules, so to speak. So this is a waste of my time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The day Justin Bieber was arrested, and I can&#39;t remember which news outlet, but we&#39;ll say CNN because they suck, was doing a live marijuana discussion. They broke the discussion and never went back to it, to report on Bieber. Idk man. I did say some of it was real, but whenever one of the top dawgs in the celebrity world do something incredibly stupid, there&#39;s a reason behind. And it&#39;s always when something drastic is happening i.e. Jenner/Gay Marriage/Confederate Flag - TPP</p>
