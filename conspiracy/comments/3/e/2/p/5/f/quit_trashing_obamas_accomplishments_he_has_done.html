    <div class="md"><p>Its more then just him. Why does he do things like this? For his own gain? I for one doubt that its better to try to figure out who he is working for. </p>

<p>Also don&#39;t bring the racist angle to this. We don&#39;t need that here or want it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>did you make a list like this for white boy George W? Pretty sure he spent more time vacationing than black man Barack, but yes let&#39;s focus on Obama.</p>

<p>Also I would love to send you a shipment of crustaceans from the Gulf of Mexico. I&#39;ll send enough for your whole family and you all can enjoy them together. Of course man can impact the environment, don&#39;t be absurd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes let&#39;s. You know why? First off Bush isn&#39;t president. He has no power like Obama does. </p>

<p>Your misdirection isn&#39;t unnoticed. While I appreciate your offer I don&#39;t take food from stranger on the net that attack me. Seems kinda un-smart.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He was president 7 years ago and during that time he took more vacation than our black president. But conveniently you focus on the shortcomings of our black president and ignore the shortcomings of his white predecessors, seemingly holding one to a different set of values than another.</p>

<p>Secondly, misdirection would be if I tried to shift the conversation to an unrelated topic. Given your previous statement that human beings can&#39;t alter the environment, I don&#39;t think this fits as I was refuting that specific point. That said of you don&#39;t want me to send you free shrimp from the Gulf of Mexico that&#39;s fine I understand, but to stand behind your point you ought to demonstrate the validity of your comment.</p>

<p>I propose you post a YouTube video of
You taking a family road trip to the Gulf of Mexico and eating a plate of fresh shrimp from the coast, and then head north to Ohio/Pennsylvania and post a second video of you drinking the tap water of some of these places affected by fracking. Specifically the stuff that lights on fire when you hold a flame to it. Then I will have a more full understanding that human actions can&#39;t affect the environment.</p>

<p>Also, Bill Clinton totally inhaled pot. And George W Bush did cocaine, but you only want to focus on the black guy. But I&#39;m sure race has nothing to do with it!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Black president? It isn&#39;t about his skin color. Its about his incompetence as a leader. You need not bring race to this cause I beloved shit would change for the better when he was elected. </p>

<p>Its got worse. Now there is a race war. It won&#39;t get any better. He refuses to even lower the flag for dead marines killed in a recruiting station till 4 days. That&#39;s just respect and should have been done any fucking way. </p>

<p>The climate change I was responding to a question that was asked. </p>

<p>Lastly the dug thing do you have photographic proof they did or hearsay? We have a photo. I don&#39;t feel that someone who is in power should be in office when they didn&#39;t uphold the laws at any time in their life. That&#39;s me. Its a conflict of interests. </p>

<p>How the hell can he support a drug war when he himself has done drugs? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh and about the fracking bullshit I live in pa. Where they are fracking. I don&#39;t have any problems with my water. I have a well too. So your argument is invalid. You believe what you see on TV cause well that&#39;s just easy to believe cause movie pictures makes it real huh?</p>

<p>Sorry but I won&#39;t just take the word of the media when I live there and have no problems. I got a feeling there is another element we were not told of. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find it one the most blatant forms of disrespect. It isn&#39;t legal for one. He is to be held to a higher standard. I don&#39;t care that everyone does it. If you are president you shouldn&#39;t have until that shit is legal thruout all facets. </p>

<p>Shows he doesn&#39;t respect the laws others have been jailed for. Same thing with anyone else. How the fuck can he be a man that stands there and says war on drugs yet did drugs. </p>

<p>Seems deceitful and immoral to me. But yeah sure blah blah weed is good and numerous other amounts of bullshit. I don&#39;t care it still against the law. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off no matter what anyone posts as proof its biased and will be called out as such because either they don&#39;t like the author or cause of the color of the sky. </p>

<p>These are all real facts you as well as many others claim you want sources well look for it. Isn&#39;t that the whole idea behind this sub is to find shit out for yourself and not take the OP word for it?</p>

<p>Now about coal you say its bad for the snails and whales. Yeah know what its also bad for? Entire communities that this is all they know how to do is mine coal. It can be cleaner with modifications to plants but no you want new shiney shit cause its more eye pleasing. Fuck that modify the old shit I say. Its so stupid to just trash it when we have ways to fix the problem</p>

<p>The auto pen thing is a deal of repect. He wants to make a life changing laws he can at least be there to scribble his name on it in person. No he is busy. Doing presidential shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>i have no clue what you&#39;re babbling about. corporations have a social and ethical responsibility</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>I have a suggestion to fix this:  Property rights.</p>

<p>Right now, if a corporation pollutes, the government determines if it&#39;s a &quot;critical&quot; corporation (like oil or textiles) or not.  If it&#39;s critical, they&#39;re allowed to pollute, with a small fine in the media to placate environmentalists like you.  Then you think something is being done and vote democrat or green and then say &quot;I made a difference.&quot;</p>

<p>How about we set it up so if someone pollutes another person&#39;s property, the people who are impacted get their property rights protected and can sue like the wind?  Imagine the results of the BP oil spill after they dropped oil on the whole shoreline of the gulf of Mexico.</p>

<p>Under a property rights system, BP wouldn&#39;t even exist any more, they&#39;d have been sued into oblivion.  Same for a textile company that utterly fucks a whole river.</p>

<p>Under a big central management government system, they&#39;re protected... cuz they&#39;re so &quot;important.&quot;</p>

<p>I guess the downside of the property rights method is there&#39;s not much opportunity for graft and selling of favors.</p>

<p>Maybe you should be less to throw accusations and a bit more to pose a problem and I will counter with my theory. That&#39;s the problem in here is that you want to be a asshole because that makes you feel you have the high ground.</p>

<p>This subreddit is about ideas and thinking about things. We all have different views. Like some believe we have lizard people others say flat earth. Many call them names because a label makes you feel more secure in your position cause now they are categorized. Really all that is to me is that you are weak and can&#39;t accept alternate ideas cause your construct of the world is so limited that if those were possible your mind would fracture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You probably ought to look up the definition of conspiracy or just check the sidebar. It&#39;s annoying to come to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and see people blaming Obama when they know damn well the entire system is corrupt, that or they are just ignorant to the facts. Our elected representatives will continue to be self-serving scum until the people stand up and demand change. Lobbyists and donors write policy and form opinions in this country, ignorant people follow the script. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are singling out an individual in the sea of the self-serving, but then again I&#39;m singling out your post in a sea of Obama bashing posts that continue to litter the internet. </p>

<p>I understand he isn&#39;t a good President but we haven&#39;t had a good one in a very long time. </p>

<p>Look beyond the individual; educate yourself and others on the reasons we have shitty people in office. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Destroy the planet? Ha I bet you think that something as insignificant as man can impact this planet in a way that it won&#39;t heal from.</p>

<p>You do realize this planet was here long before we as a species were and will be here long after we leave.</p>

<p>For you to think that corporations are destroying this planet tells me you watch whale wars and don&#39;t stop to think about the amount of oil and diesel fuel that ship they use to save the oceans dumps back into the damn thing. </p>

<p>Blame humanities greed not the ones supplying that greed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. People keep saying we want sources. Lol I say find them yourself. I won&#39;t make it any easier on you to accept it. Either you will or won&#39;t </p>

<p>I don&#39;t see why its my responsibility to convince you of these things when they are all true. If you don&#39;t believe me then just move along and hate someone for showing it too you.</p>
