        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Think about it.. </p>

<p>All of the early rap (Chuck D, Tupac, BDP, many more) were very political. They did not aquisse to establishement norms, money and excess. Rather, they desired to fight the system. Nowadays, no rappers speak about anything political, instead, the content is almost &#39;shill&#39; like, completing conforming to societal norms and worshipping money and excess (Drake, French Montana, YG, etc). Rappers are often leaders and icons within the black community, why aren&#39;t they representing the community via political stance and expression like they did not too long ago...?</p>

<p>In fact, one might argue that today there is more of a need for political messages within art, and counter culture references against institutional racism than ever before... Yet references and activist communication is glaringly absent from the picture. How convenient for those in power trying to reinforce the status quote.</p>

<p>Prediction: We don&#39;t see much activist ideology in this dialogue either. Rather, the top submission point will be opposed, or working to sweep the issue aside. Further, my response to that post will be downvoted.  Why?  This is not something users are interested in; instead, they desire the material. By design? No way to really tell; however, a populace instilled with virulent consumerism is easier to control than a free thinking activist populace.</p>

<p>*There are now 77 posts on this submission... Hey look!  The first placed text about the topic is dismissing it... Saying that it&#39;s not a big deal, it&#39;s an issue with all music.  Fascinating :D</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good point.  Though I don&#39;t know if profit is simply the basic economic result of users being interested in buying the music, therefore the artists profit.  </p>

<p>Rather, there may be some layers of filtration, whereby socially charged, political messages are dismantled and diminished, regardless of interest in the profit/public sphere.  Or at least it seems that way, considering the extreme change of direction rap has taken.</p>

<p>With todays current socioeconomic situation, as well as the institutional racism we see in criminal enforcement, to have no members of the rap community speaking about this is deplorable.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do notice a change, but there may be other factors in play. I&#39;m not going to downplay the conspiracy theory part of it, but there may be other things. The age demographics may have changed, things like music streaming and the death of CDs may have changed how you have to target the music in order to maximize profit. </p>

<p>There may be a political reason, but there may be some underlying economic changes here as well. Maybe they discovered marketing towards a younger crowd (political statements probably wouldn&#39;t resonate too well with them?) would be a better profit in a new market. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree... Often change is a constellation of various elements.  However, generally... When speaking of quick, aggressive change (which we are in the case of the rap industry&#39;s alteration of primary message) that generally is provoked from a singular source.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s definitely possible, but there&#39;s so many moving parts. Let&#39;s remember that the entire music model basically changed in that short time frame as well due to the rapid technological change of apple products/streaming/ etc. I&#39;m guessing consumer tastes changed rapidly, a couple of the newer &quot;Party yolo&quot; types may have hit big with a changing demographic and more recent rappers copied in hopes of having similar success.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think &#39;streaming&#39; effected the rap industry indubitably.  However, wouldn&#39;t it stand to reason that it&#39;s effect would be primarily economic and not content oriented?  Though they are related, they are not related enough to explain the marked shift we see in mainstream rap content, in my opinion.</p>

<p>It would even stand to reason that streaming made the industry less controllable.  Which, would then do the opposite of what we observe currently.  We are are seeing a centralization of the industry message, as opposed to a fracturing of the rap community into many different uncontrollable subsets...  </p>

<p>Despite the fact that streaming could be debated to lessen institutional control on the music industry, I think we can see demonstrable effects that would point to the opposite...  Was rap purchased by elite interest to maintain status quote?  Are mainstream rap artists watering down their message, veering away from politically active ideology?  Seems likely. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think kids nowadays are getting into music at an earlier age just because of its ubiquity and ease of getting said music, as opposed to when you had to buy CDs. Couple this with the media infatuation with glitz and glam starlets that kids/teens are so into these days, and I see a natural reason that the rappers themselves would say &quot;hey look what the kids are really into, we should emulate this&quot;. </p>

<p>The media could certainly be pushing this shift, but it&#39;s always possible that the rap game itself is just responding to changing ideologies from the population. But, the fact that I know the radio game itself is HEAVILY played means that there&#39;s always a good chance of some kind of next level games being played. I just think it&#39;s good to look at every side of the story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll never doubt that, if the people don&#39;t care about dissenting the government, I find it logical that the record labels wouldn&#39;t push that content. </p>

<p>But that&#39;s always going to be the question in a situation like this, are the rappers responding to an apparent lack of interest in that kind of content from the population?

    <div class="md"><p>Good question.</p>

<p>While I went through this internally, in a thought experiment, I reached the same question.  </p>

<p>This clear shift in content is favorable to those in power, those interested in enforcing the status quote.   Further, this change in content has been done very quickly.  A manifestation such as this occurring organically in the timespan is a low probability.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have slight pause to come to that same conclusion just for the reason that technology exploded in such a short time frame during the same time period. </p>

<p>Twitter, Facebook, myspace, TMZ, instagram, pandora, apple, itunes, etc, all came to the forefront at the same time. I staunchly believe that social media has made us dumber, more narcissistic, and dangerously, more apathetic towards serious issues. We get bombarded with information about our friends, celebrities, artists, that it can feel almost like that&#39;s what &quot;seems&quot; important to everyone because they see it so often on the net. </p>

<p>Even though we can now look into conspiracies and government wrongdoing deeper than ever before, people care less than ever before. And I really think it&#39;s because of things like social media. Almost paradoxically, giving people an open arena would seemingly allow for even more dissenting ideas to hit the forefront, but it seems like open arenas devolve into the lowest common denominator. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m rambling now, but I think alot of it has to do with the fact that artists and record labels can see more of what listeners are into and what they share amongst each other than ever before. And, it seems that most people just like to talk about stupid crap like celebs and cat pictures and glitz, and labels could be tapping into that. </p>

<p>In a world where we can hear more and more about political wrongdoings, the population seems more and more like it just wants to close its ears and shelter itself. </p>

<p>Sorry for that rambling. I was almost just trying to get my thoughts together there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love this interaction... You are wise and intelligent.  But please, in any preceding posts, work to extrapolate and provide a better synopsis of your idea... This boarders on TL;DR... </p>

<p>However, I did read.  Neat theory.  It is plausible that streaming and the technology era changed demographics and the zeitgeist so quickly and so drastically as to reduce humanity to the &#39;lowest common denominator&#39; as you say.  </p>

<p>But my counter to that would be... In the not too distant past, the leaders of the black community whom became famous (some of them rappers) were leaders who spoke for the community&#39;s plight, for their suffering.  This is not so anymore.  I don&#39;t believe the change in technology is enough for this to be the case, as it represents human viewpoints.  But it is possible.

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely was TL;DR. I was rambling for sure, it&#39;s not an issue I think about often so I was trying to get the writing on the wall so to speak.</p>

<p>I definitely agree that there&#39;s been a shift so to speak on how issues are fought for. It&#39;s possible that today&#39;s younger black generation is far enough removed that they no longer really care about their plight as much as their forefathers once did. </p>

<p>I thought about something, and maybe you can shed light on it. It might even contradict myself. Tupac was considered one of the largest &quot;dissenter&quot; rappers, but his most famous song (arguably anyway) is California Love, which is almost a precursor to the kind of music today. Is it possible that aspiring rappers looked at California Love and said to themselves &quot;Wow, tupac&#39;s biggest song wasn&#39;t deep, but shallow party music...maybe he was on to something&quot;. </p>

<p>Maybe one of Tupac&#39;s song&#39;s is responsible for the entire pop rap industry today being pro establishment.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is very true, yet it wasn&#39;t always the case.  At least not to this extent.  I&#39;m wondering why that shift in consciousness occurred?  Was it natural, as you say, just a result of economics and selling out.  Or, was there some hidden work at play, allowing the rap industry to change so quickly, and so favorably for established power interests.</p>

<p>Because, let&#39;s be honest.  In raps early years, and on through its continued development, it was the most anti establishment music out there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was definitely a control mechanism behind it, you see it in the 90&#39;s and after the West/East coast feud. It was getting deep and political, so you had faggots like Sisco and others. Made it more about partying and happy go lucky (materialism/partying). Not saying it wasn&#39;t there before, but after tupac and biggie died, shit started to change. Look at puff daddy and master P, lulz. I think it was done on purpose and once these two influence figures were gone, they changed the game and the rest sold out. If you didn&#39;t you went indie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the main point of the song is. He had gotten to a level where many people were listening. Looking at the world through the rear view, means that you are always worried someone is coming from behind to attack you. He knew he was being targeted and lived a life of justified paranoia, of someone being after him, hence &quot;staring at the world through the rear view&quot;. Which is why I mentioned it. You can say all you want, once you get the attention of others, you better be looking at life through the rear view. That is my point.</p>

<p>I think that the music can be good because it&#39;s catchy, but I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve heard anything incredible that comes from mainstream. Can you show me some?</p>

<p>Ya know, that song is pretty intense. I don&#39;t know how to describe it, but it felt like a pattern of relaxing sounds followed by adrenaline/anxiety sounds. I don&#39;t know if that makes sense lol. Pretty good though. </p>

<p>Does the message matter to you? It may just be easier to have others relate to them by conveying a message that is more common and simple to rap about. </p>

<p>I still feel it&#39;s because they are controlled now and because there are few left that aren&#39;t threatened or scared or are willing to pass up the money and fame. Tupac, Biggie, and DMX might have been served as warnings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do agree to disagree. But, that is not the point of what I&#39;m saying. There is a bigger agenda, and I&#39;m simply asking you to observe it. It&#39;s not just rap. All music has changed, because <em>they</em> want a specific agenda to be displayed/propagandized to the public. I agree with everything that you have said, I&#39;m just saying it&#39;s bigger than just &quot;rap&quot;. I&#39;ll move on though, nice discussing this issue with you and cheers!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>*First of all, in one of the previous discussions, we had a great back and forth about art and it&#39;s affect on people en masse.  It was powerful and profound.  We should congratulate both of ourselves (patting myself on back :D  )</p>

<p>...continuing forward with this new line of thinking...</p>

<p>Fair enough... All music has changed.  But you must admit, there is a spectrum in influential music on the masses.  Mozart is not going to affect the populace as much as rage against the machine.  :) </p>

<p>After accepting this, we can look at rap specifically.  Rap, as opposed to most other music (country, rock, jazz, classical) has been stubbornly anti establishment (that is until recently, hence the point of my submission.)  </p>

<p>Therefore, It should be noted that the most anti establishment music, is now pro establishment. Disguised under sophisticated and artistic beats and lyrics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rap is not the only anti-establishment music. Punk, rock and hell even Folk have always been. Look at the 60&#39;s music and now. It&#39;s a concerted effort to stomp out all anti-establishment music. Listen to some Bob Marley, some Bob Dylan, some Sex Pistols, some Nirvana. It&#39;s all catchy and retarded these days. Rock is about being drunk and owning a mansion, Country is about being poor but loving the Country (no matter what). Well, WTF is this country? Rap is about popping bottles and fucking hoes. Pop music is all about being you, drink, be gay, be a tranny, YOLO. It&#39;s a mass agenda, realize this. EDM is catchy, why do you think rap is mostly EDM? It&#39;s a electro beat. What is EDM, and listen to it while you research that culture. Dig deeper, is all I&quot;m saying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rap, like all is a fad. Everything is a fad until something <strong>better</strong> comes along. Sometimes it&#39;s unknown, sometimes it&#39;s suppressed. Think about that. Do people still listen to britanny Spears or Nikki Minaj? They are fed this, this is what they will listen to, this is cool. I suggest reading Edward Bernays, not trying to be critical, or anything, but, you seem to not know  TPTB&#39;s tactics. Are you new to conspiracy theory, if so, cool, I can give you some good resources. Lemme know. If you aren&#39;t, my bad, just seems curious.</p>

<p>Today, Drakes videos telling users you only live once (so do whatever you can to live in the moment, hedonistic materialism)  They have over 10 million views, and they are not alone...

<p>Almost every band I listen to has a very very anti system message in a lot of their songs, Disturbed, Lamb of God, Metallica (used to anyway), Trivium, Five Finger Death Punch, Megadeth, etc etc...</p>

<p>Rock/Metal is so demonized by TPTB/MSM that it is no surprise that these bands generally go unnoticed by a lot of people, but it&#39;s certainly there, and very very powerful/popular for never being &quot;promoted&quot; like the other genres of music.</p>

<p>Do you think that is split evenly amongst the ever growing public?</p>

<p>So be clear....  You are saying that the reason we are hearing about members of the black community being shot today is because we (who is we?) are using the same outlets rappers are using to spread the word about violence perpetrated on the black community?  (confused) </p>

<p>Calling bullshit on that...  But you are correct, Moore&#39;s law is obviously having an effect.  A lot has changed in the world in 15 years.  However, I am commenting on one particular change, which was drastic.  So drastic that it would be hard to occur naturally during that time span...</p>

<p>The drastic change was for the world&#39;s foremost political and anti establishment music to be co opted and transformed into music that reinforces the current societal norm.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason why rap has strayed so far from what it was is because the rich bastards realized that it was the perfect vessel to get the message across to the masses.  It&#39;s roots were real and genuine.  The early rappers were pissed the hell off.  People could tell, and more importantly, people listened.  So the powerful elite highjacked the system.  They started injecting ungodly amounts of money into it to change everyone&#39;s views, to change the message that was being sent.  Their plan worked flawlessly.  Now the masses are so far gone it&#39;s pathetic.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice!</p>

<p>However, the point of this submission is to highlight the aggressive change of course we have seen from mainstream rap in a small historical period.  </p>

<p>In  my humble opinion, the movement has changed to favor vested power interests, which is either convenient for them, or speaks to inorganic effects intentionally implemented to alter the rap industry.  Which would be fucking terrifying.</p>

It&#39;s a concerted effort to stomp out all anti-establishment music. Listen to some Bob Marley, some Bob Dylan, some Sex Pistols, some Nirvana. It&#39;s all catchy and retarded these days. Rock is about being drunk and owning a mansion, Country is about being poor but loving the Country (no matter what). Well, WTF is this country? Rap is about popping bottles and fucking hoes. Pop music is all about being you, drink, be gay, be a tranny, YOLO. It&#39;s a mass agenda, realize this. EDM is catchy, why do you think rap is mostly EDM? It&#39;s a electro beat. What is EDM, and listen to it while you research that culture. Dig deeper, is all I&quot;m saying.</p>
