<p>This was due to Chinese scientists pursuing a theory. We will be forced to keep up with China since they seem more keen on developing tech than we are. India is becoming a big player in my field and they make their research available.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you make of Phil Schneider? At first glance, everything he says seems crazy, but if you think about it, it&#39;s likely that an alien civilization exists somewhere in the universe. If that civilization does exist, think of how advanced their tech would be. We have only been flying airplanes for a century, and had computers for a little over half. Imagine what we would have in 5,000 years. It&#39;s almost guaranteed that we would be able to visit other galaxies with super advanced tech. Now, if you stumbled upon a civilization on another planet like our civilization was 50 years ago, and crashed a spaceship, they would be able to reverse engineer some of our technology and get a massive boost in their productivity. I think that is what happened to us, and everything Phil Schneider said starts to make more sense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The skeptics point out that it takes forever to traverse space even if travelling almost the speed of light. This leaves two alternatives, one is to travel a very long time to reach another star, the other is to find a breakthrough in physics allowing travel over great distances.</p>

<p>If aliens found such a breakthrough in physics that we humans do not possess, sure they could be and probably are everywhere. </p>

<p>The part I&#39;m most skeptical of is an &#39;alien crash.&#39; How in the hell does a super advanced species crash into a planet? Highly unlikely imo.</p>

<p>Perhaps they anticipated a friendly planet and were shot out of the sky. Perhaps they were traveling deep into space and had technical issues, then found this planet to be the only possible place to land and diverted their course here. Perhaps the civilization always existed here underground, and they were just testing out new toys or performing some covert operations to adjust the course of human politics. </p>

<p>If we want to get silly, there&#39;s a few more possibilities. Maybe the Roswell incident was a Japanese or Soviet ship that they built using technological secrets they received from aliens. They would obviously need to trade something in return, so maybe the aliens like the taste of human or they take specimens from this planet and use them as breeders for a slave population on their planet. Or they simply want to prep this planet as much as possible so they can migrate here. They just give us technology to speed that along and Roswell was just a US test flight gone bad. Maybe they need gold and this is where all the gold is disappearing to. This is all right off the top of my head. I don&#39;t think we should dismiss something just because we&#39;ve failed to imagine how a small aspect of it could be possible. </p>

<p>It was <em>Nazi</em>. Read &quot;Roswell and the Reich&quot; by Joseph P. Farrell.</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t alien either, that was a red herring.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s <em>possible</em> the crash was an accident, but I lean towards the theory that it was <em>deliberately</em> crashed as a psy-op on the American people (<em>and</em> government).</p>

<p>I think it was a message, a &quot;look what we can do&quot; so to speak.</p>

<p>Have you read the complete Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy?</p>

<p>They crash a clunky ship on purpose onto a planet to &quot;wake it up&quot;.</p>

<p>If I recall correctly, it was a planet that couldn&#39;t see any stars so they didn&#39;t know anything but themselves. They reversed engineered the clunky spaceship, discovered the rest of the universe, and decided it needed to go, so they started the bloodiest war in the history of the galaxy.</p>

<p>So basically something we might do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you serious? Look at what corporations, governments are responsible for on this planet. Massive pollution causing global warming, fracking poisoning people&#39;s drinking water, the oceans acidification happening at an unprecedented rate, fisheries dredging the bottoms of oceans destroying the micro environments that exist there, creating &quot;dead zones&quot; where no sea life exists, corruption, destruction of the middle class, genocide, hitler was just roughly 75 years ago......</p>

<p>The list goes on and on and considering all of scientific forecasting is predicting the coming of advanced genetically modified humans via crispr/cas9 tech and transhumanists, then its only a matter of the next 50-100 years, or possibly 2 generations before we start seeing the development of some sort of Human 2.0.</p>

<p>I actually believe a theory that we won&#39;t be able to access intergalactic light speed travel (possibly via worm hole tech, i.e. the stretching of time/space), until there is a big population of humans 2.0.</p>

<p>Furthermore, a second earth may have a slightly different atmospheric composition from earth, requiring the inhabitants be genetically modified to be able to breath there, leaving the old versions limited to indoors or Oxygen masks.</p>

<p>Bottom line: human 1.0 psychology has fucked, and continues to fuck, this planet, only considering solutions once the damage has been done</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just because humans are capable of that, doesn&#39;t mean they are, is the first point, which is clearly self evident in the news each night. And the second is that even if you select a crew of people to go colonize another planet which hold a high percentage of those beneficial variables, its the children from these people that&#39;s the X factor, because even with a systematically positive nurturing environment, there is no guarantee these individuals will carry or manifest a high percentage of positive attributes. This is the case in various well to do families which have the black sheep child which ends up a complete failure, addict, felon, or worse scenarios like rapist, killer, peado because those in the latter group are/were someones children.</p>

<p>With modified humans 2.0, i&#39;m willing to bet over a study of their lifetimes, there would much lower instances of negative acts/attributes, or possibly even zero cases of felonies/murders etc, proving this group to have better statistical odds in a colonization scenario</p>

With the release of certain technologies, I&#39;d say that if he was right, humans would spread into space like thistledown.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you head over to r/emdrive you can learn more about the supposedly new breakthrough propulsion technology that is taking reddit by storm. I however, believe our government has already been at this for quite some time. Listen to what skunk works head Ben Rich said before he died.   &quot;We already have the means to travel among the stars, but these technologies are locked up in black projects and it would take an Act of God to ever get them out to benefit humanity.&quot; Now look back into the black budget world of aerospace engineering you will find that the same concepts keep popping up. Shortly after World War II all the aerospace community was clamoring about counterbary and egrav propulsion then it just stopped instantly. At the same exact time reports of exotic disc shaped craft explode in magnitude. T. Townsend Brown, project Winterhaven, project Montgolfier, project silverbug, the Nazi Bell, Magnetohydrodynamics, superfluidity, superconductors, microwave based propulsion, Bose Einstein condensate in a lattice structure rotating...it all feeds into a puzzle that we don&#39;t have all the pieces to because it is all highly classified, but if you ignore the quack science ion lifters and home brew inventors and look for historical evidence you will see a pattern of the United States government having technology far beyond what was previously thought to have existed. Here is another link referring to Janes Defense Weekly and what Boeing and BAE systems have supposedly been up to with Phantom works G.R.A.S.P.

    <div class="md"><p>Just because humans are capable of that, doesn&#39;t mean they are, is the first point, which is clearly self evident in the news each night. And the second is that even if you select a crew of people to go colonize another planet which hold a high percentage of those beneficial variables, its the children from these people that&#39;s the X factor, because even with a systematically positive nurturing environment, there is no guarantee these individuals will carry or manifest a high percentage of positive attributes. This is the case in various well to do families which have the black sheep child which ends up a complete failure, addict, felon, or worse scenarios like rapist, killer, peado because those in the latter group are/were someones children.</p>

<p>With modified humans 2.0, i&#39;m willing to bet over a study of their lifetimes, there would much lower instances of negative acts/attributes, or possibly even zero cases of felonies/murders etc, proving this group to have better statistical odds in a colonization scenario</p>
