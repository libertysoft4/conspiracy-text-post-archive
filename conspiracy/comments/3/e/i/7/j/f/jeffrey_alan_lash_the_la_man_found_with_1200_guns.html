July 22 at 4:46pm ·</p>

<p>UPDATE: Craig Harvey in the coroner’s office called the Palisades News at 3:20 today to say the body discovered in a car on Palisades Drive the previous Friday had still not been identified.</p>

<p>“We were unable to get fingerprints,” Harvey said, noting that they would now have to try to determine his identity through dental records or perhaps X-rays. They have a possible name, but are unable to confirm it without positive identification.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Unfortunately I can&#39;t post the link to Palisades News because this release is from yesterday and is available on Palisades News facebook page, which seems to be prohibited here.</p>

<p>But &quot;unable to get fingerprints&quot;???</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a pretty interesting conversation ongoing about this story at Websleuths.com. Lots of useful links.</p>

<p>They also seem to have uncovered some real estate deals that can&#39;t be traced, relating to the &#39;fiance&#39; Catherine Nebron, who left him dead in his car.</p>

<p>There was also mention that the cars he drove had no license plates. No source for that except from employees of a local restaurant where he went to eat raw filet mignon every day and always paid in cash.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lash’s father’s domestic partner, 93-year-old Shirley Anderson, told KTLA that she and her partner never knew where Lash lived or had any way to get in touch with him. When Lash’s father was dying, Anderson said she was unable to contact Lash, who never came to the funeral.... Anderson said she was unaware of any independent wealth that would allow Lash to purchase millions of dollars in weaponry.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Photos from the scene of the police search show dozens and dozens of boxes of ammunition, a cash counter with thousands of dollars stacked nearby, and many piles of rifles and specialized firearms. Then, in Nebron’s home, they found a weapons cache she had described: more than 1,200 firearms and about 6 1/2 tons of ammunition....The guns were worth $5 million, Braun said. Some $230,000 in cash was also found in the home, according to the attorney. </p>

<p>Several storage units remained to be searched, Braun said. He had heard that there were at least four heavily modified Toyota SUVs ready for combat and able to operate in various types of terrain.</p>
