        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So for the second time in as many months, we&#39;ve had a guy with mental problems who got all riled up on the internet with racist paranoid conspiracy theories who then walks into a public place and murders innocent people. Dylann Roof last month and then just yesterday, John Houser. </p>

<p>Both of these people fed themselves a steady diet of online racism and paranoid conspiracy theory. Both of them felt so motivated by what they were feeding themselves that they had to murder people. </p>

<p>So here we are, the next day. R/Conspiracy is one of the most prolific sources of conspiracy theory, and the white supremacy element here has been discussed many times in the past ( <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Mp3eXsC.jpg">remember this?</a> ). So here we are, with the same people pumping out conspiracy theory after conspiracy theory and racist invective after racist invective, churning out poison nuggets like an assembly line, the same stuff that fed the brains of the last two people to walk into a public place and shoot people dead because of things they read on the internet.</p>

<p>And you, you personally, you still come every day to this poison factory and support it with your pageviews and posts.</p>

<p>Is it still worth it? Even though the cost can now be measured in human lives? </p>

<p>It&#39;s a yes or no question. Let&#39;s see how many of you have the courage to honestly answer. </p>

<p>I am aware that my account will probably be banned from this subreddit for asking this simple and honest question. And I am also aware that many of the responses here will be that this didn&#39;t happen, it&#39;s a false flag, it&#39;s all a lie. Those responses are dodges, and they don&#39;t answer the question.</p>

<p>But surely there are some of you that have the courage and honesty to just answer this question for me.</p>

<p>Is it still worth it?</p>

<p>Is it still worth it? Even though the cost can now be measured in human lives?</p>

<p>Why don&#39;t you ask this question to the financial elite? Those who push for drug approval, knowing there are lethal side effects. Those who commit acts of terrorism in the name of gaining more wealth and power. These people kill 1000000X more than any lone shooter ever could. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look dude, kids (military drone &quot;pilots&quot;) with joysticks vaporize a group of 20 people at a wedding on America&#39;s orders, and they all hi-five and get medals and hugs from mom. Was <em>that</em> worth it? This guy at the theater should&#39;ve been in a mental institution. But wasn&#39;t, because they phased-out the majority of asylums in the 60-70s - thinking big pharma could handle it.</p>

<p>By the way, this guy was living in a motel (far from his home) with disguises, wigs and shit. Plus, he may have had psychologist handlers since his former wife tried to have him committed at one point. It&#39;s a very safe bet he was on psych meds like 99% of these cases. Also, MK is a reality. Hypnosis is a reality. This fits that type of scenario. Go to theater. Pull trigger. Put gun to head. Oh, look.. random incriminating tweets and fake online profiles. Don&#39;t get hoodwinked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it is. I think your post stated it best &quot;we&#39;ve had a guy with mental problems..&quot; So are you insinuating that all of the conspiracy community have mental problems and are racists or that all people with mental problems are conspiracy theorists as well as racists?  I&#39;m not sure why you felt the need to stop by &amp; spew your own particular brand of poison, but I do wish you would take it somewhere else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I&#39;m not really sure since I&#39;ve never looked into it before.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m guessing it would probably involve some certified psychology cats coming over and looking for any glaring issues and/or informing us as to how, when, and why some nut-job might &quot;take things too far&quot; as you put it.  </p>

<p>Also, giving us tools to deal with said nut-job on site.  I mean these psychos don&#39;t live in a void.  Environmental influences could actually produce stronger/weaker results.  We should look into that IMO</p>

<p>Edit: I bet we could vet some knowledgeable, trained, and certified people from a psych sub... We could have open debates about what each candidate could bring to the table.  There are probably some individuals who would be willing to donate their time to this pursuit. </p>

<p>Collective punishment and demonization of a group for the actions of an INDIVIDUAL dodges the issue.</p>
