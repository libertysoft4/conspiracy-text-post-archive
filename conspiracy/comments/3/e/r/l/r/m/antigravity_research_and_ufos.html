        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve been piecing this together for a while now, improving and expanding on what I can when I come by new information. Let me know what you think, and any criticism is welcome. </p>

<p>The notion of aliens crashing on Earth is probably insulting to any interstellar civilization.</p>

<p>When it comes to the subject of crashing UFO&#39;s and UFO&#39;s in general it&#39;s best to leave aliens out of it and look at what we humans are capable of.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve probably looked into what the US was researching: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_gravity_control_propulsion_research">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_gravity_control_propulsion_research</a></p>

<p>Many people within the US government clearly had a lot of interest in anti-gravity or field propulsion throughout the 50&#39;s, but it seems at some point the decision was made to publicly discontinue and discredit all research of this type.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re familiar with project blue book the US government was also clearly obfuscating the subject of UFO&#39;s with contrived explanations like light refracting through swamp gas which were regarded by the public as a joke.</p>

<p>You won&#39;t find Tesla&#39;s name anywhere in that wiki but he may have been one of the earliest pioneers of field propulsion if any of this is to be believed: <a href="http://www.henrymakow.com/teslas_flying_machine.html">http://www.henrymakow.com/teslas_flying_machine.html</a></p>

<p>Although the source and some of its assertions are somewhat dubious it would appear the quotes from Tesla which were published in newspapers are accurate.</p>

<p>So Tesla was definitely working on a flying machine and a dynamic theory of gravity (unified field theory) in some capacity.</p>

<p>According to the theory put forward here Tesla&#39;s ideas were noticed by the Nazis and other parties and developed in secret.</p>

<p>To me the development of these Tesla flying machines sounds like a much more plausible source for the UFO phenomena around that time than aliens and it would explain why so many of them were crashing.</p>

<p>Tesla is easily ridiculed for his ideas concerning physics because of their unorthodox nature and his odd phrasing. He was in direct competition with Einstein and rejected the concept of space-time in favor of aether theory which was fallaciously thought to be disproved at the time even though aether theories and spacetime theories are very compatible from the right perspective.</p>

<p>Interestingly a lot of cutting edge theories regarding zero point energy seem to back up many of Tesla&#39;s ideas concerning aether and gravity: <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/technology/warp/ipspaper.html">http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/technology/warp/ipspaper.html</a></p>

<p>In that paper inertia is described as nothing but an electromagnetic illusion and gravity is described as nothing other than an electromagnetic side-effect and it talks about exploiting this revelation for a new revolution in propulsion.</p>

<p>The revolution may have already happened in the mid 1900&#39;s but was kept secret out of fear of the proliferation of this technology turning into something that governments couldn&#39;t control, groups of people and nations leaving the jurisdiction and reach of any earthly government and military with ease, leading to chaos in space that could have devastating consequences for the earth and humanity.</p>

<p>What I think is the smoking gun here is the reemergence of old concepts researched by the government like electrogravitics that were supposedly abandoned because they didn&#39;t work out. It&#39;s possible that we&#39;re slowly being brought back up to speed now that some next gen security infrastructure has been developed, or maybe the complex is just desperate for some fresh eyes on old problems.</p>

<p>According to this ESA experiment gravity manipulation is worth investigating because the forces observed are orders of magnitude greater than previously predicted: <a href="http://gsp.esa.int/article-view/-/wcl/Fd1ZihgaGrwB/10192/towards-a-new-test-of-general-relativity-">http://gsp.esa.int/article-view/-/wcl/Fd1ZihgaGrwB/10192/towards-a-new-test-of-general-relativity-</a></p>

<p>This experiment is reminiscent of Eugene Podkletnov&#39;s experiments with a rotating superconducting disc in the 90s, his claims weren&#39;t taken seriously though: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Podkletnov">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Podkletnov</a></p>

<p>But Eugene was working off of someone else&#39;s theory.</p>

<p>The original source of claims of antigravity effects from a rotating superconducting disc came from Ning Li, who left her position at the University of Alabama to pursue a DOD contract researching antigravity at her still operating company:  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ning_Li_%28physicist%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ning_Li_%28physicist%29</a></p>

<p>Supposing that we could control gravity what would be the ultimate evolution of this technology? Warp drive.</p>

<p>In 1994 Miguel Alcubierre released his paper detailing how faster than light travel would be possible by warping space and riding gravity waves.</p>

<p>Pop science obfuscates this concept by insisting that it would take impossible exotic matter and negative energy to fuel such a warp drive but this is nonsense.</p>

<p>Because of the astronomical amounts of energy he calculated would be necessary to power his warp drive it was considered unfeasible and wasn&#39;t given attention until 2012.</p>

<p>Originally Alcubierre&#39;s warp drive was powered by a flat ring of &quot;exotic matter&quot; (they fail to mention that the exotic matter could be nothing more than a rotating superconducting disc), but in 2012 Harold White rearranged this flat ring into a toroid (donut) and it made the warp drive so much more efficient that the forces necessary are actually realizable: <a href="http://news.discovery.com/space/history-of-space/warp-drive-possible-nasa-tests-100yss-120917.htm">http://news.discovery.com/space/history-of-space/warp-drive-possible-nasa-tests-100yss-120917.htm</a></p>

<p>The curious thing to me is that this rearrangement took so long.</p>

<p>This is because the toroid configuration has been associated with gravity manipulation for a long time as you can tell from this 1960&#39;s paper grounded in general relativity titled Guidelines To Antigravity by Robert L. Forward: <a href="http://u2.lege.net/culture.zapto.org_82_20080124/antigravidity/Robert%20L.Forward%20-%20Guidelines%20to%20Antigravity.pdf">http://u2.lege.net/culture.zapto.org_82_20080124/antigravidity/Robert%20L.Forward%20-%20Guidelines%20to%20Antigravity.pdf</a></p>

<p>I know it&#39;s easy to blame this on incompetence but I find that far too convenient because of how sought after this technology should be.</p>

<p>As Harold White says &quot;Recall that December of 1942 saw the first demonstration of a controlled nuclear reaction that generated a whopping half watt. This existence proof was followed by the activation of a ~four megawatt reactor in November 1943. Existence proof for the practical application of a scientific idea can be a tipping point for technology development.&quot;</p>

<p>Although it would appear existence proof of these concepts was around long before Harold White but never took off publicly.</p>

<p>This is probably because they were developed in secret and hid from the public.</p>

<p>What I think will either tie this theory together or destroy it are the results of a White–Juday warp-field interferometer experiment.</p>

<p>In their experiment all they&#39;re using to warp space-time is a high voltage toroid capacitor meaning they must find some plausibility in electrogravitics, and capacitors are what is used in Brown&#39;s gravitators and likely what we would have found Tesla was using if he ever had the chance the release his flying machine work.</p>

<p>Anti-gravity is something which is definitely possible in theory, but again, we are light years away from the technology required to achieve it.</p>

<p>Yes, I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s impossible, just implausible. The distances involved in interstellar travel are larger than the human brain can even imagine. Seems a hell of a long way to go for a civilisation which is less than primitive in comparison.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a fair comparison. Firstly you&#39;d have to find out they were there, secondly, the distances involved in interstellar travel as compared to popping along to see your neighbouring planet are so different I could not even begin to explain them, and thirdly, you are assuming that, because humans are curious, all creatures are curious.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to shit on your parade. I do see your point, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a fair analogy.</p>

<p>I agree with this. I believe this precise point has been made by another poster, and I agreed with it then, too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thus if aliens found out we existed and had the technology they would come visit us. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. This is false logic. You&#39;re saying humans are curious therefore aliens must be curious. The very word, &quot;alien&quot;, suggests that they might be quite different from us.</p>

<p>And, as I also pointed out to the previous poster, there are logistical problems which, with all due respect, I do not think you understand the depth of. The human brain is the most powerful computer we know about and even it cannot even begin to fathom the distances involved in interstellar travel. For example, if a ship left Earth travelling at the top speed we have so far achieved, it would take something like 28 million years to reach Kepler 22- B. </p>

<p>On top of that, when you look out into space you are looking out into the past. And when we are talking about the distances involved in interstellar space, a long, long way into the past. Hence, in order for an alien civilisation to see us as we are here, at this moment, then they would have to be looking at us from the distant future. In other words, it is still going to take a long time for them to get here.</p>

<p>I&#39;m assuming out of the set of alien creatures, the curious ones would be most likely to technologically innovate to the point where they could develop interstellar space travel. Out of that subset, some would be curious about other life. Those are the aliens we are talking about. The ones that spend their lives digging in their navel are not our concern.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The human brain evolved to handle social situations and is not well equipped to understand the majority of the things we use it to do day to day. You shouldn&#39;t apply our limitations to aliens. If they are as different as you say, they might be able to easily understand interstellar space travel the way we  easily understand tribal politics.</p>

<p>Once again you are looking at the universe from our limited human scope. Aliens might have ways to see and travel through vast distances in real time. Worm holes are one way.</p>

<p>Yes, I think this is a fair point. But it is also probably fair to say that there is going to be an inverse square relationship between how advanced an alien civilisation is, and how curious they are going to be about us. If they have advanced that far without destroying themselves with their own technology, I would argue this makes it probable that they would be relatively peaceful, and would have little interest in a species with our history of war.</p>

<p>I do take your point, but if I&#39;m honest I think we are judging the wrong characteristic entirely. I do not think it is curiosity which has gotten humans to this technological plateau, but rather their desire to dominate, control and hold power over each other. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I think you may have misunderstood my point a little here. The sentence you quoted was metaphorical, in that I was using it to illustrate just how big a physical problem it is to cross interstellar space. The way that physics works makes it extremely difficult for any two species to find each other because time is a factor as well as distance. The output from our planet has to reach the other civilisation before they can know that we are here, and that could potentially take millions of years. Hence, even if they had somehow developed FTL travel it wouldn&#39;t make much difference to the probability that they could visit us.</p>

<p>Once again, I refer you to what I have just written. It doesn&#39;t make any difference. I&#39;m not looking at it from a human scope, but rather simply considering what the laws of physics allow.</p>

<p>I understand your point but I think you are making the mistake of taking our current understanding of the universe and it&#39;s physical limitations and making them permanent across all time and forms of life. What might seem like universal rules set in stone to us could be childs play to space-faring aliens. Considering how far we have advanced in our understand of the universe and in physics, it would be foolhardy at best to think that what we know now is all there is to know.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t a mistake to think that reality has universal laws. It does have universal laws. And they don&#39;t discriminate between different forms of life. Unless the civilisation was right on our doorstep, then chances are very remote that they would have the required technology to find and reach us. We&#39;re talking about a level of knowledge which would make them gods by our standards, and that&#39;s even if things like time travel (into the past) and creating wormholes on tap is even possible, which is still highly debateable. I&#39;m not discounting the possibility entirely -- and I made that clear from the beginning -- but I am trying to explain how unlikely it is, and this is supported by the lack of hard evidence regarding alien visitation.</p>

<p>tell us more about how </p>

<p>In Einstein&#39;s equations, both mass and pressure contribute to a gravitational field.

<p>dunning kruger effect in full swing here? or are you just backpedaling, because I can quote 3 different times you say gravitomagnetism is magnetism created with a gravitational field</p>

<p>and right here again you&#39;re saying I&#39;m confusing gravitomagnetism (a gravitational field that behaves like a dipole electromagnetic field when rotated) with magnetic polar activity </p>

<p>let&#39;s reiterate, gravitomagnetism has nothing to do with actual magnetism </p>

<p>since an electromagnetic field is dipole, and a gravitomagnetic field acts like an electromagenetic one and even shares nearly the same equations (hence the name, and all those links you didn&#39;t read but instead cherry picked lines you misinterpreted), it too is dipole. granted, the negative pole is incredibly weak until the field starts rotating very rapidly, but rapidly enough and the field could spit you into space. </p>

<p>I linked an entire paper called &quot;guidelines to antigravity&quot;</p>

<p>the whole paper talks about generating and harnessing a strong enough gravitomagnetic field</p>

<p>in it there&#39;s a figure that labels a gravtiomagnetic field as dipole gravity</p>

<p>I linked you this straightforward paper written for laymen and even pointed out the figure, but of course you had no response because even a hypocritical idiot like you can&#39;t ignore how wrong it makes you</p>

<p>at this point I think you&#39;re being intentionally obtuse here and just refuse to admit you were wrong, but if you really are this retarded then good luck getting out of your mother&#39;s basement. </p>

<p>As is the science which suggests it is possible. You&#39;re getting into pure speculation here. Obviously a person cannot travel from width to length, or from time to height. The concept of &quot;inter-dimensional travel&quot; is just an idea brought about by the quantum theory that there are extra spatial dimensions we don&#39;t know about. There&#39;s no proof there actually are extra spatial dimensions we don&#39;t know about.</p>

<p>Caught me out there. I didn&#39;t read the OP, just the title.</p>

<p>Though now I&#39;ve read the OP, he seems to be saying it was us playing around with anti-gravity and not aliens. That&#39;s even less plausible. We currently struggle just to leave the Earth&#39;s gravitational field.</p>

<p>Classified plane designs and weaponry, yes. Anti-gravity, no.</p>

<p>For the same reasons I would find the claim that we were playing with time travel implausible. It&#39;s theory. And one which we don&#39;t have the required energy to experiment with.</p>

<p>If we conducted experiments with anti-gravity during the Cold War, then why are we still using rocket propulsion to get into space in 2015?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and your comparison of gravity manipulation to time travel is laughable. you obviously can&#39;t be taken seriously</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In order to experiment with anti-gravity you would either need a working theory of quantum gravity, which nobody has, or, failing that, more power than exists on the entire Earth. Gravity is an extremely weak force in comparison to the other three. So much so that we can&#39;t even perceive it unless the field is emitted from something of a comparable mass to a planet.</p>

<p>Again, there is an extremely large gap between what you think this article says, and what it actually says. This is what it actually says:-</p>

<p><strong>Scientists funded by the European Space Agency believe they may have measured the gravitational equivalent of a magnetic field for the first time in a laboratory. Under certain special conditions the effect is much larger than expected from general relativity and could help physicists to make a significant step towards the long-sought-after quantum theory of gravity.</strong></p>

<p>Just so we are clear, this evidences that scientists were NOT experimenting with anti-gravity machines half a century ago.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it makes a good point. but aliens that can travel ftl may be looking for planets capable of sustaining life just like we are, and if so they&#39;re probably a lot more proficient at it. so even if they didn&#39;t have evidence that we&#39;re here they may be still be interested in visiting and studying our planet. </p>

<p>Nice. Really good point. By the time they know we exist, our civilisation will probably be long gone.</p>

<p>You launched into an aggressive ad hominem attack, so let&#39;s not split hairs about the definition of the words you used.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it mentions the &quot;gravitational equivalent of a magnetic field&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which again, has absolutely nothing to do with anti-gravity. Gravity does not work in the same way that magnetism does. Wherever you happen to be within the Earth&#39;s gravitational field, it will not spit you up into space. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>dipole gravity </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no such thing as fucking dipole gravity. Stop reading dodgy Russian blogs. In quantum mechanics, the electromagnetic force attracts particles with opposite charges and repulses those with identical charges. Contradictorily, nobody has even discovered the force-carrying gravity particle, so how exactly do you propose they have seen it repelling anything?</p>

<p>The very fact that your article is about a quantum experiment discredits your claims of a real-world application, because there is no quantum theory of gravity. </p>
