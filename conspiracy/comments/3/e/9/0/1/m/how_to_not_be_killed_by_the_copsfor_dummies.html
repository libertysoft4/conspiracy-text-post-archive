        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Mike Brown, Eric Garner, Freddy Grey, Sandra Bland. What do these four have in common? Well, the obvious, is they were all killed by police, and all are also black. OK, what else do they all have in common? They all committed actions that in turn resulted in their deaths. I am not a police officer, I do know several, and I know there are good and bad cops out there, just as there are good and bad people out there. Point is, the police have a very dangerous job, and put their lives at risk as soon as the suit up for the day. It is stressful to say the least. Now, all four of the aforementioned individuals, each and every one of them argued, and FOUGHT back against the police. Rule #1 : When you are pulled over or confronted by the police, like it or not they are in control, and for the time being you are to cooperate fully and not try and argue or pull away from them. The second you do you become a deadly threat in their eyes. Do as your told(as much as you think you are right) and take your ticket and wait until court if you are truly not guilty to fight and argue. I leave you wiith this funny Chris Rock sketch but how true it is. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QR465HoCWFQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QR465HoCWFQ</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t ever say that. She was annoyed for the reason she got pulled over and explained it to him. She was being reasonable, even smoking a cigarette to relax. The cop was the one who not only instigated the conflict, but caused it to climax because he felt he was being disrespected by a civilian. Cops treat civilians like they are in the chain of command. A civilian has the lowest rank for them and we should ACT LIKE IT. Respect is earned not given. </p>

<p>Pro-Tip? You&#39;re a professional? At what submitting to authority and giving up your rights? </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t the first time someone died while in police custody, it won&#39;t be the last. I advocate for civil disobedience, things don&#39;t change without it. Giving up your personal freedoms for personal safety is kinda the opposite of what America was founded on, what our forefathers died for and what our military is meant to protect.

<p>I believe violence only brings about more violence. I&#39;m not justifying the recent killings, but have you noticed in most videos released the person is belgerant and non responsive to what the police ask them to do? A little civility can go along way. </p>

<p>Chances are if you look up those cases that the link about killing cops in an illegal arrest situation they involved something more substantial than no turn signal and not putting out your cigarette. </p>

<p>Laws in this country aren&#39;t as set in stone as people think ; they are more fluid. </p>
