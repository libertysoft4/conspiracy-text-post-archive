<li><p>In 1911, Turkey established gun control. From 1915-1917, 1.5 million Armenians, unable to defend themselves against their ethnic-cleansing government, were arrested and exterminated.</p></li>
<li><p>In 1929, the former Soviet Union established gun control as a means of controlling the “more difficult” of their citizens. From 1929 to the death of Stalin, 40 million Soviets met an untimely end at the hand of various governmental agencies as they were arrested and exterminated.</p></li>
<li><p>After the rise of the Nazi’s, Germany established their version of gun control in 1938 and from 1939 to 1945, 13 million Jews, gypsies, homosexuals, the mentally ill, and others, who were unable to defend themselves against the “Brown Shirts”, were arrested and exterminated. Interestingly, the Brown Shirts were eventually targeted for extermination themselves following their blind acts of allegiance to Hitler. Any American military and police would be wise to grasp the historical significance of the Brown Shirts’ fate.</p></li>
<li><p>After Communist China established gun control in 1935, an estimated 50 million political dissidents, unable to defend themselves against their fascist leaders, were arrested and exterminated.</p></li>
<li><p>Closer to home, Guatemala established gun control in 1964. From 1964 to 1981, 100,000 Mayans, unable to defend themselves against their ruthless dictatorship, were arrested and exterminated.</p></li>
<li><p>Uganda established gun control in 1970. From 1971 to 1979, 300,000 Christians, unable to defend themselves from their dictatorial government, were arrested and exterminated.</p></li>
<li><p>Cambodia established gun control in 1956. From 1975 to 1977, one million of the “educated” people, unable to defend themselves against their fascist government, were arrested and exterminated.</p></li>
<li><p>In 1994, Rwanda disarmed the Tutsi people and being unable to defend themselves from their totalitarian government, nearly one million were summarily executed.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The total numbers of victims who lost their lives because of gun control is approximately 70 million people in the 20th century. The historical voices from 70 million corpses speak loudly and clearly to those Americans who are advocating for a de facto gun ban. </p>

<p>Governments murdered four times as many civilians as were killed in all the international and domestic wars combined. </p>

<p>Governments murdered millions more people than were killed by common criminals and it all followed gun control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Chicago here. Some of the toughest, if not THE toughest, gun control laws in the nation and there are 6 murders per day...all by gangbangers with illegal guns that most of trace back to Mississippi 25 years ago. In fact, as in CT, we have the toughest gun laws but the most gun violence. Study after study shows that when law abiding people have access to guns firearm violence drops...dramatically. See Kennesaw GA for more on this...you are basically required to own a firearm to live there by law...and the amount of gun violence in the last 25 years? Zero. Does a little kid get ahold of a gun and shoot themselves occasionally? Not really with the police giving out gun safes and trigger locks. </p>

<p>Law abiding people who wish only to defend themselves are the <em>only</em> ones hindered by these retarded laws. For the criminals in Chicago, a gun is $200 and a pair of Beats headphones away. No checks required, no hindrance whatsoever by &#39;gun control.&#39; </p>

<p>We need &#39;Gang Control&#39; but the Chicago pigs are all pussies and have been paid off by the gangs.</p>

There are still firearms in the UK but controls are quite severe, if you take a long walk out in the country it&#39;s easy enough to see a farmer with a shotgun or even a hunting rifle occasionally though. We&#39;re generally happy with the arrangement too, the armed police units deal with armed criminals, but this is pretty rare too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They helped us not get shot by a moronic neighbour over an argument about a hedge, or shot by a partner because it appeared we might be having an affair. The fact is criminals very rarely go armed with firearms as the sentencing would be doubly brutal, and the police would turn up with H&amp;Ks. </p>

<p>18th century for the Scots, 1800 or thereabouts they were still hang drawing and quartering tax refuseniks in Scotland. a mere two hundred years ago.</p>

<p>the Welsh suffered in earlier centuries. English town laws about no Welshmen allowed inside city walls during hours of darkness etc. pain of death etc.</p>

<p>you are a moron if you think a disarmed population is safe with psychopaths running a country.</p>

You&#39;re all here, Americans, on a conspiracy sub, complaining that your government is fucking you up the ass, while simultaneously you seem to believe that guns are protecting you from the government. </p>

<p>Get it through your head that they aren&#39;t. If your government was enforcing an armed presence, which regularly bullied and shot people, like say for example in the occupied territories, then guns are going to prove very useful. But it is not guns which are used to control modern western societies except as a last resort. If any western government used guns to shoot an organised movement of unarmed civilians it would be the end of that government.</p>

<p>We are in the information age and it is through information that people are manipulated, controlled and enslaved. This is not the 18th century any more. Things have evolved. </p>

<p>Just look at the real world result of the &quot;protection of guns&quot; in your country right now. 30,000 gun-related deaths a year, one of the world&#39;s highest prison populations, and a government which is fucking you harder than ever before in the ass. It isn&#39;t corrupt government officials who are dying in gunfights: it&#39;s poor, underprivileged kids from the most impoverished and neglected areas. Guns are hurting the very sections of society you seem to think they are protecting.</p>

<p>Total, utter, jaw-dropping nonsense. Guns are the opposite of freedom. What freedom is there from being worried about getting shot on your way to the 7/11? What freedom is there in having to have bullet proof glass on your store windows? </p>

You all use exactly the same generic everything-in-a-can arguments which, if you had any common sense, you would realise is a big fucking clue that they are fallacies.</p>

<p>You must abuse the purpose of a knife or a car to use them as weapons. The purpose of a gun <em>is</em> to use it as a weapon. It&#39;s literally like trying to compare a brick to a nuclear submarine and saying you have to make the sub legal because the brick is legal. It&#39;s such a ridiculously stupid thing to say it borders on the outright insane.</p>

<p>You&#39;re absolutely right that the purpose of a gun <em>is</em> to use it as a weapon, but if it <em>is not</em> used, and only possessed, it is merely a deterrent.  The mere fact that there are countless firearms possessed as weapons, but not used as such, by millions of Americans is a strength in and of itself.  They do not need to be utilized in order for them to be an effective deterrent of whatever perceived oppression certain conspiracy theorists believe.  It is not the object itself that directly harms, but rather, it is the application with which the user has employed the object that does the harm.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t fault that logic. However, there is some research which suggests that merely owning a gun increases the likelihood of you both shooting someone, and <em>being</em> shot yourself. One possible explanation for that is that it becomes a matter of ownership psychology (i.e. if the purpose of a gun is to use it as a weapon, and you&#39;re not using it as a weapon, then what is the purpose of owning the gun?)</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes, I agree that it&#39;s a strength, but I think it&#39;s just human nature that a lot of people have no desire to kill or hurt others. Look at it this way: if you aren&#39;t prepared to use your gun as anything more than a deterrent, then what happens when you get into an argument with someone who is? Whichever way you approach the problem, saturating your society with guns negatively affects the moral intellectuals and benefits the rapists, the backwoods serial killers and the robbers, because they are the people to whom guns are most useful. </p>

<p>Imagine two 22 year olds who both go into the gun shop on the same day and both purchase guns. One of them is like you. He only wants the weapon in case of an emergency. The other is dreaming of raping you at gunpoint. Who do you think is most likely to be in trouble? You see what I&#39;m saying?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is not the object itself that directly harms, but rather, it is the application with which the user has employed the object that does the harm.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree with everything you&#39;ve said, but my conclusions are different. Yes, it is true that both the person and the weapon are needed to shoot someone, but you can&#39;t ban people. Hence you only really have two options left:-</p>

<p>A) Put up with gun violence. Or</p>

<p>B) Ban guns.</p>

<p>The point is that society should be making it as difficult as possible -- within reason, of course -- to hurt each other. Saturating a society with guns does the complete opposite. And, on top of that, the economic system is ruthless. Factors such as these work in tandem to encourage violence in America.</p>

<p>I upvoted your post because I thought it was fair and very intelligently written. I&#39;m pretty impressed tbh. I don&#39;t often find it easy to converse with people who challenge my thinking. Not so with you.</p>

<p>What? I&#39;m not religious in any way, shape or form. Are you sure you&#39;ve used the right word?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Research shows gun regulation makes us less safe</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Common sense shows that no it doesn&#39;t. The &quot;research&quot; you think you are referring to is industry-sponsored propaganda, not research. Even flat-Earthers claim to have research to support their case. We live in a world where convincing people of things which aren&#39;t true has become a multi-billion dollar business.</p>

<p>In Britain, there are around 100 gun deaths a year. In America, there are around 30,000. Hence, how stupid do you think it sounds to me, when you say you have &quot;research&quot; which &quot;shows gun regulation makes us less safe&quot;? You have never had a countrywide ban on guns in America, so how could you possibly &quot;research&quot; the effect of a countrywide ban on guns?</p>

<p>It seems to have become commonplace in America -- and this is largely the fault of politicians -- that when your argument is flat out ridiculous but you don&#39;t want to give it up, you find some &quot;research&quot; which &quot;proves&quot; your case. </p>

<p>Paraphrased conclusion: despite our common sense telling us that gun regulation means less guns means less violence, the evidence shows this not to be the case.</p>

<p>What now? You&#39;re gonna cry because Harvard has been bought out by the NRA? Get me a fucking violin so I can play you a sad sonata or grow the fuck out of your delusions.</p>

<p>Guess what? There are almost exactly five times as many people in the US as in the UK – 314 million vs. 63 million. Guess what else? The violent crime rate in the UK is 3,100 per 100,000, and in the US it is 380 per 100,000 population.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Sure. Once you make guns illegal, anybody who owns one is no longer a law-abiding citizen. Hence, they are criminals and need to be dealt with accordingly. Make examples of the first ten cases which come through the court system. Then, even the criminals won&#39;t want guns because gun possession is giving them more time in jail than the crime they used the gun for in the first place.</p>

<p>Pretty soon your gun problem goes away. There will always be gun violence, of course, but the clear point is that we should be working to reduce it, not actively encouraging it by selling every Tom, Dick and Harry weapons which could take out an entire bus queue.</p>

<p>The US constitution was written 250 years ago, when the best quality weapon was a single-shot musket which took nearly a full minute to reload.

<p>Why is it that whenever you are faced with any reasons about why guns are bad for society, you always want to change the subject to cars? What the fuck do cars have to do with guns? Just why on fucking Earth do you think something invented to get you to work in the morning is the same as something invented to kill you?</p>

<p>Using precisely the same logic you have just used, I could defend rape. I could rape you in the mouth, and when you started crying about it, I could just say, &quot;Well, should we ban sex?&quot; People who have sex often end up with dicks in their mouths, so does that mean we should ban it?</p>

Also guns are not designed solely for the reason of killing your fellow human being. They can be used as a deterrent, as a tool for hunting/pest control or as a piece of sporting equipment. Lastly yes they can be used for the purpose of home defense. </p>

<p>I see nothing wrong with that and neither does the law in the majority of the United States. Once again eat your fucking heart out.</p>

<p>Your literally using the same argument in relation to guns</p>

<p>So you make an argument, I make an analogy of the argument, and then you claim the analogy applies to me, not you? That isn&#39;t reasoned debate. You&#39;re basically just saying, &quot;I know you are, you said you are, but what am I?&quot; That&#39;s something I&#39;d expect to hear in a playground.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you not agree that in the wrong hands whether by incompetence or malevolence vehicles are also a weapon?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We have discussed this point at length and I have explained why the comparison between guns and cars is an unjust one. I have no desire to keep going around in a circle. Cars can be used as a weapons, but Guns <em>are</em> weapons. It is like trying to compare a fork to a nuclear bomb and saying that, because the fork is legal, the nuclear bomb should be legal, because they can both be used as weapons.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They can be used as a deterrent</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And what deterrent exists in an item you are not prepared to use?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>as a tool for hunting/pest control </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So they can be used for murdering animals as well as people? Well, that&#39;s good to know. I guess that makes everything OK then, right?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I see nothing wrong with that and neither does the law in the majority of the United States</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are refusing to see anything wrong with it because you aren&#39;t acknowledging the arguments I make which explain what is wrong with it. You simply make an argument, I refute it, you ignore the refutation, and several posts later repeat the same argument again.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You strike me as one of those liberals who is so soft and incapable</p>

<p>You strike me as one of those people who has to insult people to misdirect the audience away from the fact that he doesn&#39;t have any reasonable argument.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You strike me as completely uneducated. You probably learned maths from Tupac records.</p>

<p>But your logic breaks down at the point where you decide what someone else intends to do. Many innocent people have -- and continue to -- die that way. Flip it around. Let&#39;s say you&#39;re acting aggressive and someone shoots you in the face. That fair?</p>

<p>Well, it isn&#39;t beneficial to the animals you&#39;re killing, is it? How about you let the animal live and sacrifice yourself, instead? You, know, for the &quot;benefit of the eco-system&quot;. Interested in that?</p>

<p>Cool. This is the third time in one post you&#39;ve confused the contraction of &quot;you are&quot; with the possessive pronoun, &quot;your&quot;. This causes me to question whether you do actually understand my arguments, as you claim.</p>

<p>Nah. This sounds like you think reality works like a movie, where bad people are always punished and the good guys always ride off into the sunset. As the world discovered with the Zimmerman case, once you kill the other guy, as long as there are no other credible witnesses nearby then you can pretty much get away with murder.</p>

<p>In fact, flip it around entirely. Say I have a gun and you catch me doing something illegal. I <em>don&#39;t</em> want to face the consequences of my actions, hence I pull the trigger and end you.</p>

<p>The problem isn&#39;t that it is complicated, but rather that you have an irrational confirmation bias. You only see one side and not the other.</p>

<p>Bro, I fully understand that you&#39;ve got some batshit maniac cops over there, but the reason they are <em>that</em> dangerous is...</p>

<p>Wait for it...</p>

<p>Because they&#39;ve all got guns.</p>

<p>The self-defence argument is a circular fallacy. The reason you feel like you need a gun to protect yourself, is because everybody is walking around with a fucking gun. You can&#39;t arm good citizens without also arming the bad ones. It&#39;s impossible. And which group do you think is going to be the group using the guns?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not what I think. It&#39;s what evidence shows. Evidence shows that gun regulation prevents good citzens from being armed which in turn promotes their exploitation by criminals.</p>

<p>So you&#39;d have good people surrender their weapons because bad people own guns? Your logic is sorely lacking.</p>

<p>We already have guns. If we didn&#39;t, it&#39;d be different, but it isn&#39;t. In fact, plenty of America doesn&#39;t have guns. In the places where fun control is tight, criminals and cops are the only ones armed and go figure if they don&#39;t exploit the fuck out of unarmed good people.</p>

<p>On the other end of the spectrum is places like Keneesaw, GA where gun ownership is practically mandatory and they went over 25 years without a homicide.</p>

<p>Cops aren&#39;t dangerous because they have guns. They&#39;re dangerous because they&#39;re indoctrinated to see civilians as dangerous criminals. They&#39;re dangerous because they&#39;re unaccountable for their crimes. They&#39;re dangerous because power such as theirs primes them for corruption.</p>

<p>They&#39;re not dangerous because they have guns. Millions of people own guns who aren&#39;t dangerous. The danger doesn&#39;t reside in the tool. It resides in the mindset that uses the tool for evil.</p>

<p>Bias and agendas abound on this issue. My most recent pet theory revolves around a pro-gun agenda disguised as an anti-gun agenda. Nobody has sold more guns to civilians than fear mongering liberals. Load up the powderkeg till it&#39;s overflowing then light the fuse and run.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the few things that the US has going for it is the resistance to gun control.  I seriously think that if the government were able to ban the guns they would,  but they cannot do that without an armed resistance potentially destroying the government.  As a thought exercise, let&#39;s say that the government banned guns in 2000.  What would the US look like today?  I know I would not feel as safe, and the people&#39;s fear would increase.  I don&#39;t think we would be in a better place.  Our guns may be the only thing that stands in the way of government totally enslaving the population.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t myself investigated this, however if I think about it critically, it is exactly what a perfectly designed government program to get rid of guns would consist of:</p>

<p>A. Buy up all the most popular guns and ammo so that the prices become prohibited to key demographics.</p>

<p>B. Have the major Ammo/Gun manufacturers buy out everyone else and put Gov&#39;t cronies into management</p>

<p>C. Start a secret gun buy back program funded with tax payer dollars like might already be happening</p>

<p>You&#39;re already part of a large, anonymous crowd of millions of people who possess guns. A true tactician would maintain their anonymity prior to carrying out any &quot;decisive actions&quot;.</p>

<p>In other words, the only way for TPTB to neutralize all potential &quot;insurrectionists&quot; would be by bombing the entire fucking country. I suppose that that is a remote possibility-- but if you&#39;re gonna worry about that you might as well worry about an asteroid precipitating an epochal cataclysm as well.</p>

<p>Have you ever looked into that one?  I used to buy the trope that it was a civil conflict generated by hate between the &quot;tribalism&quot; of hutus and tutsis.  However, when you dig into it, there was a concerted effort to foment this genocide by western powers.  </p>

<p>This is the part that I always hated about these people. I mean seriously, I know they already fucked in the head just doing their jobs, but what the fuck are they thinking? </p>

<p><em>&quot;I mean sure, I work for a genocidal group of mass murderers, people who treat others as literal farm cattle and sleep at night like a baby after murdering children and raping dead bodies. I mean, yeah it&#39;s soulless, heartless human meat grinder that obliterates everything in it&#39;s path from top to bottom, from poor to the highest elites, but it&#39;s okay because some how I won&#39;t be the one to get shredded to bits instantly by the combine machines. For some bizarre and inconspicuous reason, Jesus decided I&#39;m special and that for no apparent reason I&#39;m the only being immune to this system.</em></p>

<p>Basically I love it when cops get thrown into prisons, and they are at first confused as fuck, because they don&#39;t understand why all these people around them are suddenly throwing them in a cage in chains treating them like dirt and taking their life away. They do this all day everyday, and yet it never registers to them that they are nothing more than tools, components for a machine that has no need for human compassion, only blood to feed it&#39;s bowels.</p>

The list just goes on and on. So what do we see outside of the States? Nine people dead, let&#39;s get rid of a flag! </p>

<p>WTF?</p>

<p>In Australia we had a couple of massacres back to back. So the Government did something. Gun control. People drank and drove and lots of people died. The government did something, RBT and heavy fines. Cyber stalking was causing problems so the government did something. Jail time and fines. </p>

<p>In America, you guys just don&#39;t care. It&#39;s all about what happened 200 years ago, why? It&#39;s about laws you seem unwilling to change, it borders on a regilous zeal. So why should I care? Four Serving Presidents are dead, chuck in a few Congress men, a few mayors and it just highlights the will of the people means nothing. </p>

<p>So please explain why I should care if in the next 40 days another massacre happens? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What truth? I haven&#39;t withdrawn, I&#39;m active in public life and community. So I&#39;m not sure what your thinking.</p>

<p>If you truly believe that innocent people praying in a house of worship or kids younger than ten years old in a school or a President elected by common vote is more important than your single right to bear arms, well, you are part of the reason America is on this terrible decline. </p>

<p>There is no matrix, it&#39;s far far worse. It&#39;s life. It&#39;s mean cruel and totally ruthless and worst of all random in nature.  If you draw comfort from the idea the Government or some unnamed force or group is responsible, words leave me. America stuffed up Iran in the 50&#39;s, most of South America in the 60&#39;s. Balls up Vietnam, Loas, Thailand. Went back to Iran in the 70&#39;s &amp; 80. Also lets chuck in Iraq, Indonsiea &amp; Australia. Yes, you guys got Whitlam chucked out. And you think the Governemnt is smart enough to create this terrible cancer in your community!</p>

<p>So please, point to racial law changes that have stripped your rights? Meaning you can&#39;t travel, can&#39;t vote, can&#39;t do what ever you want. There are no men black snatching up citizens. No towns been blocked off. No stripping of guns. But you could go to Africa to see that or parts of Asia. It&#39;s a real everyday event there.</p>

<p>Instead the young, the old and just in the wrong place at the wrong time are dying at around 30,000 to 50,000 a year due to guns. And you seem ok with that!? I thought America was about community, clearly it&#39;s become all for one and one for one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. I&#39;ve mulled over your list and feel there is a fatal flaw to the argument. All the countries listed were never a Democratic country at the time of the massacres. Meaning citizens were never given the chance to purchase or stock pile guns. Also, all lacked major small arms manufacters that sold to their citizens.</p>

<p>Second, all countries listed had moved from the feudal system to autocratic rule.</p>

<p>Thirdly, most of the population were farmers, uneducated, widely spread over the country. They were in short the lowest of third world countries. Russia while a naval power house was never a centre of excellence in any other field. Very little of the wealth left the hands of the elite. </p>

<p>I think if you want to discuss what happens to a country and its neighbours when guns are removed just look to Ireland, Northern Ireland and Great Britain.

<p>Does that also mean that because one person drinks, gets behind the wheel and kills someone that we ban all cars?</p>

<p>Why is it that whenever you are faced with any reasons about why guns are bad for society, you always want to change the subject to cars? What the fuck do cars have to do with guns? Just why on fucking Earth do you think something invented to get you to work in the morning is the same as something invented to kill you?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve even explained why such a comparison is a fallacy, several times throughout the thread, but you just don&#39;t listen. It goes into one ear and out of the other ear. </p>

<p>Using precisely the same logic you have just used, I could defend rape. I could rape you in the mouth, and when you started crying about it, I could just say, &quot;Well, should we ban sex?&quot; People who have sex often end up with dicks in their mouths, so does that mean we should ban it?</p>

<p>The arguments you are trying to use are just insane.</p>
