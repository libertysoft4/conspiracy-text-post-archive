    <div class="md"><p>This sub has been constantly discredited for the past few years. I&#39;ve seen it in many posts across reddit where the users will point to all of the racist stuff that goes on in here. If you weren&#39;t aware, it&#39;s extremely easy to pretend to be a racist. That isn&#39;t to say racists aren&#39;t here. I know some are. I&#39;m also pretty sure a lot of it is fake. <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/128s2h/i_noticed_this_today_while_browsing_reddit_seem/">Here is just one example of a former r/news mod pretending to be an antisemite in this sub</a>. (click on the screenshot and look at the link flair. Bipolarbear0 was logged into his account, screenshotted it, then logged into a fake account and posted here. Also see all of the other antisemitic posts he submitted here)</p>

<p>No matter the percentage of fake racist garbage in here, I&#39;d say just ignore it. Perhaps a few of them can be talked out of their racism? Who knows. The most important thing to take away from this is the fact that since we are being targeted, there must be content here that is good enough for &quot;them&quot; (whoever they are) to go after this sub. So, in a roundabout way, it&#39;s a good sign. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sick of bigots and idiots who insult rather than discuss.  We also should probably urge the promotion/creation of a sub for people to discuss pyramidal magic and ley lines and such.  I&#39;m tired of that here.  [In all fairness I insult that stuff sometimes because it makes so little sense.]  This sub is about conspiracies, not completely illogical and disprovable &quot;magic&quot;, faked ancient giants and disprovable ancient civilizations with flying machines.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not that I&#39;m just noticing. It just seems like in the last two weeks or so, there has been an uptick in these types of trash posts.

Sometimes, I&#39;m hesitant to post because of thise issues.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been on Reddit since the beginning like 2006ish and well under many different user names. What I noticed was /conspiracy has already been destroyed. /conspiracy use to be not as raciest, in fact it was really rare to read raciest commentary on here.   </p>

<p>just because you believe in conspiracies does not mean you are a raciest but racism is the easiest and quickest way to divide a community. people would come to this sub to discuss anything and everything related to their own personal versions of conspiracies and would also link to news events that support their claim. In the end this sub takes all news and links that support any conspiracies that other subs wont, for the fact of anti censorship alone.  </p>

<p>what happened next was the sharing of views and this became a threat for some outsiders, they started a mass campaign against mods and users of this sub, this sub was brigaded and then an attacking sub decided it would be fun to flood /conspiracy with raciest content. As others pointed out there is tons of proof out there, i don&#39;t think i need to link any, you can search for yourself. In fact there were not just one but several subs created to flood this sole sub.</p>

<p>for some reason now conspiracies are also &quot;streamlined&quot; in this sub, if you don&#39;t believe the group thought here then your conspiracy version is not valid. This view had changed, originally you could bring a viewpoint and others would elaborate on it but i think since trolls and shills moved in if you think differently then may be considered a shill or troll.   </p>

<p>in the end, this sub went on defense against shills and trolls and lots of its users have left or routinely change names. I left myself because I don&#39;t believe racism applies to typical conspiracies.  Also the amount of anti post made it NSFW for me. After the outsiders flooding this raciest commentary on here this sub looks less creditable and is in no way looking like its former self, it will never go back also if there is a persistent threat against it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s sad that you had to leave based on the changing low value threads being posted. I find myself basically weeding through the nonsense &amp; racist trash to find the informative, insightful gems that are still in here.

Reddit is definitely not my only source for info, thanks to some kind people on this sub who directed me to a plethora of sites. I may abandon ship at some point as well, but I&#39;m hoping things in here will turn. Hopefully that&#39;s not just wishful thinking on my part.</p>
