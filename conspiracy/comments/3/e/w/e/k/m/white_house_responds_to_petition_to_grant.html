<p><strong>A Response to Your Petition on Edward Snowden</strong></p>

<p>Thanks for signing a petition about Edward Snowden. This is an issue that many Americans feel strongly about. Because his actions have had serious consequences for our national security, we took this matter to Lisa Monaco, the President&#39;s Advisor on Homeland Security and Counterterrorism. Here&#39;s what she had to say:</p>

<p>&quot;Since taking office, President Obama has worked with Congress to secure appropriate reforms that balance the protection of civil liberties with the ability of national security professionals to secure information vital to keep Americans safe.</p>

<p>As the President said in announcing recent intelligence reforms, &quot;We have to make some important decisions about how to protect ourselves and sustain our leadership in the world, while upholding the civil liberties and privacy protections that our ideals and our Constitution require.&quot;</p>

<p>Instead of constructively addressing these issues, Mr. Snowden&#39;s dangerous decision to steal and disclose classified information had severe consequences for the security of our country and the people who work day in and day out to protect it.</p>

<p>If he felt his actions were consistent with civil disobedience, then he should do what those who have taken issue with their own government do: Challenge it, speak out, engage in a constructive act of protest, and -- importantly -- accept the consequences of his actions. He should come home to the United States, and be judged by a jury of his peers -- not hide behind the cover of an authoritarian regime. Right now, he&#39;s running away from the consequences of his actions.</p>

<p>We live in a dangerous world. We continue to face grave security threats like terrorism, cyber-attacks, and nuclear proliferation that our intelligence community must have all the lawful tools it needs to address. The balance between our security and the civil liberties that our ideals and our Constitution require deserves robust debate and those who are willing to engage in it here at home.&quot;</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This is way huger than anyone else has realized.  <a href="http://recode.net/2015/03/19/edward-snowden-would-like-to-explain-himself-to-a-jury-but-he-cant/">Snowden has previously agreed to that</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He’s even willing to stand trial for the crimes he’s been charged with: Specifically one charge of theft of government property, and two charges of violating the Espionage Act of 1917. If only it were that simple.</p>

<p>The Espionage Act basically makes it impossible for a person to defend himself or herself against the charges by explaining any extenuating reason for disclosing information the government considers secret.</p>

<p>“I want to tell the jury why I did it,” Snowden said. “I want to tell the court what these programs are. I want the jury to decide whether it was right or wrong that our rights were being violated in secret. I’m forbidden from doing that.”</p>

<p>In this paragraph they play the fear card.  You should be more afraid of terrorism (which causes less deaths per year than lightning strikes) than you should be afraid of a government that can literally sift through your &quot;private&quot; icloud storage and trade your naked pictures like baseball cards.  </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes we are aware that the government always tells us what we want to hear.  Meanwhile this data collection has been declared illegal but continues to be carried by unelected government intelligence (spy) agencies who have become a parallel entity that is almost completely independent of our constitutionally elected government and escapes all accountability when something goes wrong.  It has literally become a shadow government.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As the President said in announcing recent intelligence reforms, &quot;We have to make some important decisions about how to protect ourselves and sustain our leadership in the world, while upholding the civil liberties and privacy protections that our ideals and our Constitution require.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We don&#39;t need to be the world police. We need to worry about leading ourselves here at home.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>If our intelligence agencies were constructively doing their jobs without destructively breaking the law and violating the most basic constitutional protections that form the very foundation of our free society... then Snowden wouldn&#39;t have had an excuse to steal and leak anything.  I would be cheering on his execution myself if the government wasn&#39;t doing anything illegal!  He leaked this information to us! He didn&#39;t sell military secrets to Russia or Iran.  He gave the american people their own secrets,  the secret that our government no Longer gives a shit about our silly little &quot;rights&quot;.</p>

<p>Please don&#39;t put POTUS in the same category as a white supremest regime that has controlled the world for the last few centuries. It&#39;s not only incorrect, it&#39;s retarded to do so.</p>

<p>While he may have blue-blood because of his mother, his teachings and understandings of the world is waaaaaay more cultured then many of you give him any credit for. He understands not only the rich but the poor as well, he has lived a lifestyle that has guaranteed him to be truly understand of many things. Many of you should read up on Obama, he has literally lived a &quot;Jesus&quot; style life. There is probably not many who can say the same and take office amongst the people. Most of the politicians who get in office are white,rich and completely out of touch with reality.</p>

<p>Does that mean it&#39;s true? Who knows? What we do know is that no major new source reported such a thing only independents. Am I to trust the words of a Zionist Anglo-Saxon like Alex Jones? I don&#39;t think so. What I do know is the good he has done, his sexual preference I give not a care in the world about.</p>

<p>When speaking the Jesus lifestyle I took the love that the book claims Jesus understood and binded that with Obama. Obama is able to love and really understand everyone because he was brought up in the perfect scenario in which he could. Many whites will never live nor see rock bottom, Obama has, he&#39;s laid with the bums,the street kids,he&#39;s laughed with kings, well educated,mannered,Just the right amount of swag and sophisticated. This sub-Reddit will still call him the devil because they do not see because they don&#39;t want too.</p>

<p>I suppose they did the same when Jesus came along back then, oh wait.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe, one thing is for sure, he is a puppet for another system, not the corrupt one in place now. Every movement and action is against everything that Old America was highly for, I see a powerful, fully socialist country in the near future no doubt. </p>

<p>With the way things are looking, almost everyone in the world is angry with the old system created for the self serving populous of America. We wouldn&#39;t last 10 seconds against China and Russia, we are completely divided because of a system that just doesn&#39;t work</p>

<p>Will the blacks fight for White America in 2015? Nope you can pretty much guarantee it will be another Vietnam. I&#39;m not dying for no racist system that literally hates me at every angle, I&#39;m not killing people the same hue as me for people who sub consciously hate me, I&#39;m not going to do any of that. Nope.</p>

<p>Try to stand up and say #blacklivesmatter and what happens? #whitelivesmatters pops up all of a sudden as if it&#39;s not rude to interrupt someones protest with the exact same hashtag as if it&#39;s some type of competition. All because blacks started standing up for themselves it somehow hurts the status quo. Of What? The system we all know exists but will not acknowledge. Because to acknowledge it would mean we had to face the problem and fix it, to fix it, people not of my persuasion would lose privileges that blacks clearly don&#39;t have.</p>

<p>After they took JFK from us, the people that took over this country, did as they pleased with it and even made sure to aim at blacks systematically from time to time as history has told us.</p>

<p>This is just shocking spin. Just shocking. Look at the appeals to emotion she makes to spice up her complete lack of argument: &quot;dangerous&quot;, &quot;steal&quot; etc... All he did was tell people the truth. Look at the dichotomy between her attack on Snowden and the appeals to emotion she makes in defence of her own argument: &quot;balance&quot;, &quot;protection&quot;. They are just empty words which she&#39;s trying to use to legitimise a completely unreasonable bias about Snowden based on the fact he exposed the government for illegal mass surveillance operations. He exposed them on the grounds of morality, and yet she&#39;s trying to paint him as the one who is immoral.</p>

<p>It makes me angry. I won&#39;t deny it.</p>
