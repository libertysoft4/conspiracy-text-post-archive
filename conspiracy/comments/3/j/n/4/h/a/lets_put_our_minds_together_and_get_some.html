        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Here are some I&#39;ve learned over the last decade.</p>

<p>1) Develop your mental discipline. Learn to meditate as it will become a useful tool in sifting through the mass amount of (dis)information available. Find a philosophy to guide you; many of the same principles can be found in Buddhism, Taoism, and Western esoteric traditions, but the same message can be found in many places.</p>

<p>&quot;All that is gold does not glitter, Not all those who wander are lost; The old that is strong does not wither, Deep roots are not reached by the frost.&quot;
&quot;Advice is a dangerous gift, even from the wise to the wise, and all courses may run ill.&quot;
&quot;All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.&quot;
&quot;Courage is found in unlikely places.&quot;
&quot;May it be a light to you in dark places, when all other lights go out.&quot; -<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a></p>

<p>2) Develop your physical health. Find a physical activity you enjoy and make it a habit. Invest in your body, whether its strength training with weight lifting or core stability with yoga. Food is your body&#39;s fuel and you should be applying the same investigative spirit to everything you eat. Your diet can have a large effect on your entire worldview. A healthy body requires a healthy mind, and if you neglect your body your mind will suffer as well.</p>

<p>3) Rest. Take it easy, relax, go outside and have fun. Play! Almost every religion has divine decree that there be a weekly day of rest (at the minimum), and for good reason. Looking into the darker aspects of reality can take its toll on anyone. You need to find time to take a mental break from all of this or you will start to break down. Remember, you&#39;re not dead yet and the sky isn&#39;t actually falling right now. Try to live in the moment instead of in anticipation of the moment.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all I have for now, hopefully the audience has more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cardio is catabolic, I&#39;d highly suggest some form of strength training as that will pay dividends into the future unlike any cardio training can.</p>

<p>There are a ton of really well researched articles here, backed by scientific principals, as to why strength training is a lot better for promoting health than aerobic training.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.startingstrength.com">www.startingstrength.com</a></p>

<p>Also, lifting weights is highly aerobic as it is. Ever done a limit set of 5 deadlifts? Your heart will be <em>pounding</em> after.</p>

<p>That being said, running is better than no exercise, and it&#39;s only really long distance running that is potentially harmful. If you are into shorter, more intense bouts of cardio then that&#39;s totally fine, but you should always be doing some form of strength training as well as strength is the most general adaptation and will improve your ability in all other physical endeavors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Strength training work will work your lungs, especially if you&#39;re working at the right intensity. A set of 5 deadlifts at &gt;90% of your 5 rep max will leave you gasping like no run can ever do. They key is intensity, almost any form of exercise works well if you&#39;re at the right intensity, just some forms are more efficient.</p>

<p>But yes I agree that you should always have a well rounded routine that includes more than just one type of training.</p>

<p>Try to stay understanding of others and do not judge. Be ready to forgive those that let you down. Remember that we were all once blind, deaf, and stupid. Not everyone can finish in the same place of a race. Let&#39;s help those that are behind. </p>

<p>Have confidence in where you are right now. Be proud of how much you&#39;ve witnessed, experienced, and learned. Do not allow others or external situations to overwhelm or control you with negative emotions. Be loving and honest to yourself and others. And keep growing!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Remember that most people don&#39;t share your views nor do they want to hear about your views. </p>

<p>There is an active movement in the intelligence communities to suppress thinking like this, keep this in mind when people bash conspiratorial thought.</p>

<p>One of the best things you can do is figure out what you believe about reality and your own being. Seeking inner meaning and self-guidance will be a huge help when you are in a rut or examining something that shakes you right to your bones (9/11, Iraq War, JFK etc.)</p>

<p>Please keep reading your history and your philosophy. The reason we know what the Hegellian Dialectic is, is because people bothered to read Hegel. Read your damn culture and you will understand why and how these things occur. If you&#39;ve never read Voltaire or Locke you won&#39;t know why the hell we have a Capitalist Democracy. </p>

<p>Stay mindful and clear headed of what is going on in the present, events in the 21st century appear to be accelerating every month. This will be especially helpful for avoiding riots, war zones and financial crashes.</p>

<p>Third look into gun ownership, a while back cops in PG county of Maryland killed some man in his car in his driveway. There was a big uproar about it. The cops said fuck you and didn&#39;t stop any crime. That could be where this nation is heading shortly, that or cops might go even more aggressive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Spend time with the anarchist and libertarian movements, they are like minded and better stocked with intellectuals than typical conspiracy circles (not a slight, it&#39;s just a fact). Their explanations for how we are dominated by the few are also easier to relate to mainstream folk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Understanding <em>why</em> people think they way that they do, and trying to empathize. Realize how possible it is that you&#39;d be just like [person you disagree with] if you had come from the same conditions as them.</p>

<p>Something along these lines is preached with regularity, but I doubt many really internalize it, because it&#39;s quite hard not to &#39;other&#39; people and turn to out-group hatred. But I feel like I&#39;ve managed to do so, and it really keeps me from getting angry when reading about the action or inaction of people I disagree with.</p>
