    <div class="md"><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has introduced legislation that would deal a tremendous blow to the U.S. dollar. If Putin gets his way, and he almost certainly will, the U.S. dollar will be eliminated from trade between nations that belong to the Commonwealth of Independent States.  </p>

<p>In addition to Russia, that list of countries includes Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Obviously this would not mean “the death of the dollar”, but it would be a very significant step toward the end of the era of the absolute dominance of the U.S. dollar.  </p>

<p>Most people don’t realize this, but more U.S. dollars are actually used outside of the United States than are used inside this country.  If the rest of the planet decides to stop accumulating dollars, using them to trade with one another, and loaning them back to us at ultra-low interest rates, we are going to be in for a world of hurt. Unfortunately for us, it is only a matter of time until that happens.</p>

<p>When I first read the following excerpt from a recent <a href="https://www.rt.com/business/313967-putin-says-dump-dollar/">RT article</a>, I was absolutely stunned…</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has drafted a bill that aims to eliminate the US dollar and the euro from trade between CIS countries.</p>

<p>This means the creation of a single financial market between Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and other countries of the former Soviet Union.</p>

<p>“This would help expand the use of national currencies in foreign trade payments and financial services and thus create preconditions for greater liquidity of domestic currency markets”, said a statement from Kremlin.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For a long time, tensions have been building between the United States and Russia over Syria, Ukraine, the price of oil and a whole host of other issues. But I didn’t anticipate that things would get to this level quite yet. It is expected that Putin’s new bill will become law, and this is only one element of a much larger trend that is now developing.</p>

<p>You see, the truth is that Russia and China have both been dumping dollar-denominated assets for months. The following comes from a recent <a href="http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/putin-targets-us-monetary-system-aims-to-eliminate-the-us-dollar-and-the-euro-from-trade_09012015">piece by Mac Slavo</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Last year Russia began <a href="http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/dollar-dump-begins-russia-unloads-20-of-its-total-u-s-holdings-in-one-month_02202015">unloading massive amounts</a> of their US dollar reserves. In the month of December 2014 alone Putin sold some 20% of the country’s U.S. Treasury, a move that further increased tensions surrounding what can only be described as economic warfare between East and West.</p>

<p>Then, as if part of a coordinated effort, this summer it was revealed that China had implemented a similar strategy, <a href="http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/shock-report-china-dumps-half-a-trillion-dollars-something-is-very-very-wrong-they-are-being-aggressively-sold_07222015">dumping half a trillion</a> in dollar denominated assets.</p>

<p>But that’s just the beginning of the end for the US dollar. Amid a major meltdown in Chinese stock markets the People’s Republic sold off billions in dollar assets last week in what was reported to be an effort to stabilize their collapsing financial markets.</p>

<p>And now, as Russia’s economy collapses under the weight of American and European sanctions, including what many believe to be widespread downward manipulation of oil prices, Vladimir Putin is sending a clear signal to the central bank of the world’s reserve currency.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>China has the second largest economy on the entire planet, and Russia has the tenth largest.  In recent years, these two superpowers have become much tighter.  For example, just consider this headline from Sputnik News that I came across just today: “<a href="http://www.sputniknews.com/politics/20150902/1026488359/washington-foreign-policy-failure-asia-alliance.html">Crippling US Foreign Policy Draws Russia, China Closer Together</a>“.</p>

<p>And I don’t know if you have noticed, but U.S. relations with China have turned rather sour lately. Lots of accusations about spying and trade violations have been flying around, and just this week five Chinese warships were spotted <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/575230/chinese-warships-spotted-coast-alaska">off the coast of Alaska</a>. In the months ahead, expect our relationship with China to continue to unravel.</p>

<p>If China and Russia were to both fundamentally reject the U.S. dollar at some point, much of the rest of the world may choose to follow suit.</p>

<p>So why is that important?</p>

<p>The fact that most of the nations of the world use our dollars to trade with one another creates a tremendous amount of artificial demand for our currency. In other words, the U.S. dollar is valued much higher than it otherwise would be just because it is the de facto reserve currency of the planet.</p>

<p>As a result, we can import massive amounts of products at super cheap prices. When we go to Wal-Mart or the dollar store, we can fill up our carts with lots and lots of ridiculously inexpensive stuff. Our standard of living is way higher than it actually should be.</p>

<p>And because the U.S. dollar is used so widely in global trade, major exporting nations end up with giant piles of our currency which they have been willing to lend back to us at ultra-low interest rates. This has made it possible to fund our massively bloated federal government and to go 18 trillion dollars in debt.</p>

<p>If the rest of the world stops using our dollars and stops playing our game, we will be in a tremendous amount of trouble. The cost of imported products would absolutely skyrocket and our standard of living would go way down.</p>

<p>In addition, the federal government (along with state and local governments) would have to pay much more to borrow money which would rapidly create a gigantic debt crisis.</p>

<p>So Russia knows where they could really hurt us. Most of the “power” that America currently projects around the world is based on having the de facto reserve currency of the planet. If you take our financial power away, we would be far, far less imposing on the global stage. Sadly, the truth is that the U.S. military is rapidly shrinking and has largely been defanged by the Obama administration.</p>

<p>A lot of people that will read this article will not understand this, but it is very, very important to keep an eye on this emerging Russian/Chinese alliance. I believe that it is going to play a critical role in world events during the years ahead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very intriguing. You mentioned the fact that Obama has sabatoged our military. Do you think that these events are staged? As in, we are moving towards a crisis(es) so great that the world will be forced into unification? If it is an authentic WWIII scenario then we are all doomed, in my opinion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah, all signs are currently pointing to russia/china teaming up for war with the US.</p>

<p>sensational? totally. but the chinese could be manipulating the market to destroy the us dollar, and russia could be doing their part to weaken it. what happens after that?</p>

<p>russia parks a couple nuke subs off the coastal US, detonates a bunch of nukes 20mi above the US, creating EMP&#39;s across the nation, no communication/utilities/money/food/water...then they wait six months while the country tears itself apart, then march right in while we&#39;re busy killing each other.</p>

<p>all of this seems like a perfect storm, and perfect timing.</p>

<p>sorry, i&#39;ll be over in the corner with my tin foil hat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If that&#39;s the case, do you see it actually happening like you just said? With an EMP or something like that? I&#39;ve just head these rumors for several years now and I&#39;m beginning to think it goes deeper; Russia and China may be our enemies but they are not the most clear and present danger; we are. I do not see them pulling one over us without &quot;us&quot; allowing them to do it to a certain extent. Think about it; fast forward 2 years, Europe hates us cause of the tension with Russia and economic collapse(s) and the rest of the world doesn&#39;t want to go along with our Ponzi scheme anymore.. Someone like Putin leads the charge for a UN invasion of the United States, prepared for by Barak Obama. I just don&#39;t see it happening right NOW, and without TPTB having prepared for it. I have no doubt that that IS the goal; to wipe out the patriots i.e. the people with guns. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i don&#39;t know if i believe that it&#39;s THAT deep, but some of your points are definitely valid.</p>

<p>i simply believe that the rest of the world is sick of our bullshit, and that russia and china together is not a far-out scenario.</p>

<p>the market chaos happening, and 5 chinese warships parked off the alaskan coast combined with the russian research ship parked next to them give me considerable concern, given the timing of everything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, I didn&#39;t know that about Mormons. What an interesting bunch. Yeah so I spent a little over 100$ so far, and bought some really obvious necessities in case of any emergency, whether natural disaster or something caused by humanity. However, I quickly realized I would probably be dead with 2 weeks after some sort of societal collapse, above all, because I take a medication everyday that my life, in some sort of catastrophic situation like this, would cease to be. Besides alcohol, it&#39;s the only other drug in the world that you can die from the withdrawals, even in the safety of a hospital. So I stored about 15 of them in case, and put them in the first aid box. I will continue saving them from now on, in case anything happens. That way, if shit goes down, I can ween myself off without dying a miserable and painful death. I also bought a first aid kit, matches, a survival tool, flares, a poncho, water, a crowbar, and some other small tools. Thanks again <sup>^</sup></p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make a lot of good points but i find your missing a few. Firstly Russia and China are considered emerging growth markets ( along with Brazil and India). China seems like they are selling off US treasuries at a quickening pace but the reality is that they only got rid of 7% of their share to ease their economy. Since june 2014 to june 2015 they have actually bought 3 billion worth of Treasuries. China also has the problem that they are handcuffed to the US economy not only via treasuries (that are pretty liquid) but 25% of their economy/manufacturing base is export based and a lion share comes here. The UAE, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Nato Countries and South America aren&#39;t on board with this currency exchange and Japan (the #2 holder of U.S Treasuries) are at tensions with China over island rights the U.S has plenty of buyers out there. 
Additionally a weak dollar does have its drawbacks that you mentioned but it&#39;s not all doom and gloom. currently Manufacturing in the US is on par with China when it comes to cost of setup. a weaker dollar makes a better GDP due to increased exports for our goods just ask Mcdonald&#39;s and Procter and Gamble.
If and this is a big If China and Russia do ditch the dollar what currency has the liquidity, value, and sheer volume to take its place?  Dont even get me started with the military spending, that has been at a glut for the last 30 year and we out spend every developed nation combined with more unaccounted for plus thats a Congress issue...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, this would be stupid on Putin&#39;s part.</p>

<p>I was in Russia 3 weeks ago. The ruble is worth nothing. All the stores and businesses, they <em>want</em> US dollars, as it is much more stable, and won&#39;t be worth half what it was 6 months down the line.</p>

<p>If Putin passes a law like the one he&#39;s talking about, that would destroy the Russian economy even worse than it is right now.</p>
