    <div class="md"><p>Are you kidding? It&#39;s wise to expect negative feedback when you state such a wildly off base and very strange opinion. Abby Martin brings to light the things main stream media does not want us to see. Abby is a caring, passionate person. She brings to light the things that are wrong with this Country in the hope that awareness will help lead to change. The people who say things like you did, that she wants us to burn; are apparently those who feel it&#39;s better to be sheltered from the truth, and told everything is ok, just ignore the institutionalized torture, it&#39;s ok, USA, USA. This type of denial allows things to get worse instead of better. In a world where our media is so prewritten corporate fake; Abby Martin is as genuine as it gets. You don&#39;t need to wonder where Abby stands on a subject. She&#39;s honest and straight forward, has uncommon integrity as witnessed when she called out her former employer, when she didn&#39;t agree with what was happening in the Ukraine. Abby is highly intelligent and when combined with her passion and courage; she is one of the best journalists of our time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This guy is obsessed with Abby Martin... maybe in an unhealthy way... he posted a video tribute to her a few days ago (check his history if you wanna see the video) and I jokingly responded to the video by saying &quot;wow.. you are going to kill her one day aren&#39;t you?&quot; and got this in reply:</p>

<p>An ignorant statement which brings to focus the backwards world we now live in.

    <div class="md"><p>Because the video seemed similar to a video an obsessed fan/stalker would make and those sorts of stalkers sometimes end up trying to murder the object of their obsession.  Even talking about caring for somebody and dying for somebody you don&#39;t personally know is kinda weird.  I&#39;m sure you&#39;re a good guy and all but that stuff comes across in a creepy sorta way...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, how many obsessed stalkers do you know? What, do you run a car service for them? You don&#39;t know the details, of how I came to care about Abby. Super cliff notes: I respect her. In may she was bombarded with Rape/death threats. I chimed in because I respect her and I&#39;m a man of Honor. Psycho release her home address (and her mom&#39;s) on sniper forums. My defense grew more vigorous and I realized she was in my heart. I didn&#39;t suddenly loose sanity, just because I care about her, and I don&#39;t appreciate someone speaking about a tribute video I made for her first solo Art show, like it&#39;s a nightmarishly bad thing instead of the tribute it was meant to be. I didn&#39;t plan on caring about Abby, but here I am. As a man of Honor you have no idea how offensive your original &quot;joke&quot; was to me </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude the way you are talking about her is kinda nuts... You have intense emotional feelings for a person you never met.. This is Mark David Chapman shit.  He worshipped John Lennon and idolized him and felt like he connected with him on a personal level but then Lennon said something that Chapman disagreed with and he was so emotionally invested in this fantasy connection he had with Lennon that he felt overwhelmed and betrayed by Lennon and decided to kill him...  That&#39;s what I meant when I joked that I think you might kill Abby Martin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reread the thread because you obviously are lost.  The user David_Grecco is obsessed with Abby Martin.  He private messaged you when you made this post about her. A couple of days ago he wrote this to me:  &quot;An ignorant statement which brings to focus the backwards world we now live in. Someone caring about someone is viewed as &quot;crazy&quot; yet people hating on each on the internet is all the rage. I may live in this upside down so called civilization but I refuse to adopt it&#39;s Honorless ways.

<p>According to Rolling Stone magazine, <strong>past shows investigated &quot;Monsanto, Nestle, the U.S. federal electoral system, the drone program, the NSA, Israel, Obama, and water fluoridation&quot;</strong>.[24]</p>

<p>Martin drew widespread media attention when <strong>she closed her show on March 3, 2014 with a minute-long statement condemning the Russian military intervention in Ukraine</strong>.[28][29] She appeared to be reading from a teleprompter, leading observers to conclude that her remarks were made with the consent of the show&#39;s producers.</p>

<p>IF Abby Martin wants anything &quot;to burn&quot; in the United States, then it is limited to the clearly corrupt system and the unaccountable criminals that perpetuate it.  I have yet to see anything that advocates anything beyond that.</p>
