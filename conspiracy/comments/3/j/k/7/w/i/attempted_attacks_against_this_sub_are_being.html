<p>We fight to keep this home. r/conspiracy is leaking into the mainstream and this is exactly what we need. We will see more attacks because this sub is getting more attention and waking people up.

<p>To runaway and find a &quot;secretive new home&quot; will only work to keep our work isolated from the mainstream and that is just what the people we are exposing would want.</p>

<p>Out of curiosity, why have you chosen to ignore rule breaking behaviour here?</p>

<p>Edit: For anyone wondering, I have contacted the modmail to ask for their justification. This justification was refused despite multiple attempts at reasoning with the moderators and I was told I was going to be reported for spamming the modmail (total of 4 replies sent from me) should I continue to press the issue.</p>

<p>Mods seem to not want to admit that this post is, in fact harassment.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not about the karma score it&#39;s about the behavior. Example: cryvape spent over month posting on this sub, frequenting it daily. He&#39;s made over 250 posts here and even his name is just a parody of flytape. That&#39;s <em>bizzare</em> when you consider half of those posts were just him talking about how awful this sub was. </p>

<p>Also Gimace, strange how he was on a posting spree yet the moment I posted a screenshot of his karma and linked to his snoopanoo he just immediately stopped posting. Same for the account that started the thread, mysteriously inactive. </p>

<p>Nice smear attempt though, trying to make it out like the admins are doing nothing and this sub is just &quot;out of control&quot;  like FPH and coontown. Man those kooky racists are so extreme, wanna keep reddit a safe space so we should ban it right? I like how almost your entire post history is just you trying to convince people shills don&#39;t exist,  as though this sub hasn&#39;t been repeatedly targeted in the past. </p>

<p>And I asked the mod for their explanation why the context allowed for this post to be kept up. I am not telling them to take the post down, I am asking them for an explanation as to why it was kept up.</p>

<p>I get it, you are very, very angry. But this post, at least on the surface, violates sub rules and the targeting of a user (especially one who is not a regular in this sub) might even be against reddit-wide rules. Even if the mods feel it is justified, I&#39;d still like to know their reasoning. I get that this makes you mad. Too bad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok here&#39;s the summary</p>

<p><a href="/u/Gimace">/u/Gimace</a> is a sock puppet account. It&#39;s really obvious, however what&#39;s different from the other shills is, just like <a href="/u/swinging_mallet">/u/swinging_mallet</a> did, he somehow has the ability to make an account with its karma starting at 9999.
I made a post with a screen shot to snoopsnoo with his account, which you can see here: <a href="https://www.anony.ws/image/DCLK">https://www.anony.ws/image/DCLK</a></p>

<p><a href="http://snoopsnoo.com/u/Gimace">http://snoopsnoo.com/u/Gimace</a></p>

<p>I then posted this in response to the ask reddit thread. My posts was immediately deleted and my account was shadowbanned, along with all it&#39;s other posts being deleted.</p>

Originally my post said </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Gimace do you mind explaining where your 10k karma came from?
Edit: And then he stopped posting!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All references to that post and screenshot were deleted. However they did not delete all of my posts, in fact posts where others responded to me were not delete. My guess is to make the cover up less obvious.
What has me so worried is that reddit is in on this, in which case there may well be nothing we can do but attempt to inform the community at large.</p>

<p>This was such a sloppy attack though. It&#39;s obvious he&#39;s a sock account, and his fake post has 3k upvotes and 4k comments in a submission that only has 1.5k upvotes and 99% of the people are talking about gaming subs in response to the question. I mean did the reddit top admins seriously think that not a single person would notice the discrepancy? I&#39;m not gonna lie, I&#39;m actually kind of disappointed that I&#39;m the only one that caught this, though on the other hand I never would have found the thread if other people hadn&#39;t linked to it, so I guess I just happened to be the last dominoe in line.</p>

<p><a href="/u/Gimace">/u/Gimace</a> started his account with 9999 karma points! <a href="/u/swinging_mallet">/u/swinging_mallet</a> is the only other user I&#39;ve ever encountered who was able to do this!

    <div class="md"><p>Just constructive criticism here.  Using acronyms like FPH disarms your title because some people will not get the reference and it makes you seem not very well spoken.  If you&#39;re trying to appeal to the largest audience as possible you need to spell it out and not assume others know what it means already.  Not just for this sub but for your entire life.</p>

<p>Fine, here&#39;s your why, which you ignored:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;depending on context
</code></pre>

<p>And I asked the mod for their explanation why the context allowed for this post to be kept up. I am not telling them to take the post down, I am asking them for an explanation as to why it was kept up.</p>

<p>I get it, you are very, very angry. But this post, at least on the surface, violates sub rules and the targeting of a user (especially one who is not a regular in this sub) might even be against reddit-wide rules. Even if the mods feel it is justified, I&#39;d still like to know their reasoning. I get that this makes you mad. Too bad.</p>
