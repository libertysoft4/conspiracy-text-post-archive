<p>Seriously. This is ridiculous.</p>

<p>How do we let admins know this stuff is going on? Reddit is becoming useless because so many mods are just censoring based on the candidate they like and dislike.</p>

<p>Please help.  I honestly dont know what to do here.</p>

<p>(yes R politic and r inthenews are good but of course they are hidden from 90% of reddit readers who have no idea what they see is being so censored in the main subreddits.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you have it filtered how would you have known the amount of fat hate posts that were on the front page? Also you need to change it to top not hot. Having a smaller userbase isn&#39;t that bad, we have a lot less shills. Our current top post has over 300 upvotes and is about the TPP, it is from our regular news section and doesn&#39;t get forced down to our conspiracy sub like it is on here. Notice that the ones under that 2 upvote thing have more upvotes? the top one is currently randomized from smaller subs to help them get more users as voat grows. The top post when you made your first post was actually this post <a href="https://voat.co/v/news/comments/481037">https://voat.co/v/news/comments/481037</a> clearly more than 2 upvotes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>okay that has to do with the conversation how? Edit: you are still missing what I said and not hitting top. Since there is a a smaller user base it doesn&#39;t take much for smaller subs to hit the &quot;hot&quot; portion of the front page. Your only complaints are there are to few people, and there are people that have different opinions as you. I think you will enjoy reddit much more. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> mod here hitching on the top comment because I think it jumps to conclusions way too quickly.</p>

<p>The jury already seems to be out. Generally, I&#39;d expect <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to check out the evidence for themselves, and compare the submissions to the actual rules rather than jumping on a bandwagon based on a partial truth.</p>

<hr/>

<p>The relatively new moderator who removed this seems to have left the wrong flair as far as I can tell: </p>

<p><strong>This article is out of date for <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>. It&#39;s from July 1st, and we require submissions to link to content published within the last 45 days.</strong></p>

<p>That line has to be drawn somewhere, and an absolutely immense volume of articles, and lots of new information about Hillary&#39;s emails have come to light since that article. As most news articles, it presents itself as current and <em>news</em>, so people who don&#39;t very carefully check publication dates often miss the historical context and think links to old pieces take into account all the developments that have happened afterwards.</p>

<p>Today is self-post Saturday in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, so you&#39;re free to contextualize older material in the current political landscape in your own text posts where you set the agenda yourself entirely. </p>

<hr/>

<p><a href="/r/news">/r/news</a>&#39; &quot;out of date&quot; rule is even stricter, I <em>guess</em> their article just got caught by their anti-political filter first. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, but while I understand your viewpoint... &quot;Politics&quot; is not confined to the last 45 days.  </p>

<p>Did you know that the boundaries of Iraq were created more than 45 days ago?  In fact, many people would argue that Iraq should have actually been 3 different countries divided among the people rather than the boundaries decided by the British that we see today.</p>

<p>Your argument of &quot;45 days&quot; is fool-hearted.  To understand where we are today, in political terms, takes a much deeper understanding and longer view than your &quot;45 day rule&quot; allows for.</p>

<p>Another &quot;for instance&quot;.... if someone were to argue that the &quot;national security state&quot; came into full effect in 1963, then you could censor that article based on your &quot;45 day&quot; rule and call it &quot;not recent politics&quot;... however the effects of that occurrence are in full force today.</p>

<p>Your limitations are self-serving.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yes <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> has been completely taken over by astroturfers for Hillary. All negative articles stay at zero for most of their existence, and are immediately brigaded and posted in by the same exact individuals. They all have the same basic attacks, logical fallacies, and they are completely predictable in terms of when and where they will post. They are seriously banking on the idea that Republicans have cried wolf too many times, which is absolutely true for that insane bunch, but now every genuine criticism is answered with the same response: &quot;BENGHAZI BENGHAZI&quot;, like they are performing an exorcism. And they all have the same exact response to calling them out when a couple users have spammed an entire thread with their lies and misinformation: &quot;Oh so everyone who disagrees is paid? Huh? huh?&quot;.</p>

<p>The largest irony is that they ALL try to diffuse competition and criticism by saying that reddit is in a bubble and doesn&#39;t affect reality. Yet it&#39;s worth it for the NSA to astroturf and manipulate the bubbles in online websites including and especially reddit? Worth it for Hillary and Trump to hire PR companies or however the hell it works? Hypocrites.</p>

<p>At the very least it seems their influence doesn&#39;t spread past <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>. The same articles in <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> and <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> seem to have comment sections from an alternate universe, and all the same astroturfers and their reasoning gets downvoted to the bottom where it belongs.</p>

<p>Scumbags the lot of them. Sold their dignity and their moral compasses so they can work to manipulate the electorate with lies, manipulation and misinformation, in order to control the outcome of an election of the most powerful and globally influential nation on Earth. Thus ensuring that the oligarchy controls for another 8 years. Scumbags.</p>

<p>Sometimes I feel like giving up on my fight against the paid shills and astroturf on reddit. Like it&#39;s really for nothing and I&#39;m just screaming at the wind. I see the shills say it, that this sub is a joke and the 9/11 truth movement is dead and we&#39;re all just wasting our time. But then I remember that somebody paid them to say that, that they were handed cold hard cash to convince me of this. I remember that the fight for truth means something. That for every shill I distrsct, for everyone that I catch, that its one less down vote on a thread about the wars. That every distraction I make is less time for them to talk about how great Hillary and Israel is, and more time futily attempting to silence me never realizing that the obsevers, those who never post but read alot, see how ridiculous amd broken their arguments. They see my posts, &quot;what is this crazy guy talking about?&quot; they click on the shilling account and they see how transparent it is. Then the get curious, what&#39;s this guys agenda, why does he have such a hardon for fighting people in this sub? Then they read the articles, they go outside amd observe things, they start paying just that little extra attention to the TV, reading between the lines, seeing things,waking up, slowly, oh so slowly, but they do. </p>

<p>And so yet I fight  </p>

<p>Unfortunately voat.co made the very poor decision to have moderators as well.</p>

<p>I am not going to spend a lot of time an effort for an alternative that has the same fundmental structural flaw that inevitably leads to censorship by individuals.   If you have a vote up and vote down system by users you dont need a moderation team.  There was never a problem on reddit before moderators. User voting handled the problems.</p>

<p>Your solution has a constantly rotating legislature made up of naive and inexperienced people creating laws, while still having powerful lobbyists telling them what to do.

    <div class="md"><p>I get your point.  But it&#39;s also an extreme idea.  It&#39;s not going to be acknowldged as a legitamate proposal in congress.  The foxes are gaurding the hen house and it&#39;s hard to convince those foxes to fire themselves.</p>

<p>Campaign and lobbying reform is an easier proposition because it relies on the influencers not the influenced.  It even gives politicians the abilty to hold themselves up as reformers of the system while still maintainting their position.</p>

<p>Sadly you could probably initiate the largest campaign ever to remove incumbents from office and they&#39;d stay right where they are.  People trust their personal politicians.  Politicians are very good at making people like them.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a better question. Why on all of the recent post of conspiracy people are pushing beanie sanders so hard in the comments? It&#39;s almost like they thought he would appeal to this audience. I&#39;m not calling conspiracy because it&#39;s natural for people to prop up their candidate, I get it. But they always get down voted so hard. Bernie sanders is hillary is jeb, and Donald Trump is something far worse.</p>

<p>Just post the article, do not include your wall of text commentary in the comments. You posted both articles, the same way, with the exact same body of text posted in the comments. The mods are going to see this as your opinion, your &quot;editorializing&quot; on the subject, and will see more chance for removal. </p>

<p>If you didn&#39;t have those comments I&#39;d be with you 100%, but i can see that, politics for example, would have seen it as editorializing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mostly lurk reddit now. I&#39;ve given up posting to the main subs at least. for exactly the same reason op.</p>

<p>Why would i even want to contribute to those subs? they are completely irrelevant to me now. I get my news, etc from the web.</p>

<p>I felt hurt for a long time but i learned to not give a fuck and now i feel much better about it. for me reddit started to die when the main subs were slowly compromised starting around 2013 or so. I believe that&#39;s when we started seeing the same mods in most of the defaults showing up. Besides I&#39;m hangin with the goats now, where we&#39;re free to say what we see fit. So none of this matters.</p>

<p>To be totally honest i should say that i couldn&#39;t post links to most of the main subs now anyway because I&#39;m shadowbanned from most of them. last week i was banned from r/offmychest too, because I posted a comment. just one comment to r/srssucks, one comment in a completely different sub got me banned from offmychest. a year ago i would have been upset over it but it doesn&#39;t matter to me anymore. I used to be proud of reddit, was quite vocal about it too. now I don&#39;t talk about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>serious question: what difference do reddit mods being shills make? reddit isn&#39;t going to influence the vote very heavily, and even if it did <em>what candidate could change the political dystopia of Us politics</em>? even if a chemtrail-believin, 911-truthin, bona fide conspiracy theorist got elected, what could they do against the political machinery: the lobbyists, the interest groups, the senate comittees, the congressional hearings, the three letter agencies, the four letter agencies, the devil worshippers and the televangelists praying for the apocalypse to happen?</p>

<p>i know it&#39;s important that our online spaces remain free of political bias where possible, and at least don&#39;t censor free speech. this is important. but why is it <em>particularly important</em> that it&#39;s Hillary&#39;s people shilling this particular forum, when it would be the same if it were Jeb Bush&#39;s or Donald Trump&#39;s or even whichever of the Paul dynasty of damp squibs is running for president this time? Whoever gets elected, it&#39;ll be the same paymasters, giving the same orders, to the same limp-wristed puppet president. Do you think there is any chance that the shadowy forces that can send tens of thousands of troops to war, test chemical and biological weapons on civilians and orchestrated multi-platform disinformation campains would allow anyone <em>but</em> a shill into power?</p>

<p>so my further question is, are these shills (which seem unnecessary) or are they zealots, fanatics? and what does this mean in terms of investing energy in fighting them?</p>
