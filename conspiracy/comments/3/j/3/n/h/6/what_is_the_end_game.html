    <div class="md"><p>Christianity teaches that Jesus is the perfect example of a universal standard of good. Lucifer is the universal standard of evil. Since Adam and Eve, created in God&#39;s image, decided to step out of thier innately born covenanent with God, they and their offspring became like Lucifer. The only way to get on the right side of the winnowing fork is to accept Christ&#39;s blood sacrifice for our ( decendents of Adam and Eve) innately born sin. Those who accept Christ as Lord get His perfect righteousness passed on to them and are born into the kingdom of Heaven even before they pass away from the earth. Does that make Christians perfect on eartch after they accept Christ? No, however, they have the Holy Spirit which is a seal of redemption and guides them to act in a way that is honoring to Christ while sojourning on earth. Aliens do exist and it is all of humanity. They are Christians and they are non-believers. Neither belong here on earth in the grand scheme of things. This place is a battlefield of the things unseen with the physical eye.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe it is a spiritual experience to have manifested as a human being, here on Earth. I do not know what to call them, for they have many names, but there are unseen forces that work together in beautiful synchronicity; for good? for evil? For what? I don&#39;t know. I think it&#39;s up to us to create the best version of Earth and the best version of humanity. Together, the evil ones work in tandem to deceive us and lead us astray. They can only do so for so long; for soon the veil will be lifted and what is unknown will become known. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve asked this question myself and I concluded that there must be something beyond us that is directing the show here. If we are all that there is in this area of the universe, then what a shitty way for some people to have taken over and ruled over the rest of us. All for nothing. That&#39;s why I think our existence here isn&#39;t for nothing. It&#39;s for something, but the something that keeps us here isn&#39;t concerned what we do among ourselves...so we see a kind of king-of-the-jungle battle happening, when in reality, we are only fighting to be king of the jungle within our own prison walls. As long as we don&#39;t mess up our reason for being here, they don&#39;t care that some of us are psychopathic assholes who make life hell for literally everyone else on this planet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s just people trying to rule the world through collectives. It&#39;ll never work, though. Never has. Where does a centrally controlled functioning system exist in nature? Even an ant colony or beehive is still composed of free individuals who participate willingly in their system.</p>

<p>Only god (time?) can create that. Perhaps in a million years humans will have evolved such that their individuality is of sufficiently low importance that capitulation to the needs of a large and impersonal collective is easy and natural.</p>

<p>At the moment, humans are geared to operate on the level of a small collective – a family, tribe, or small village. Bigger than that and it doesn&#39;t work.</p>

<p>The spirit of these gigantic cities and nations ruled by central powers is what wants us to conform and discard our individual needs for the sake of the efficiency of the state. But, deep down, people don&#39;t care. They&#39;re not wired that way. So the state has to try to fuse the satisfaction of individual needs with actions that further its own ends.</p>

<p>But, as I said, it can&#39;t work in this day and age. If, ultimately, serving the state is advantageous – leads to the individual becoming more manifest, having more progeny, etc. then perhaps in a million years we&#39;ll be the planet-wide ant colony. </p>

<p>But, actually I doubt this will happen. Humans are already too far down an evolutionary branch where individuality is key. You have to be somewhat mindless to unquestioningly support a collective, and ultimately the only reason to do that is if your survival depends on it. For ants, this is the case. The lone ant fails. Also, there are many models in nature other than the gigantic collective. There are lone wasps and hive wasps.</p>

<p>Anyway, before I ramble on too much, at present humanity is like a bad Voltron with limbs that keep punching itself in the face, jump off and run away while the overall body runs around trying to reattach them.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all very silly, and honestly your one mission for this lifetime in 2015 is to maintain your sense of individuality, keep chaos ascendent. Chaos and individuality are bound to win, so just jam up the machinations of the collectives as best you can. Support the underdog collectives while they fight the incumbents, then turn on them when they get too big. It&#39;s just a funny, mad war that&#39;s been raging since day dot. It&#39;s like a law of nature, or something.</p>

<p>For me, the only thing that really pisses me off, is when so many people believe the bullshit. Because, I can&#39;t stand hearing it, and I can&#39;t really like people who have that mindset, and I would like there to be more likeable people in the world.</p>
