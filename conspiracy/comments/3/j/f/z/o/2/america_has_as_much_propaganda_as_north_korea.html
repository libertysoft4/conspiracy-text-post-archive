        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>When you mention propaganda, many people think of corny posters featuring a hammer and sickle or crudely edited North Korean videos glorifying Kim Jung-Un. Most Americans believe they are too smart and that the USA is too free for propaganda to ever work here. This is a grave error. </p>

<p>I could begin by citing the endless documented cases of propaganda issued by the central government. Like how the Pentagon <a href="http://www.salon.com/2011/08/29/sirota_military_movies/">edits many Hollywood scripts</a> or how it is <a href="http://www.salon.com/2015/07/31/youre_watching_pentagon_propaganda_american_idol_ice_road_truckers_and_the_truth_about_your_favorite_shows/">deeply involved</a> with numerous reality television shows. I could also cite the <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/defense-department-paid-5-4-million-nfl-honor-troops/">$5.4 million of taxpayer money</a> the Department of Defense pays the NFL to spot light veterans and to show case soldiers on the field at half time. Of course, there&#39;s also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird">Operation Mockingbird</a>, in which over 3,000 journalists in every form of media covertly worked for and often published stories directly written by the CIA from the 1950s to the 1970s. Mockingbird continues to this day, by the way. German journalist Udo Ulfkotte <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udo_Ulfkotte#The_book_.22Bought_Journalists.22">blew the whistle in 2014</a> when he revealed that it was understood journalists would lose their jobs if they wrote anything against the West. </p>

<p>Many of the supposedly impartial &#39;experts&#39; you see on television are actually <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/20/us/20generals.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">working for the Pentagon</a>. And CNN now offers news segments that are <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2015/06/08/cnn-courageous-branded-content-studio/">literally paid for by corporations</a>. </p>

<p>So it is all documented, but that is not the point of this post. Rather, I&#39;d like to point out that everyone is biased depending on what country they grew up in. 50s era Soviet propaganda may look laughably obvious to you, but that&#39;s because you have the benefit of hind sight and are coming from a different cultural context. Some one who grew up on a different planet may very well think the United States is a totalitarian society with North Korean levels of propaganda. </p>

<p>And here&#39;s the biggest mind-fuck of all: the masses, to some extent, actually <em>want</em> propaganda. Of course they want to live in the best country and have everything be black-and-white. Thinking is hard and scary. So is going to war and being a man (so we watch football.) So is approaching women and getting them to like you (so we watch porn.) So is researching how your country actually works and coming to completely different conclusions than your friends and family (so we repeat what they say on television.) </p>

<p>Propaganda comes both from the top-down and bottom-up. The herd wants and demands distractions, and the ruling elite is happy to provide them. Living in the United States is more of a mind fuck than most people could ever imagine. </p>

<p>I really think this whole concept of &quot;Russian propaganda&quot; is a big psyop on us to condition us to reject any truth they tell us as... Russian propaganda. It gives us a ready explanation of why Russian news doesn&#39;t match our news -- <em>they</em> must be lying!</p>

<p>Exactly. Not saying Russia is perfect, but it&#39;s so simplistic to assume that every other country (besides our Western European allies) is weak enough to fall for propaganda, but of course we in the Land of the Free <em>never</em> would. It&#39;s funny because when you think about it, this is exactly the kind of attitude you would expect from a brainwashed populace. Hell, I&#39;ve read about North Koreans who legitimately love Kim Jung-Un. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is true, but I think we are going through a great awakening. More and more people are starting to question shit, even if it&#39;s on a small scale, they are questioning. More and more people are turning off mainstream news and getting news online from different sources. Confidence in the government is at an all time low as with LE. People are sick of the endless wars in the ME and on drugs. We really are seeing people wake up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post except the going to war and being a man part. As someone who studies martial arts and warrior philosophy daily I view going to war other then to defend your country from direct attack or to overthrow a tyrannical government is childish. The united states military are a bunch of children. They are soldiers not warriors. Spartacus and Crazy Horse are examples of warriors. The Roman legions and 7th Calvery they fought against were soldiers who just follow orders. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely agree. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t phrase that part well. I meant that many men fail to live up to the warrior archetype (doing any thing to protect one&#39;s family and values, embarking on a path of constant self-betterment, battling against Evil, being a true individual but also living for one&#39;s people etc.) because it involves discipline and hard work. Thus, they turn to simulations of this path (football, video games) in order to semi-satiate the drive towards manhood.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s my thought process to. I <em>hate</em> the term &#39;conspiracy theory.&#39; The vast majority of the stuff we talk about here is on the public record and comes up in the New York Times and other major publications. It&#39;s just a matter of being smart, open minded, and connecting the dots. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They didn&#39;t call Hollywood the dream machine because it didn&#39;t work. It worked on many levels: the system gave audiences false aspirations and conceptions of time, power, class, dissent, race, etc...It is one of the greatest accomplishments of the United States. How else could a fascist system have justified attacking another fascist system as happened in WWII in the name of freedom and had most of the population on board with the war? How else could a nation of economic slaves be cowed into believing that poor people, other races, and dissenters, to name but a few, were evil people who deserved their suppression?</p>

<p>I was thinking about this the other day. What does North Korea do that&#39;s so bad compared to USA? The answer is nothing.</p>

<p>Even if you think America is on its way to imprisoning <em>tens of thousands of people</em> in starvation camps, it&#39;s not quite there yet.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, America does have more people imprisoned than anywhere else, and that&#39;s awful. Yes, jails like Guatanamo and others are atrocious and everyone involved in them deserves to be punished.</p>

<p>But <em>most</em> American jails are not like Guatanamo, and prisons like Guatanamo don&#39;t hold that many people. Like, how many people do you imagine are jailed in black sites all told, in the entire time they&#39;ve been functioning? I&#39;ve seen estimates of 100 to 400, but let&#39;s assume it&#39;s more than that...say, 10,000. That&#39;s still awful, and it&#39;s atrocious. I don&#39;t mean to minimize that by any means, it&#39;s deeply wrong and atrocious. </p>

<p>In North Korea, in <em>one</em> of their numerous camps, in a single year, 27,000 people were starved to death. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I absolutely agree that places like Detroit and Chicago are awful, largely due to the American government and police. I agree that police brutality is awful.</p>

<p>But I don&#39;t think that America is deliberately attempting to kill their political opponents by sending them to Detroit. In Chicago, people aren&#39;t forced to do manual labor for 20 hours per day, seven days a week. No one in Ferguson has been so hungry they&#39;ve murdered their child and eaten their dead body raw because the government confiscated their food. Children aren&#39;t killed because their grandfather, whose name they didn&#39;t know and who they had never met, spoke against the government 30 years ago.</p>

<p>The American government does engage in some truly, truly awful things but not to the same extent. </p>

<p>Government surveillance, police brutality and CIA blacksites are terrible and indefensible.

    <div class="md"><p>You really seem to be moving the goalposts in this discussion a lot. When I answer you, you seem to switch to a different subject.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll agree that what&#39;s happening in Gaza is in many ways comparable, even if it&#39;s not identical, to what&#39;s happening in North Korea and other historical atrocities and genocides. </p>

<p>I&#39;d argue, though, that doing such things to your own citizens isn&#39;t <em>quite</em> the same thing as giving other countries money to behave in such a horrifying way. I&#39;d also argue that what happens in a war zone--no matter how unjustified the war, and no matter what crimes may be being committed-- are different than what happens during peacetime. Plus, America has political reasons to give money to Israel, even if that&#39;s not an excuse. There&#39;s no real reason to kill children outside of NK leadership&#39;s bizarre view of the descendants of &quot;traitors&quot; polluting the gene pool. </p>

<p>To me, this is like the difference between atrocities that went on during World War Two, and the atrocity of the Holocaust. Both awful, but not equivalent things. </p>
