        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We&#39;ve all seen the video where the BBC allegedly reports the collapse of WTC 7 before it happened. Many people here claim this was because of a slip-up by the media, and that they had foreknowledge of the collapse. Debunkers claim it was a misread of the script, which was supposed to mention that WTC 7 is in danger of the collapse. Every time I hear either of these two theories, I shake my head. Here&#39;s why they&#39;re both wrong:</p>

<p>The background video, shown behind Jane Standley, does clearly show WTC 7 still standing. What&#39;s really going on here is that <strong>the background footage is not live. It is a recording of footage taken before the collapse.</strong> This is how most news stations, at least in 2001, went about with live broadcasts. When a reporter starts broadcasting live, they&#39;re standing in front of a green screen which, for most broadcasts, displays recorded video. Such was the case in the BBC footage. </p>

<p>There are no time stamps on the background footage (which makes sense, because nobody wants that to block the full view), but using Occam&#39;s Razor, we can all safely assume that a British broadcasting channel would have as little to do with the false flag that is 9/11 as a waitress from the streets of Manhattan. And we can both agree it definitely wasn&#39;t a botched script, it certainly didn&#39;t sound like it to me at least.</p>

<p>I am posting this because I hate hearing this debate, and I hate hearing this video as proof of foreknowledge of the collapse. Instead it&#39;s diverting the attention to the real foreknowledge of the collapse, such as the eye witness testimonies that &quot;they were thinking about bringing it down&quot;, and firefighters saying that they think the building will come down.</p>

<p>This has been proven in a UK court of law to no longer be just an allegation, but accepted as an actual fact. The BBC were in court over this, in regard to TV license fee claim, and they LOST.</p>

<p>Wrong. What was your line? &quot;That&#39;s an utterly foolish claim. You should really be embarrassed.&quot;</p>

<p>This is a case which has been persistently <strong>lied</strong> about by some truthers. <a href="http://www.wscountytimes.co.uk/news/local/9-11-controversy-in-horsham-court-1-4829773">Here&#39;s what actually happened</a> The man trying to use that defense against paying his license fee, actually had it roundly rejected, wasn&#39;t even allowed to present any evidence to that end, and the judge &quot;found Rooke guilty, and imposed a six month conditional discharge with £200 legal costs.&quot; Sorry, who lost again? The BBC <strong>weren&#39;t even involved</strong>, never mind &quot;lost&quot;. That is a complete fabrication by the truther movement. </p>

<p>Your claim their report was &quot;accepted to be so in a court of law&quot; is utterly without merit or foundation. </p>

<p>[As often seen here, downvotes and no actual counter-argument offered. But the OP deleted their own post, so it&#39;s clear they know the truth!]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On February 12, 2005, the 28 story Windsor Tower in Madrid, Spain suffered the collapse of the upper 11 floors of the building. The tower had a reinforced concrete inner-core surrounded by a traditional webbed steel-frame outer-perimeter. Between floors 16 and 17 was a 7-foot thick, reinforced concrete transfer floor, designed to act as a bulkhead and to support the steel framework of the upper 11 stories. An office fire began on the 21st floor and after 5 hours, the concrete inner-core could no longer support the melting steel outer-framework. The upper 11 stories collapsed down to street level with remnants of the upper 3 floors collapsing down on to the transfer floor. No one was killed. The building was a composite steel-frame and steel-reinforced concrete design.[17]</p>

<p>On May 10, 1993, the 4 story Kader Toy Factory in Nakhon Pathom, Thailand collapsed after fire broke out on the first floor and spread throughout the complex. The factory was in full production at the time and all fire exits were locked. 188 people were killed and over 500 others were injured. The building was a steel-frame design.[11]</p>

<p>Weird how a steel building can collapse from an office fire, huh?</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windsor_Tower_%28Madrid%29">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windsor_Tower_%28Madrid%29</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Windsor Tower (Spanish: Torre Windsor) was built in 1979 in the financial center of Madrid, Spain. This office building was 106 m high and had 32 floors of which 29 were above ground level and 3 below, thus ranking it as the eighth tallest building in Madrid (and 23rd in Spain). It was gutted by a huge fire on February 12, 2005, and <strong>partially collapsed</strong>; <strong>it has since been demolished</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windsor_Tower_%28Madrid%29#/media/File:TorreWindsor1.JPG">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windsor_Tower_%28Madrid%29#/media/File:TorreWindsor1.JPG</a></p>

<p>Kader Toy Factory:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kader_Toy_Factory_fire">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kader_Toy_Factory_fire</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>The factory was poorly designed and built.</strong> Fire exits drawn in the building plans were not, in fact, constructed, and the existing external doors were locked. <strong>The building was reinforced with uninsulated steel girders which quickly weakened and collapsed when heated by the flames.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, you gave me a partially collapsed building, and a shitty made toy factory is Thailand. None of them fully collapsed and one of them was made so terribly, it wouldn&#39;t pass in the US. Nice work!</p>

Any bit of undamaged or slightly less damaged structure would present resistance causing the building to slowdown and fall in an uneven fashion.

<p>..that she&#39;s standing in front of a window.</p>

<p>How in the hell does a green screen projecting the skyline with a window in it rebut any of my statements? You don&#39;t have to be crazy to understand that unless Jane Standley interacts with it, the background could just be green screened. Broadcasting stations did it all the time. This is no different. It&#39;s the most logical scenario. And until you can prove me wrong, I&#39;ll assume that the event with the least amount of assumptions occurred. So far nobody has provided any evidence to the contrary.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>..that&#39;s why he didn&#39;t post a link to the video!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, exactly. You seem to have it all figured out don&#39;t you. I made a post on Reddit about the most likely answer to an unlikely event, then you come over here and accuse me of being.. What? It&#39;s like I&#39;m some bad guy in your little world that you have to bust. Sorry friend, we&#39;re on the same team. I&#39;m not sure how little of my post you read to not understand this. </p>

<p>Sometimes we need to face facts and concede where it&#39;s right to concede. If some random guy 12 years later can persuade a judge into not making him pay a licence fee, more power to him. Nothing about the court case proves me wrong though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2007/03/part_of_the_conspiracy_2.html">BBC&#39;s explanation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At 4.27pm, a BBC reporter, Greg Barrow, who is in New York, appears on our radio news channel, BBC Radio Five Live, and says: &quot;We are hearing reports from local media that another building may have caught light and is in danger of collapse.&quot; He then responds to a follow-up question by saying &quot;I&#39;m not sure if it has yet collapsed but the report we have is talking about Building 7.&quot;</p>

<p>At 4.53pm, on the same radio station, the programme&#39;s presenter, Fi Glover says &quot;25 minutes ago we had reports from Greg Barrow that another large building has collapsed just over an hour ago.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what appears to have happened is they misreported one of their own correspondents, and it snowballed from there. Just another one of the many, many false rumors which circulated on the day. What this actually indicates is that WTC 7 was badly enough damaged, that reports of its collapse were plausible enough to be passed on immediately, without cross-checking. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So the reality as that a plane was meant to hit WTC7 that day, but it got delayed in airport congestion, this meant that there was doubt over whether to still take down WTC7 or if people would get suspicious and work out it wouldn&#39;t have collapsed like that without a plane in it.  The BBC script was now inaccurate, but as soon as the BBC reported the collapse the message quickly go through to the grand planners to quickly demo WTC7 and hope nobody noticed.</p>
