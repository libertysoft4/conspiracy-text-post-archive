<p>On August 26, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murders_of_Alison_Parker_and_Adam_Ward">two people were killed</a> during a live television interview.</p>

<p>Key themes: race and guns.</p>

<p>The father of one of the victims, Andy Parker, can be seen immediately calling for gun regulation within 24 hours. </p>

<p>Andy Parker is also an actor, <a href="https://willyloman.wordpress.com/2015/08/31/andy-parker-as-inspector-javert-in-theaterworks-community-players-2013-production-of-les-miserables/">known for his role</a> as Inspector Javert in Les Misérables.</p>

<p>In Les Misérables, Javert is the &quot;bad&quot; guy, while &quot;Jean Valjean&quot; is the protaganist.</p>

<p>Three days after this event, on August 29, <a href="https://variety.com/2015/legit/news/les-miserables-actor-kyle-jean-baptiste-dead-dies-1201581402/">a young actor named Kyle Jean-Baptiste</a> plunged to his death from &quot;his mother&#39;s fire escape.&quot;</p>

<p>Jean-Baptiste was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Jean-Baptiste">youngest and first black actor</a> who played the role of <em>Jean Valjean in Les Misérables</em>.</p>

<p>&quot;Jean-Baptiste&quot; is French for John the Baptist. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_the_Baptist">John the Baptist</a> was famously beheaded, and the date associated with his beheading is August 29.</p>

<p>AFAIK, no explanation has been given as to how Kyle Jean-Baptiste managed to plunge to his death from a fire escape on August 29.</p>

<p>As for the novel, <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PGMoAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=the+merchant+of+killogue&amp;dq=the+merchant+of+killogue&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y">The Merchant of Killogue</a> was first released in 1894, and recently republished by Oxford in 2013.</p>

<p>Allegedly, the main character, <a href="https://www.gunandgame.com/threads/looks-like-virginia-tv-shooting-maybe-a-staged-hoax-by-paid-actors.181536/">Sylvester Flanagan</a>, is part of a plot to <em>kill three people to influence a vote</em>.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murders_of_Alison_Parker_and_Adam_Ward#Perpetrator">Vester Flanagan</a>, also an actor, was just the cause of the deaths of 3 people, and there seem to be further calls for certain legislation...</p>

<p>Are they following a script, à la <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futility,_or_the_Wreck_of_the_Titan">The Wreck of the Titan?</a></p>

<p>Jean-Baptiste dead on the day of the beheading of John the Baptiste?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>An explanation has been given about how Kyle Jean-Baptiste managed to plunge to his death from a fire escape.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Police say Jean-Baptiste fell from the fourth-floor fire escape of an apartment on Greene Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant early Saturday morning. According to the Times, he was sitting on the fire escape with a 23-year-old female friend—when he stood up, he accidentally slipped and fell backward to the street below. Broadway World says the fire escape was at his mother&#39;s apartment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Foreward: It&#39;s getting buried because it&#39;s a pile of garbage not worthy of discussion. Talk about loosely connected.</p>

<p>The Titanic sank because it hit an iceberg. How is that a conspiracy? I&#39;m aware of <em>Futility</em>: It is a coincidence, and further, the discrepancies outnumber the similarities. Even the author had gone on record stating &quot;I&#39;m just well-versed in maritime travel, and the problems encountered by Titanic weren&#39;t unique to the Titanic&quot; (paraphrasing, I&#39;m having trouble finding that quote). </p>

<p><em>Les Miserables</em> is one of the most over-done plays of all time. <em>I acted in it</em>, in high school. Am I now suspect? Further, Jean-Baptiste, the actor, was the <em>understudy</em>. Not the guy given the role. He ended up with the role for a few nights, as an understudy (one of a few, I&#39;m sure). Jean-Baptiste is also an <em>incredibly</em> common name, arguably as common as &quot;John&quot; or &quot;James&quot; or &quot;Mark&quot;. It <em>is</em> a Biblical name.</p>

<p>John the Baptist <em>was not beheaded on August 29</em>. First, the story of his being beheaded is mostly just that: A story about a spoiled brat daughter of Herod who demanded John&#39;s head on a platter as a birthday gift. Most historians agree that&#39;s just a story. Second, no one knows the exact date. None of the scriptures match up in this regard. August 29 is <em>not</em> the date given for his death, anywhere. </p>

<p>Now this is actually kind of an interesting coincidence, and I&#39;m incredibly surprised the author didn&#39;t bring it up: This is August 29th <em>of the Julian Calendar</em>, whereas we use the <em>Gregorian calendar</em> now. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beheading_of_St._John_the_Baptist#Feast_day">Julian August 29 translates to Gregorian <strong>September 11</strong>.</a>. But again: This is not the day marking his beheading, but rather the <em>translation of the relic</em>, a celebratory feast honoring the day that the remains of John the Baptist were moved from the location they were found to a new location (The  Basilica of San Silvestro in Capite, Rome). Now it&#39;s somewhat intriguing that 9/11 pops up here, but that&#39;s really quite meaningless: The point is that there&#39;s no legitimate connection to Jean-Baptiste&#39;s fire-escape death as the author states.</p>

<p>And finally: <strong>The Virginia shooting was not a fucking false flag</strong>. No more than Sandy Hook or Aurora were. I cannot <em>evidence</em> this negative, as that&#39;s impossible, but look at the effect these events have had: They&#39;ve caused sadness, a bit of uproar, a <em>whole fuckload of speculations</em>... and no new gun laws.</p>

<p>For <strong>over twenty years</strong>, since the Oklahoma City bombing (likely beyond too), people have seen conspiracies in every tragedy that apparently was all laid out and meant to &quot;tik&#39; urr guns away!&quot; - That hasn&#39;t happened. Not even <em>close</em> to happening, in fact, gun regulations are more lax than they have been in the past few decades. People who are seeing false-flags in every single tragedy that makes the news are doing two incredibly huge disservices: First, they&#39;re not respecting the mourning period of those affected by these tragedies. That&#39;s just part of common human decency. Second, they&#39;re <em>only distracting from the real issues at play</em>: mental health care in this country is fucking <em>atrocious</em>: We use <em>prisons</em> to do it. That&#39;s just the relevant issue, the bigger issues are that the Neocons and the CIA have been waging wars with impunity for the past half-a-century, yet this author is distracted by the latest mental-health-deficient shooting, and trying to connect dots that are temporally <em>centuries apart</em> to evidence... well, what exactly? Has anyone put new legislation out there? Has anyone taken your guns? No. And it won&#39;t happen in America for the foreseeable future. This is Chicken Little screaming the sky is falling. </p>

<p>You let me know when the gub&#39;ment comes knocking at your door to take your guns. I&#39;ll just sit here and patiently wait while cleaning my AR15. </p>

<p>That&#39;s irrelevant, if true. The point of this speculation is that certain &quot;scripts&quot; are followed when creating these allegedly staged events.</p>

<p>The authors have nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>The Titanic sank because it hit an iceberg.</p>

<p>There are those who disagree. Anyway, now is not the time and place for <em>that</em> conversation, we&#39;ll save that for another thread!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Les Miserables is one of the most over-done plays of all time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I disagree, it&#39;s not &quot;over&quot; done. It&#39;s really, really good, and the music is phenomenal, so it rightfully is very popular.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jean-Baptiste, the actor, was the understudy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So? He was the first african-american actor ever cast for the role, <em>and</em> the youngest.</p>

<p>His death was <em>widely</em> reported. <em>They</em> choose the news, and they choose it for a reason.</p>

<p>If he was such a nobody, why was his death so widely reported?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>John the Baptist was not beheaded on August 29.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Read what I wrote, and read it carefully. I didn&#39;t claim that. I said the date <em>associated</em> with his beheading, <em>not his actual beheading</em>. Reading comprehension 101.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is August 29th of the Julian Calendar, whereas we use the Gregorian calendar now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, you&#39;re missing the entire point of this speculation.</p>

<p>Consider that these events are staged for ritualistic (or whatever) reasons. It doesn&#39;t <em>matter</em> what August 29th <em>used</em> to be in whatever calendar.</p>

<p>What matters is how we observe things now. They <em>want</em> to leave signs (again, <em>allegedly!</em>), and they <em>want</em> people to notice them.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t some cosmic conspiracy that goes back thousands of years.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And finally: The Virginia shooting was not a fucking false flag. No more than Sandy Hook or Aurora were.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re entitled to that opinion.</p>

<p>I think the jury is still out on all 3 of those particular events. I&#39;m certainly waiting until I gather as much information as I can before making up my mind.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>meant to &quot;tik&#39; urr guns away!&quot; - That hasn&#39;t happened.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think that&#39;s just one of many goals, but not the ultimate goal.</p>

<p>I think the main goal is to keep the population in a perpetual state of fear and cognitive dissonance.</p>

<p>The aware people see through these events, but are (mostly) powerless to do anything about it. </p>

<p>The less aware <em>know</em> something is off, and it affects them on a subconscious level. </p>

<p>Either they shut down, or they rabidly defend the false narrative, merely because it&#39;s &quot;officially&quot; sanctioned.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>What <em>is</em> relevant then is how the Titanic was a conspiracy or a &#39;staged event&#39;. That&#39;s the thing right? <em>Futility</em> served as the &#39;script&#39; for Titanic? So that&#39;s a <em>huge</em> assertion to say that the Titanic was a staged event, I&#39;m gonna have to ask for evidence. You&#39;ve shied away from this question twice now. Let&#39;s not leave this for another day, because I think it&#39;s a very important part of your allegation: it serves to set a base-point for the assumption that fictional stories are used as &#39;scripts&#39; these &quot;staged events&quot;. </p>

<p><em>Les Miserables</em> may not be overdone, but again, you&#39;re dodging the issue: You&#39;re asserting that acting in that play is somehow &#39;oddly coincidental&#39;, and I&#39;ve shown that it&#39;s absolutely not: There are a thousand people out there who&#39;ve played Jean Valjean. Ten, twenty thousand, maybe more. Why is this one special?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So? He was the first african-american actor ever cast for the role, and the youngest.</p>

<p>His death was widely reported. They choose the news, and they choose it for a reason.</p>

<p>If he was such a nobody, why was his death so widely reported?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;ve answered your own question in the first here: He was the first black Jean Valjean and the youngest. And he died. Tragedy sells news papers. Simple as that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Consider that these events are staged for ritualistic (or whatever) reasons.
...</p>

<p>What matters is how we observe things now. They want to leave signs (again, allegedly!), and they want people to notice them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Show me any evidence at all of this. You even qualify it yourself, &quot;again, allegedly!&quot;. You&#39;re putting it out there and then backing away from proving it. You can&#39;t just point to the coincidence that events happen to sometimes fall on the same day of the month over the years. There are only 366 unique Month/Day combinations, and millions and millions of events: Sometimes they&#39;ll fall on the same day. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think that&#39;s just one of many goals, but not the ultimate goal.
I think the main goal is to keep the population in a perpetual state of fear and cognitive dissonance.</p>

<p>The aware people see through these events, but are (mostly) powerless to do anything about it.</p>

<p>The less aware know something is off, and it affects them on a subconscious level.</p>

<p>Either they shut down, or they rabidly defend the false narrative, merely because it&#39;s &quot;officially&quot; sanctioned.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is you saying A) &quot;I&#39;m more aware than most&quot; which is just holding yourself up above all us &#39;unwashed masses&#39;, and B) &quot;you&#39;re just affected by it sub-consciously and you don&#39;t know it&quot;. This is <em>very nearly a personal insult</em>, Axol, as <em>I&#39;m</em> defending the official narrative, not because it <em>is</em> official, but because it makes more sense and requires fewer assumptions than the conspiratorial narrative. Don&#39;t pretend that just because I don&#39;t agree that I&#39;m &#39;in on it&#39; or &#39;bought into it&#39;. That&#39;s not rationality, that&#39;s tin-foil talking. </p>

<p>The fact is that <em>shootings happen every day</em>. Worse than this even. The thing that made this news was it happened <em>on TV</em>. That&#39;s a big deal. But no one goes about calling the abusive husband who kills his wife a &#39;ritualistic murder to keep the people in a perpetual state of cognitive dissonance&#39;. To me, this feels like projecting: I think <em>you</em> suffer from cognitive dissonance, and <em>you&#39;re</em> rabidly defending your narrative to avoid the discomfort. That&#39;s just as likely to me as your supposition, and likely just as offensive to you as yours is to my sensibilities. </p>

<p>But again: This is <strong>not the day marking his beheading, but rather the translation of the relic</strong>, a celebratory feast honoring the day that the remains of John the Baptist were moved from the location they were found to a new location (The Basilica of San Silvestro in Capite, Rome).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you&#39;re going to be looking into the ritualistic nature of these events, it&#39;s best to understand the rituals you&#39;re talking about. </p>

<p>Regarding those &#39;ritualistic events&#39;, I think that&#39;s delusions of grandeur – &quot;I&#39;m privy to this knowledge that so many are not&quot; – and further just a bit of fear mongery. </p>

<p>But you&#39;re not trying to convince me, and I certainly <em>could never</em> convince you: These allegations require zero evidence at all, so what could I possibly provide to show them to be absurd?

    <div class="md"><p>You <em>are</em> claiming to be special in this regard: If all these events are all just rituals, then surely that would be more widely known and accepted, right? But it&#39;s not. You&#39;re a minority, with regard to your belief there. You <em>believe</em> you are more aware than the average every-day Joe. That&#39;s what I&#39;m talking about when I say &#39;delusions of grandeur&#39;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting speculation, I agree, but so too is Star Wars and Jurassic Park interesting and speculative. Just because a thing is interesting doesn&#39;t make it non-fiction or factual or historically accurate, nor does it mean that speculation of future events is guaranteed to come-to-pass. </p>

<p>You cannot judge events in a vacuum and only let in the relevant points you want to. That&#39;s what is going on when this association with a Catholic holiday (or Jewish holiday re: the Shemitah thing), or any religious holiday is made with some modern day tragedy: You&#39;re not looking at the whole of history, you&#39;re only looking at the bits which you can string together to fit the <em>pre-defined narrative</em> that states there&#39;s a global conspiracy going on to commit atrocities-as-ritual in the name of appeasing Mesopotamian gods. </p>

<p>I mean you guys realize that you&#39;re essentially arguing that &quot;real magic exists&quot;, right? In 2015 no less. It really is unbelievable to me that people still think that way in developed and advanced industrialized societies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The occult <em>is real</em>: It really exists, as much as Christianity or Scientology. Doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s <em>legitimate truth</em> though. </p>

<p>I&#39;m glad you can at least admit your beliefs so candidly. You can believe all that as much as you like: As soon as you start implying that people have committed crimes, then I want evidence. I don&#39;t want someone accusing me of murder behind my back and without evidence: I don&#39;t think it&#39;s right to do that to others. I actually believe in the Golden Rule, and follow it as best I can. </p>

<p>Regarding <a href="http://www.thelemapedia.org/index.php/Magick">Magick...</a> &quot;Any act which is intended to cause change&quot;. Sure, I believe that exists too. It&#39;s called politics and debate. That&#39;s not supernatural at all, even by the most ardent of Thelemists:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Magick is not capable of producing &quot;miracles&quot; or violating the physical laws of the universe (i.e. it cannot cause a solar eclipse), although &quot;it is theoretically possible to cause in any object any change of which that object is capable by nature&quot; (Book 4)</p>

<p>Well thanks for clarifying. I guess I can add hyperbole to the list of things wrong with your statement. </p>

<p>By all means: You show me the evidence that it was a false flag, we&#39;ll put it all in an organized format, together, and then we&#39;ll file charges against the guilty parties. I&#39;ve got an attorney with ambition: He&#39;d love to take this. But we can use your attorney if you&#39;d rather. </p>

<p>We&#39;ll take it to court, and get it all out in the open. Right? We&#39;re talking about a crime committed by the government that resulted in two people dead on live television: Certainly if we can evidence that, we&#39;d want to put the guilty parties in jail, <em>right?</em> </p>

<p>That&#39;s the <em>point</em> of discussing conspiracy: To bring the guilty to justice, is it not?</p>

<p>Or.. isn&#39;t the evidence concrete enough for that? It&#39;s <em>not</em>, is it? </p>

<p>Can you admit that? Because the fact is that these are all opinions; your allegation that it was a false flag is just as much an opinion as my denial that it was. The difference is that I&#39;m not alleging anything other than the story we saw happen on TV: You&#39;re the one spinning wild tales out of it all, so the burden of proof lies on you: The one alleging the story we saw wasn&#39;t true. So prove it. </p>

<p>You say you&#39;ve got heaps of evidence. I want to see it. Heaps of it. I want to see you put it all down in writing. Take the time to do it. Or is that not high on your list of priorities today? If not, why? Again: You claim to have &quot;<em>heaps of evidence</em>&quot; that entities within the government are killing civilians on TV to further hidden agendas - that is <em>huge</em>. That&#39;s breaking news, worldwide, and absolutely would result in a summary execution for treason, let alone a triple-murder. </p>

<hr/>

<p>I wrote all that with a tongue in cheek to prove a point; You <em>don&#39;t have that evidence</em>. If you did, you&#39;d be sitting on again, a huge story and doing nothing, which we know is patently evil: &quot;Good men who fail to act&quot; and all that. </p>

<p>No, what&#39;s really happening is you&#39;ve got an interest in intrigue and spy stories and insidious plots. Who doesn&#39;t? It all makes great fiction. You want to support your theories because you are entertained by them, but the fact is, you won&#39;t put the effort forward to actually <em>do anything about them</em>. You don&#39;t honestly <em>believe in them</em> hard enough to follow through and chase the bad guy. Think you do? <em>Prove it</em>. Take some action other than commenting on a fucking internet forum. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>John the Baptist was killed because he criticized the union of Herod to Herodius. Herodius had been married to and divorced Herod&#39;s brother, making the marriage between her and Herod invalid. John the Baptist was beheaded for his defense of traditional marriage. </p>

<p>In October the Pope has convened a synod to discuss &quot;The Family&quot; and to see what can be done for the divorced and remarried. Many catholics are concerned that they will weaken the Church&#39;s teaching and allow divorced and remarried Catholics to receive the Eucharist and in essence making John the Baptist&#39;s death be in vain. </p>

<p>(Speaking of &quot;The Family&quot;, Julian Assange is in the news, and he grew up in a cult called, The Family.</p>

<p>EDIT--Allegedly, the main character, Sylvester Flanagan, is part of a plot to kill three people to influence a vote.--</p>

<p>Maybe the vote that needs to be influenced is the vote on the Synod, not gun control.</p>

<p>Well when you make a post that gets downvoted heavily, it may be that you&#39;ve touched a nerve somewhere. But when you make 10 posts a day and they all get downvoted, maybe it&#39;s more likely the quality of your posts that&#39;s leading to the downvotes.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m referring to the larger occult plan. And question things all you like, but don&#39;t confuse terms: &quot;Questioning&quot; is not what&#39;s going on, not in the sincere sense of the word. </p>

<p>Ever watch Ancient Aliens? Oh, of course you have: The guy who started it all, Erich von Daniken, has gone on record time and time again saying &quot;I&#39;m just asking questions&quot;. </p>

<p>Do you honestly believe that von Daniken has, throughout 7 or 8 seasons and decades of authoring books, sincerely &#39;just been asking questions&#39;? No. He&#39;s been pushing his narrative as possible truth. It&#39;s not &#39;just asking questions&#39;, it&#39;s Jeopardy: <em>Putting the desired answer in the form of a question.</em> </p>

<p>For example, I could say &quot;I think Bernie Sanders would be an excellent choice for President&quot; (fact, I do think that). </p>

<p>I could also say &quot;Do you think Bernie Sanders would make an excellent choice for President?&quot;. This is a disingenuous question: I supplied the desired answer right there. The sincere question would be worded as &quot;What do you think about Bernie Sanders bid for the presidency?&quot;. That&#39;s a sincere question, open and welcoming to the most positive or negative responses, and all in between. </p>

<p>This practice is not only well-known, it&#39;s well-known as a pre-emptive defensive tactic. It indicates the speaker is well aware that their answer is likely full of holes, and as such, if they put it in the form of a question, it&#39;ll be received better than to put it in the form of a direct assertion.</p>

<p>Frankly I don&#39;t see people &#39;just asking questions&#39; on this subreddit very often at all. I see people asserting answers to implied questions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Edit: Our conversations have converged; let&#39;s just keep it to one thread.</p>

<p>I absolutely don&#39;t deny that: We&#39;re discussing criminal events within the context of a government and a country of people - these are all things governed – <em>objectively</em>, meaning applying to all (yourself included) – by secular morality. </p>

<p>Basically, what I&#39;ve been getting at this whole time is simple: If you don&#39;t believe in all the magic and &#39;ritual power&#39;, then you have absolutely no reason to believe any of this. </p>

<p>If you do believe in all that, the fact is you can say anything you want about it and rationalize it with your subjective spiritual interpretation: no one&#39;s spirituality is more correct than the next, definitively. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know what <em>evangelical christians</em> say about the absence of evidence: &quot;The absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.&quot; </p>

<p>That&#39;s not itself evidencing anything but a predilection for wordplay, which evangelists of all stripes, by and large, have a predilection for. </p>

<p>I find <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_of_absence#Proving_a_negative">Steven Hales&#39; thoughts on the issue</a> quite relevant:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Philosopher Steven Hales argues that typically one can logically be as confident with the negation of an affirmation. <strong>Hales says that if one&#39;s standards of certainty leads them to say &quot;there is never &#39;proof&#39; of non-existence&quot;, then they must also say that &quot;there is never &#39;proof&#39; of existence either&quot;.</strong> Hales argues that there are many cases where we may be able to prove something does not exist with as much certainty as proving something does exist.</p>

<p>Wow. </p>

<p>Talk about silencing dissent. </p>

<p>Talk about privacy breaches. &quot;track the identities of the infanticidal shills&quot;. I know I&#39;m one of those as far as you&#39;re concerned; you&#39;ve implied heavily I am a shill in this very thread. </p>
