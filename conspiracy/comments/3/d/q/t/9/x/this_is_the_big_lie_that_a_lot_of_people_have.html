<p>All truth goes through three stages first it&#39;s ridiculed, then it&#39;s violently opposed and lastly it&#39;s accepted as self evident.</p>

<p>The truth is the earth is flat, there&#39;s no antarctica and instead there is giant ice wall around the perimeter of the earth. Also the sky is not what it seems, there are no satellites, there are no planets in fact there is no space! There is simply the firmament, a glass ceiling a few miles up. What you see as stars are simply holes in the firmament, with the light from heaven shining through.</p>

<p>Think about this how can the earth be round when water doesn&#39;t curve. Water is self-leveling, how can you have a globe of 70% self-leveling water. Huge bodies of water such as Lake Taho and others have been proven to have no curvature, rivers that run thousands of miles such as the nile only drop a few feet over the whole distance.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t take my word for it start critically thinking and researching for your selves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wouldn&#39;t it be interesting if the US government decided to find some religious nuts out there through <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>? I bet it would be easy to find who you are looking for by promoting the most backwards dogmatic beliefs.</p>

<p>The zealots are always the easiest to manipulate.</p>

<p>So just a caution to you flat earthers. If you find yourself in a situation that seems like you are being recruited or maybe manipulated into giving out personal information RUN AWAY. </p>

<p>I&#39;m serious here. This is some dangerous shit you guys are playing with. Regardless of your religious views please try to remember that there&#39;s no holy war and you shouldn&#39;t be inclined to go kill folks to start your war.</p>

<p>The recent emergence of the topic goes far beyond reddit, there is a lot of other internet out there where it is being seen.  Also, it is not necessarily religious.  Much of the evidence being put forward is physical measurements and observations you can do yourself.  People who look at it from a religious point of view find things that match of with their scriptures, but not many people are only interested in things that are more concrete.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m an old man who personally has debunked the flat earth theory with mine own eyes. I&#39;ve worked in the aerospace industry for a long enough time to have had personal experience with the spheroid we live on. So don&#39;t try to pull the flat earth ignorance bullshit on me.</p>

<p>Saying this has nothing to do with religion either makes you ignorant or intentionally misleading. The flat earth theory has everything to do with religion. You are literally a blind follower if you throw yourself into that dark box. And being a blind follower has everything to do with religion.</p>

<p>That being said, my original statement still holds true. If I were running an operation to find some idiots dumb enough to shoot innocents I&#39;d look towards flat earthers and the like. You have to be a particularly exceptional type of stupid in order to subscribe to that thought process.</p>

<p>Hell man, I even allow myself to accept the possibility of aliens. But I&#39;m not going to disregard my own eyes just because some idiot says otherwise.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve spent quite a bit of time on this topic, never from a religious approach though as I&#39;ve never been involved in any organized religion.  The push on the subject lately does not appear to be naturally occurring, but I think there is something tangible to it.  The standard flat earth model does have some problems, but so does the official globe model.  It appears that we are being pushed into a false dialectic.  I think it is important to point out that proofs against the globe is not proof of the standard flat earth model and vice versa.  </p>

<p>I have no intention of lining up behind some leader on the topic.  The ideas presented I wish to evaluate myself.  </p>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m fairly certain aliens is a completely manufactured topic.  I spent a couple of months down that rabbit hole.  There is a huge amount of material there.  The reason to believe it is the size of the conspiracy required to fake it.  However after spending enough time on it, my opinion is that there has been a long term plan to fake it.  Many UFO sightings are likely human tech no publicly available.  Also I think it is used on MKULTRA victims as both a way to spread the myth and to discredit their victimization should they speak out.  Project Blue Beam is a possibility (<a href="http://educate-yourself.org/cn/projectbluebeam25jul05.shtml">http://educate-yourself.org/cn/projectbluebeam25jul05.shtml</a>).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is this video of Phil Schneider where he says he saw an alien with his own eyes and the alien shot at him and he lost his arm. I entertained the idea for a while, but came to the same conclusion as you. It looks like a manufactured topic, and that along with Area 51 make people who look into conspiracies look like kooks and removes any seriousness from the act of scrutinizing government&#39;s claims. In a democracy, we have to hold the government accountable and it is their duty to furnish proof. They are guilty until proven otherwise. But very few people realize that, that is how it should be.</p>

The descriptions on the attempts on his life and his killing after that presentation added to the &#39;authenticity&#39;.  But I&#39;ve since seen that faking opposition to authorities and faked deaths are standard tactics to increase credibility.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t take my word for it start critically thinking and researching for your selves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why don&#39;t you first present the tiniest bit of evidence?</p>

<p>The problem that I have found with the flat-earthers is that they seem to be completely incapable of conducting any real-world experiments. Instead, we are treated to an endless array of pointless &#39;thought experiments&#39; which supposedly indicate a flat, stationary earth.</p>

<p>Why don&#39;t they perform any experiments themselves?</p>

<p>Here are some simple ones - build yourself a Foucault Pendulum. I have heard countless FE loons tell me that all the pendulum installations around the world are rigged in some manner. But not a single one of these dunces have ever constructed their own pendulum and shown absence of processional movement. Why not? What are they afraid of?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s another test - the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E%C3%B6tv%C3%B6s_effect">Eötvös effect</a>. This basically states that there is a small centrifugal effect on gravity from the rotating earth. This has several predictions. First, it predicts that your perceived weight would be slightly higher (about 0.3%) at the poles compared to the equator. It also predicts that perceived gravity would be slightly different when traveling with the earth&#39;s rotation compared to traveling against it. This effect is predictable - the Wikipedia page has some equations based on the earth&#39;s angular velocity that will allow you to predict the strength of the Eötvös force.</p>

<p>So - why not simply get hold of a standard mass, say 1 Kg. Carefully measure it&#39;s weight at the equator. Then take the same mass to the North Pole and measure it there. There should be about a 3 gram difference. Or, measure its weight while traveling eastward at the equator, and then again while traveling westward. In each case, the change in perceived weight should match that predicted by the centrifugal force of the rotating earth.</p>

<p>An even simpler test is this: a spherical earth predicts that there will be 24 hours of sunlight at the summer solstice at the South Pole. The closer you get to the pole, the more days of complete sunlight you will experience. At about 66.5 degrees, you would experience at least one full day of sunlight at the summer solstice (December 21-22). </p>

<p>So - why not simply charter a ship to take you down to 66.5 degrees in late December, and see if there really is 24 hours of sunlight or not? This is literally the easiest test the the flat-earthers could do. In fact, there are any number of commercial cruises that offer exactly that. Why not take one of them, and see for yourselves? It&#39;s not that complicated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It comes from old woodcuts, showing the Earth enclosed in a hemisphere of the firmament with holes in it through which light shines.</p>

<p>In medieval times, God was considered to be outside the sphere of the fixed stars. God was omnipresent beyond the stars, and God was light. It&#39;s not a big stretch from this view of reality to assume that the stars are actually the light of God, shining through an opaque sphere that causes the darkness of night.</p>

<p>The Ptolemaic theory of the cosmos was somewhat different and more complex, but related to this view. In the Ptolemaic system, each planet was set in its own transparent, or crystaline sphere. The stars had their own sphere, also, but if you believe that God lies beyond the sphere of the stars, and that God is all light, it is not too great a jump of logic to assume that the sphere of the stars must be oqaque (otherwise the light of God would flood the Earth day and night), and if this sphere is opaque, it&#39;s not too big a jump to speculate that the stars are really just holes to let the light of God shine through.</p>
