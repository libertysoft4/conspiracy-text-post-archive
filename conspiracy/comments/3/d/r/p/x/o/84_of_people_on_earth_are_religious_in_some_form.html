<p>do you know who?</p>

<p>rich mother fuckers who have everything that is &quot;best&quot; in life while idiots go to various type of churches, work as bastards for practically nothing, yet they believe they will live another life where they will be happy.</p>

<p>this is the definition of insanity.</p>

<p>the fucking reality is that you are being fucked, get back to the ground don&#39;t believe in crazy angels with wings and shit. Some dude that maybe didn&#39;t even lived centuries ago had not found the manual of life.</p>

<p>Make the last step and be free, look at the crazy people around you and wake up.</p>

<p>the mother of all conspiracies is religion, in any shape and fucking form.</p>

<p>84% I&#39;ve just found that number online, where I&#39;m walking i still have to find one that doesn&#39;t believe in some form of supernatural imaginary crap. maybe is 99% then.</p>

<p>a lot of crazy people. fucking hell</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your religion is science? That religion for you is accepting whatever science tells you is right? How many experiments have you done personally, how many times have you tested things told to you as fact,  and finally how many times has your own science proved your own science wrong? There are constant contradictions and evolving theories on what is real and what isn&#39;t in science. You accept what is real and what is fake based off what you are told and believe, you have faith that it is right, you have not independently verified anything. Anyone can look around them and understand reality and things that actually occur time and time again, repeated experiments that do not vary, but most of what you consider science is actually just the best explanation we have at this singular point in time. Organized religion is a form of control. The only thing you need to find God is the new testament in the king james bible. You don&#39;t need someone telling you what do believe, you just need to go understand it for yourself, then you can start making your own view on what is real and not, what is right and what is wrong. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it is necessary to choose between an organized religion and being a person who accepts everything that official science dictates at face value.  I would say both are forms of cults.  Freedom is independence from both and the ability to use reason and rational thought to approach issues.</p>

<p>You state that organized religion is a form of control, which is certainly something I agree with, but why do you think that the new testament in the king james bible is truthful?  I must confess, I have never read it myself, so perhaps the words themselves are extremely profound.  But the origin of the book would be a problem for me.  How can you trust the intentions of the source absolutely?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe it is the best english translation we have. The words are meaningless in themselves, it is the teachings of the book that make it truly profound, it has taught me an amazing amount of great of a person jesus was. I never knew how much people pervert the teachings of Jesus to their own means. The basic teaching is love your neighbor like yourself and everything else will fall into place. It has so many more things to teach you though. If you pray and spend time to not read but understand the gospels you will be truly amazed at how God will impact your day to day life. I can&#39;t ever trust the intentions of the source absolutely because it was written by men, but I know all the teachings are truly great. I think it&#39;s very important to read each book of the new testament front to cover and understanding his teachings in context and full meaning, rather than your own preconceived notions. I am still well on my way to fully understanding it and am only 2months into my journey. I wish you the best of luck in whatever path you choose, but know that God is waiting for YOU with open arms. I am here if you ever want to talk or discuss anything! If it&#39;s about the bible or just daily life. God Bless You </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually the number of religious people is falling. Churches and other places of worship are losing members all the time. The younger generation is no longer adhering to the Establishment that is religion. Many young people are either atheist or spiritual (deist, agnostic, etc etc).

    <div class="md"><p>Biblical scripture even states Jesus and the apostles condemned churches, the Romans/Constantine were the masterminds behind sheepling people in following the church in a nasty occult like fashion. Before that, people devoted their faith and belief to God and he was their shepherd. They did gods willing, and as you could imagine the issues came when governments/states controlled churches and the occult is had and used it for its own political/geopolitical gain at that time. The Romans also used man tactics to get people to fear and believe in their church of lies, one of those ways was the inquisition. There is nothing wrong with belief and religion until a government or state, dynasty, royal family come and pollute the messages for their own benefit. The last thing you would want to see is the dissolving of the diverse world religions/beliefs/cultures because that would make it much easier for individuals to conquer all through let&#39;s say a New World Order. </p>

Better yet, a religion that holds people accountable for all their actions, words, behavior, and thoughts towards others and themselves as long as they have the mental capacity to and are still alive.</p>

<p>And to prevent lawlessness, poverty, and deterioration of society this religion has a set of logical rules for everyone to follow. A way of life that reminds you of your eventual death and impermanence.  Also, a system of welfare built into the religion would be a plus. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most people are insane in one way or another. If you observe what they do you can clearly see traces of schizophrenic behaviour and a whole spectre of different mental disorders. 
Take my parents for example. They&#39;re around 50 yrs old and poor as fuck. They had 50 years to work out a strategy to make enough money together but they didnt use it. I, on the other hand, have managed to accomplish 100 times more in only a few years, because I was actually doing something instead of complaining and being all negative about life.</p>

<p>From my perspective it&#39;s clear that about 90% of the human population are batshit insane, depressive and destructive. It&#39;s pretty obvious that people love to suffer and teach their kids to do the same. Most people are weak, pathetic and honestly I think they don&#39;t deserve anything but to die.</p>
