<p>We don&#39;t even need pictures from space to conclude that the Earth is round (which is why we knew that well before the camera was even invented).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i believe NASA misleads and lies to the pubic</p>

<p>So reference another space agency. Or the hundreds of videos on YouTube where people have sent up their own equipment. Or get a telescope.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We questioned the material and arrived at an answer. The problem is the Flat Earthers who wave away evidence of their misunderstandings and keeping spewing their ideology all over the place.</p>

<p>Education has indoctrinated the masses into such a state of conformist that anyone daring to question <em>science</em> is tarred and feathered by the masses.  I call bullshit on this religious zeal and yeah,  I looked into a lot of NASA-s stuff and find myself very stupid for ever having trusted them at all.</p>

<p>The trick is to stop it when the horizon is splitting the screen. That implies minimal distortion. Concave Earth confirmed!</p>

<p>Those are the Flat Earthers. They admit over and over that they don&#39;t have any college degrees of which to speak of, that they&#39;ve put a minimal amount of research into it, that they can&#39;t explain why gravity is wrong, just that it <em>feels</em> wrong, and on and on it goes.</p>

<p>Not only that, but it&#39;s being equated with &quot;uneducated&quot; and &quot;gullible&quot; because not enough people show up (or just get shouted down) when trolls start abusing places like here.

    <div class="md"><p>Thing is, we can use <em>math</em> and <em>physics</em> to prove that the Earth is round and orbits the sun - we <em>cannot</em> use math and physics to verify 9/11, Sandy Hook, etc. Those are a whole different ballgame! But you can&#39;t doubt science, because you can perform it yourself and prove that it works, which just isn&#39;t possible with theories about <em>events</em>. </p>

<p>As for the math, I mean college-level physics. Start with Newton&#39;s Laws, those alone are enough to understand that the Earth is spherical because of gravity, and you can do the math and perform the experiments to prove it at home! </p>

<p>I hope I explained how well enough in my other post. Please feel free to ask for more clarification if you need it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No worries. Having spent much of the past five months studying heliocentrism and geocentrism, the biggest lesson I have learned is just how little most people - even &#39;awake&#39; people - know about the &#39;universe&#39; they exist in. Ask somebody to explain to you why they believe we live on a spinning ball. In most cases they will rehash easily-debunked &#39;evidence&#39; like &#39;water down the drain&#39;, &#39;ships disappear over the curve&#39;, or &#39;sticks and shadows&#39;.</p>

<p>Whether one chooses to believe in ball earth or flat earth, the research is truly eye-opening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can learn the <a href="https://www.easycalculation.com/physics/classical-physics/newtons-law.php">gravitational equation</a>, aka Newton&#39;s Law of Gravity. </p>

<p>If you read into the Law of Gravity you&#39;ll discover that gravity causes things above a certain mass to become round! How neat! </p>

<p>Now combine this knowledge with an understanding of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlTVIMOix3I">why gravity makes things fall</a>, and you will begin to understand how bleedingly obvious it is that the Earth is round, and orbits the Sun (according to the frame of reference that includes Earth and the Sun). </p>

<p>Ooops, did I say <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference">frame of reference</a>? Now we&#39;re getting into general relativity, that might be going a bit too far! :) </p>

<p>If you&#39;ve like to verify for yourself the gravitational equation, you can!!! In fact, <a href="http://www.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.mfe.lp_gravity/gravity-and-falling-objects/">grade school children can do simple measurements that proves the Law of Gravity</a>! You can get a <a href="http://www.pstcc.edu/departments/natural_behavioral_sciences/Web%20Physics/Experiment%2004web.htm">bit more complicated</a> and learn to use a pendulum to measure &#39;g&#39; directly, if you want a college-level understanding. </p>

<p>Hope this helps! </p>

<p>How so? Give me your suggested internal volume and I&#39;ll show you how dense the remainder of the earth&#39;s core would have to be.

<p>In a concave hollow earth gravity doesn&#39;t pull, it&#39;s a push.  The math has been inverted, it works.  Like said I don&#39;t beleive the theory, but it&#39;s amusing because it is mathmatically sound, you&#39;re not going to disredit it by dropping a shoe, you&#39;ll only defeat your own misconception of what the theory is.</p>

<p>No, it isn&#39;t; and no, it doesn&#39;t. You only think it works because of your ignorance. This &quot;theory&quot; completely undoes atomic nucleation, <em>which is really kind of important!</em> </p>

Because gravity is just a consensus agreement on how to describe phenomena it itself does not exist regardless of the description being used.

<p>NASA thinks you are wrong.</p>

<p><strong>Thus the universe was known to be flat to within about 15% accuracy prior to the WMAP results. WMAP has confirmed this result with very high accuracy and precision. We now know (as of 2013) that the universe is flat with only a 0.4% margin of error.</strong></p>

<p>So space is 3 dimensional because space is 3 dimensional? That&#39;s great logic Sherlock. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the earth is a disk there must be an edge to it. How is it a red herring? .</p>

<p>What about people sttempting to get into restricted airspace. Dont tell me no one has tried. People try everything. Remember thatbguy who ran into the White house across the lawn? </p>

<p>Edit: as for altitude? Its measured as the distance above sea level... which doesnt really change. Maintaining a steady altitude will be fine. You will  not fly out of the atmosphere. Also, a plane does not posess the power to break out of earths gravitational pull. It will stall when it gets too high for the engines to operate,  then come crashing back down. Planes rely on principles of air to give them lift, sfter a certain altitude the air will not be thick enough for most planes, except ones specifically designed for flight at that level. Please... go to a class and learn a little bit of physics and general science before you start making outrageous claims. You are making yourself look not insane, but completely ignorant and unwilling to accept fact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lmao, a link from the flat earth society. You didn&#39;t even read the real account, apparently. But, ok:</p>

<p>&quot;In 1870, a Flat-Earth proponent named John Hampden offered a £500 wager (equivalent to about £43000 in present-day terms[147]) in a magazine advertisement to anyone who could demonstrate a convex curvature in a body of water such as a river, canal, or lake. Wallace, intrigued by the challenge and short of money at the time, designed an experiment in which he set up two objects along a six-mile (10 km) stretch of canal. Both objects were at the same height above the water, and he mounted a telescope on a bridge at the same height above the water as well. When seen through the telescope, one object appeared higher than the other, showing the curvature of the earth.</p>

<p>The judge for the wager, the editor of Field magazine, declared Wallace the winner, but Hampden refused to accept the result. He sued Wallace and launched a campaign, which persisted for several years, of writing letters to various publications and to organisations of which Wallace was a member denouncing him as a swindler and a thief. Wallace won multiple libel suits against Hampden, but the resulting litigation cost Wallace more than the amount of the wager and the controversy frustrated him for years.&quot;</p>

<p>Another one, more detailed:</p>

<p>&quot;There were doubtless many scientists around who could have pointed out that Rowbotham&#39;s results are comfortably explained by the refraction of light close to a warm surface, the basis of many desert mirages. But no one seemed to have the stomach for more experimenting until Alfred Russel Wallace, noted for espousing the new theory of evolution and hence used to the impolite cut and thrust involved, set up a rather more elaborate experiment. In part, this was because one John Hampden of Swindon had underwritten a wager of some £500 [£1,000?] that a new experiment would establish the flatness of the earth for all time. </p>

<p>Three barges were used, on each of which was erected a straight rod, all the same height. The barges were moored two miles from each other along the same stretch of water. The tops of the rods were thus all the same distance above the surface of the earth. Using a theodolite, Wallace sighted from the top of the first rod to the top of the third. If the earth was flat, the top of the middle rod would lie on the same line. </p>

<p>In fact, because the earth was curved, the third rod was lower than the second: the second marker was a clear 32 inches above the line from the first to the third (sometimes reported to be five feet -- doubtless to emphasise the clear victory for the Globularists). </p>

<p>This makes the diameter of the earth 7920 miles -- pretty good for 1870, as we now believe that the earth&#39;s equatorial diameter is 7926 miles (the earth isn&#39;t a perfect sphere, and has different diameters at different places). Unfortunately for Wallace, but fortunately for those of us who are enjoying the story, the Zetetics (also known as the &#39;planists&#39;, by the way) looked at the same results and somehow managed to convince themselves that a trick of perspective was involved and that this did, after all, prove that the earth was flat! John Hampden refused to pay up, and the matter went to court some six years later. In a wonderful instance of jurisprudential cunning, the presiding judge declined to rule on what might be deduced from the experiments and contented himself with adjudging that such wagers were not legally binding! Hampden responded badly to a verdict that had, after all, saved him £500. He became obsessed and conducted a campaign of vilification against Wallace for the rest of his life, which led to several prosecutions for libel and accompanying prison sentences.&quot;</p>

<p>It was more like &quot;YOU PROVED ME WRONG?! YOU MUST HAVE CHEATED!&quot;</p>
