That comment was linked to <a href="/r/bestof">/r/bestof</a> today and received over 1500+ upvotes before it was removed by <a href="/u/davidreiss666">/u/davidreiss666</a> for no apparent reason. </p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3djjxw/lets_talk_content_ama/ct5qt8e?context=3">Just this week, /u/davidreiss666 spoke out against an open reddit platform and against subreddits that he deemed hateful and was heavily downvoted for it after redditors went after him and exposed his past history as a biased and corrupt moderator of dozens of subreddits. The guy clearly has an agenda and it is why he removed the post from /r/bestof because he disagreed with everyone upvoting it.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/qhbvqmu.png">Screenshot of his comment.</a></p>

<p>A subreddit as large as <a href="/r/bestof">/r/bestof</a> with millions of subscribers is controlled by a biased, dictatorial jackass who hates free and open discussion and goes to any lengths that he can to make everyone on reddit see everything in the stupid way that he does. How wonderful. <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/373rr2/this_week_i_was_banned_from_400_subreddits_in_a/">This isn&#39;t the only time he has been the topic of discussion in /r/conspiracy either.</a></p>

<p>I saw that Whisper post earlier today on BestOf and it was seriously eye opening. It completely changed the way I think of censorship when it comes to bad words on TV, ignorant online comments, etc. The fact that such a profound post would be censored is 1) amazing irony, and 2) proof that people who consider themselves &quot;progressive&quot; and &quot;liberal&quot; are just as capable of being regressive and repressive creeps.</p>

<p>Do you think anything will change?   This mod will remain a mod and remain doing what he is doing with no censure.</p>

<p>It has been proven that nothing changes unless the public outcry reaches every news organization in the world and reddit fears losing money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>His reply is worth repeating. </p>

<p>&quot; &amp;gt;? This isn&#39;t any change in policy: we&#39;ve always banned hate speech, and we always will. It&#39;s not up for debate.</p>

<p>Just watch me. </p>

<p>The only thing you can do to stop me debating it is ban me, too. Then you can ban all the people who object to banning me. And so forth. </p>

<p>&amp;gt;You can bitch and moan all you like, but me and my team aren&#39;t going to be responsible for encouraging behaviors that lead to hate.</p>

<p>That&#39;s exactly what <em>are</em> doing to when you take it upon yourselves to allow this opinion and not that one. </p>

<p>A man is only responsible for that which he controls. No control, no responsibility. You did not make him say what he said. </p>

<p>You were not responsible for it. I say <em>were not</em>. Now you are. Because you took it upon yourself to arbitrate. To impose control. Now you have made yourselves responsible for anything that gets said here. Because you could have stopped it. </p>

<p>We always want to compromise our principles when we stand to get hurt, or when we stand to profit, or when those principles protect something we find distasteful. But once you compromise a principle, it&#39;s not a principle any longer. It&#39;s window dressing. </p>

<p>Those who wish to impose control on what others may think or say always have some excuse that sounds reasonable. They&#39;re protecting you from the racists. Or the communists. Or the captialist-imperialist warmongers. Or the pedophiles. Or the witches. </p>

<p>But it&#39;s always just that, an excuse. There&#39;s no actual danger that they wish to prevent. They simply wish to stop others from saying that which they find distasteful. </p>

<p>For what is the real danger in allowing a man to say &quot;nigger&quot;? Is that word so persuasive that people are going to see things his way? Are small, narrow, petty ideologies really that much stronger than open, free, and progressive ones? Are all your users children, who cannot be trusted to reject dangerous and stupid ideas, who therefore can only be exposed to safe, pre-screened ones?</p>

<p>Look, you&#39;re obviously a young person, and can therefore be excused for reacting emotionally rather than thinking, but you&#39;ve made a serious mistake. People who subvert democratic processes, whether it&#39;s a political election or just the orange and blues arrows, always think they are doing the right thing. They always think they are serving the greater good. </p>

<p>But they fail to see that their notion of what the greater good is is not privileged over anyone else&#39;s.</p>

<p>You found what he said distasteful. Fine. Probably so would I. </p>

<p>But there is an appropriate response to that. </p>

<p>You have an account. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a little blue arrow button. </p>

<p>Cast your one vote like everybody else, and stop trying to be a superdelegate.&quot;</p>

<p>When i was a mod of a medium sized subreddit that was exactly how I viewed it. Over time I decided we&#39;d remove comments but I knew as soon as we did that we were essentially taking over responsibility for what was said.</p>

<p>Eventually, and it took a while, I started to remove comments that looked <em>to me</em> like consistent and concentrated POV-pushing. If i recognized a name and that person was consistently pushing an unpopular POV in the subreddit I&#39;d ask him to go elsewhere. Then I&#39;d just start quietly removing those comments.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure a lot of people would think that makes me literally Hitler but I saw it as being an editor. The subreddit had a direction that I wanted it to go and I could not do that without exterminating a few persistent and clever splinters in the plan.</p>

<p>I eventually resigned because the admins irritated me too many times. However, the subreddit is still on track to where I would have liked it to go. My only regret is not putting it out explicitly so that people knew we were doing it.</p>

<p>Free Speech rights don&#39;t extend to privately owned platforms. None of us has a right that exceeds the ownership prerogative of reddit&#39;s controlling interests. </p>

<p>That results in ugly shit being done to users, of course. And I far from condone that. But there are other avenues we can use to address this. Calling it a violation of our &#39;rights&#39; as American citizens makes resistance to the censorship sound petty, uninformed, and frankly childish. </p>

<p>And that&#39;s exactly what those behind the censorship want: for our position to sound unreasonable. </p>

<p>Who is putting a gun to people&#39;s heads and forcefully exposing them to &quot;destructive subreddits&quot;?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never been exposed to, say, Coontown, because I know I wouldn&#39;t like it, and therefore I&#39;ve never opened my browser and typed in the address and gone there.  In fact, the only reason I even know about Coontown&#39;s existence is <em>because of the very people bitching about it all the time</em>.</p>

<p>Posts in such subreddits do not, to my knowledge, ever get frontpaged or show up in places like <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>.  You&#39;re really not going to see any of that shit unless you willingly expose yourself to it.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I am vehemently anti-pornography.  You want to talk destructive?  Talk to an older person who has been a long-time consumer of porn and ask them how it has affected their personal relationships, marriages, and life.  And this website is flooded up to it&#39;s tits in porn; it is almost inescapable.  Do I complain about it or rally to shut down subs?  No.  I just don&#39;t click the porn links that show up on the frontpage or in <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>, or go to the porn subs. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t like a sub?  Don&#39;t go to that sub.  It&#39;s that simple.  </p>

<p>Yes you are right about the mods not owning the subreddits, but they are charge of them and they are for the most part, allowed to remove post if they so choose so. Remember that reddit doesn&#39;t make the subreddits. It&#39;s the user base that makes them and unless reddit goes all gestapo and takes control of one, the mods edit post as the see fit. </p>

<p>when people reference reddit free speech they dont refer to a legal right to it, but to a users privilege that has weight because without it, reddit wouldnt have become what it has.</p>
