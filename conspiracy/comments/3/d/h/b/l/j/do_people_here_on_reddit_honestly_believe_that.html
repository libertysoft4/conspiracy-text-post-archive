    <div class="md"><p>Call me a cynic, but this all reminds me of the buzz surrounding Obama back in 2008. Besides, even if Sanders is genuine (and that&#39;s a big &quot;if&quot;), how much of a difference can one man make?</p>

<p>Big Business and their friends in Congress have their own agenda. If Sanders vision conflicts with that agenda what happens? Gridlock. That&#39;s when all those campaign promises show their true value.</p>

<p>It&#39;s kind of like karma points. Might make you feel good when you get/give them, but not worth much in the real world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But Obama was a political newbie, and there&#39;s evidence to suggest that he worked at a known CIA front. Of course, voters didn&#39;t know about that back in &#39;04. Sanders has a solid political background and a clear history of voting right along the lines of what a lot of people here might agree with. Obama came from left field and sold us the new American Dream, which we lapped up willingly. I don&#39;t think anyone is absolutely incorruptible, but I can only hope. I&#39;ll be voting for Sanders because if he can be trusted there&#39;s still a fighting chance, and if not we are pretty fucked</p>

<p>But we are in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and a lot of people believe that the deep state is calling the shots no matter who gets elected. Then throw in the TPP which will (in some circumstances) give multinational corps a power that supersedes US law/Constitution.</p>

<p>Now I&#39;m honestly asking &quot;How much difference could Sanders make even if he wanted to?&quot;</p>

Bernie could begin to address societal issues, but the body count will still be high.  America is rusting next to China, as the world seeks a recourse to the dollar, but like addicts, they keep coming back.  Like I said, shit-show, modernize or fall apart.

    <div class="md"><p>If I&#39;ve learned anything these past few years, I&#39;ve learned this. </p>

<p>Some politicians (some, a very small bunch, let&#39;s say), are genuinely campaigning with the world&#39;s best intentions as their model. They WANT to change the world. They see that the world is fucked up, and want to be that helping hand. I firmly believe Obama was this way before he got elected. But here&#39;s the thing, that will last until the old Pres sits down with the new, and the new guy is told exactly how it is. I imagine he&#39;s told there&#39;s no deviation from the plan (whatever that may be), I imagine he&#39;s told, &quot;no, you can&#39;t save the world, don&#39;t try&quot;, and so on and so fourth.  My guess is the only Presidents that have tried to buck the system are Lincoln and JFK (could be wrong about Lincoln though).   My point of this rant is this: It doesn&#39;t matter how good Sanders&#39; intentions are, he&#39;ll get sat down and told what&#39;s what. and then biz will continue as usual. </p>

In that particular regard, there are no equals other than Elizabeth Warren and Alan Grayson who aren&#39;t running.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whoever this Sanders is [sorry ignorant UK resident] but even if he is the nicest guy who is full of beans to bring about change for the better, keep an eye on him.
After a year, he&#39;ll be grey haired, miserable looking and lifeless, just like every other US president in modern times.</p>

<p>Why? Because he will find out that he is not in charge at all, that all of his ideas are futile and that he is only a puppet on a string.
It has happened far too often to be ignored.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you feel like what he says is &quot;Freedom&quot; (having the government monitor every transaction you make, regardless of whether it harms another person or not) then you are simply going to fall for this kind of thing over and over again.  The very mindset of having a &quot;good king&quot; to watch over his &quot;children&quot; will seep into your other decision making processes very destructively.</p>

<p>It surprises me that people still buy the whole &quot;White Knight&quot; politician after the ultra-obvious in-your-face case of Obama.  Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like the appeal Sanders has, he may even have a chance, but still a politician who has mostly folded when it mattered, such as voting for ACA and dropping his condition that at least the Public Option was part of it, or pretending a filibuster that was not even a real filibuster, just for show, and it was a good one. At least we can grant that he brings up good and forgotten topics.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a good question and I don&#39;t really have an answer. It just bothers me that people believe thier vote counts. Obama said a million times that if he was elected the first thing he&#39;d do is bring the troops home. And here we are almost 2 full terms later and most of them are still there. Now apply this to all the problems we have in this country and all the promises politicians have been making for the last few decades. It just pisses me off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Call me a cynic, but this all reminds me of the buzz surrounding Obama back in 2008. Besides, even if Sanders is genuine (and that&#39;s a big &quot;if&quot;), how much of a difference can one man make?</p>

<p>Big Business and their friends in Congress have their own agenda. If Sanders vision conflicts with that agenda what happens? Gridlock. That&#39;s when all those campaign promises show their true value.</p>

<p>It&#39;s kind of like karma points. Might make you feel good when you get/give them, but not worth much in the real world.</p>
