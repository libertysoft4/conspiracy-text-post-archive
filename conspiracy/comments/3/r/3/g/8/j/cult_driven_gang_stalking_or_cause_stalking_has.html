<p>Community-based harassment is a grown-up version of school yard bullying.Multiple individuals within a community participate in the harassment and stalking of a single individual. However, rather than attack a victim physically, techniques are used to undermine a person psychologically. This can be far more damaging than a physical attack because not only is it very hard to prove, but it is extremely traumatizing for the victim. (Also known as cause stalking or gang stalking).</p>

<p>What sets community-based harassment apart from the related examples to the right is that the reason it takes place is often obscure to the victim. Without a solid reason for its occurrence, victims are often dismissed as delusional.</p>

<p>In addition, this form of harassment often leaves the target a victim of ridicule among friends and family because of the subtle nature of the attacks, which further compounds the trauma to the victim. It is emotionally draining and isolating to the victims because it is extremely difficult to prove, and virtually impossible to prosecute.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do not like to revisit it because it raises my anxiety and i do not wanna give away identify myself.  The point of me telling others how to make it stop is simply to save them from the hell i experienced.  I will say after i fired upon them i went and looked around and they was some kinda hearing aid looking device in little black bag on the ground.  I suppose they dropped as bullets whizzed past they head.  I took my time and aimed but intentionally missed their heads on the first shot, the rest of shots i just squeezed off in the direction they or him/her had taken off running.  Google gang stalking and you will find stories nearly identical to mine except i have not heard of anyone else taking it to a level where.noone believes me so i must first give warning shot and if it started again was.gonna be a head shot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes we were.  Still i have questions as why did i become a &quot;targeted individual&quot; i do not know if they choose victims at random or have studied and chosen &quot;TI&quot; because of a predisposition to &quot;the power of suggestion&quot;  just glad its over with now.

<p>why did i become a &quot;targeted individual&quot;</p>

<p>that&#39;s a good question. i suggest you research, that&#39;s what i did, only two books i&#39;ve read, <em>1996</em> by Gloria Naylor &amp; <em>The Invisible Crime</em> by Michael F. Bell, they are what i&#39;d consider &quot;extreme* but it gives a clue to how sinister stalking can be. </p>

<p>Interesting term. We have several subscribers here that, when they make a post, instantly get downvoted and reported (even though no rules are broken). Certain topics get brigaded with tons of personal attacks against the submitter.</p>

<p>That tactic does drive some users here to get very defensive and sometimes they get quite angry at their abusers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont know about paranoid schitzophrenics much but seems like that may make a bad target cause of poor impulse control and thinking someone out to kill them could lead to a murder real quick like.  But as i said i am not well informed on the schitzophrenic mind so you are very possibly right.  All i know about schitzos is the horror stories you occasionally hear on the news where one has slaughtered his family cause they thoughf they were possessed and shit like that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it&#39;s interesting that gang stalking has resulted in so many murders that were obviously unnecessary. Even if one legitimately thought that a psychological torture program could be justified, it clearly has lead to the wholesale slaughter of innocents. The kids at Sandy Hook included, probably. Then you have your useful idiots, such as those that are monitoring this post, who surely must be in denial about all the lone shooters that they&#39;ve had a hand in causing. What it all boils down to is: a) this is a highly profitable program for a few truly evil companies; b) there are a lot of &quot;patriots&quot; that will sell their brothers and their descendants to the lowest bidder.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This nonsense is real.</p>

<p>Many reasons to gang stalk someone. But mostly to drive the victim to commit suicide, or to just die</p>

<p>There is a company in Cape Town South Africa that makes a profit out of killing for insurance fraud.</p>

<p>Now do you think they are stupid enough to just knife or shoot an employee with a normal gun, given they do this year in year out? Offcourse not. Gang stalking/Electronic harassment would be the perfect weapon for such a money making scheme.</p>

<p>Company actually runs a scam, intent is juse to hire someone then kill him</p>

    <div class="md"><p>just remember the basic math these worthless pos gang stalking lifeforms cant grasp in their weak pathetic small minds. gang stalking = lone shooters/mass murderers/violent criminals = dead gang stalkers</p>

<p>past few years there&#39;s been more gang stalking so that means more gang stalking = more lone shooters = more dead gang stalkers</p>

<p>i dunno if beetlejuice is legit. my gs&#39;ing is in pussy bitch ass san diego county where everyone&#39;s either a ti or involved in gang stalking. i forgot what i said, but i literally got on my balcony and screamed i was gonna kill all you mother fuckers. add to that i stroke my throat with my middle finger at them. i&#39;ve driven my car withing inches of the retard gang stalkers on the street. i&#39;ve done lots to let them know i wanna kill them but my gs&#39;ing hasnt stopped. though it does have an effect on them that i benefit off of.  </p>

<p>and for some crazy reason they havent killed me, despite being broke as hell and having no real shielding. maybe the bosses are part of the lower level illuminati and they want me to further their gun control agenda by doing a mass murder? lol no, the bosses for my gang stalking are among, and arguably, the absolute worst worthless retarded coward pedophile lifeforms on the planet. im not just saying that, i have proof that they are. even for gang stalking, they&#39;re dumb as hell</p>

<p>i dont agree with the pussy ass non violent approach to these spiritual bottom feeders. they&#39;re trying to fuckin kill you! the system is against you. parts of it is heavily involved and highly active in your gang stalking. but you have a green light to make up your own way to fight it. if you had a family and they were microwaving them to death, and you knew who was doing it and you knew how to kill them and get away with it, you have a job to do. if i knew how to kill them and get away with it i wouldnt hesitate. i know how to kill them, but i dont know how to get away with it. </p>

<p>anyway, enjoy the long term consequences of gang stalking. im looking forward to the dead gang stalkers on the news in 2016</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The method is so subtle to make it appear borderline, so people are having a hard time believing you.</p>

<p>This happens to many people. Men were made gay and such. Women probably were abused by their husband or coworkers.</p>

<p>Its to downgrade society. To make it disfunctional. I dont understand why those people are so determined to bully?</p>

<p>They even threaten parents to suppress their own children. Somehow they convinced parents that their child is a treat if not suppressed.</p>

<p>They do anything they can to control you. To hinder you from developing. I think its like in the soviet union, citizens are controling citizens. They are made to feel special if they done so. Like the novel 1984.</p>

<p>They reward the defiant people and allow them to continue their wicked bussiness. But they bulied the normal people into submission toward the sick system.</p>
