        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve never posted before but I wanted to know if any one else had experienced this. 2 days ago in work I was talking to a friend about music particually shitty music from a few years ago, I mentioned Nickelback - How You Remind Me and then after hearing about a couple of other bands that she used to like I said I bet you liked Evanescence and tried to remember the name of the song Bring Me Back to Life. Fast forward to this morning and I go on the Google Play Store and <a href="http://i.imgur.com/SHBvbSV.jpg">This</a> is the first page I thought back to Friday and thought it was a coinsidence I click more and see <a href="http://i.imgur.com/HVeuceS.jpg">This</a> I know I didn&#39;t google them because I was working, I dont have any music on my phone and I dont use anything like spotify so I told my girlfriend and we decided to see if we could talk and make it do it again so we talked about Arctic Monkeys and kept on mentioning the band name and there latest album AM I refreshed the app store scrolled down recommended and seen <a href="http://i.imgur.com/YgExp6v.jpg">this</a> straight away. Has anyone else noticed? I am almost certain that my phone is listening to me for targeted ads, is this even legal? </p>

<p>Edit: Added screenshots</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually looking at them it appears the first and second picture were taken one minute apart, with the same battery life, then the third pic which is supposedly one day later is taken at the same time (10:43) but with a 1% higher battery life. The phone is charging as you can see in the battery symbol, but if you look at the notification icons in the top left you can see an email has been received, so what happened is in the second screenshot you can see the WiFi has up and down arrows, meaning that was probably when it was downloading the email. So the first and second picture were taken one minute apart which does line up with the story, but the third image would either be in the same minute, and the battery charged by 1% and received an email OR it was taken the next day at the exact same time at a 1% higher battery after getting an email. So 90% chance that all screenshots were taken in a row, OP is a phony. Although the moral of the story is right, Google is listening all (or at least some of) the time, and harvesting that data.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One thing that I think about sometimes having been using computers for quite a while is what the hell is eating up all the processing power these days,   and in some cases it&#39;s obvious but in others not so much.  When I first started getting into computers they ran at 50mhz and below (the 486dx1 era) and they ran full color guis,  at decent enough resolutions like I think most good monitors then ran at least 800x600 no problem but can&#39;t recall,   </p>

<p>Now we have multiple cores running in the multi ghz, even the lowest power states are tens of times faster than a computer of that era,  it makes me wonder what could be running behind the scenes or even on a firmware level in some cases.  It&#39;s probably just mild paranoia from hearing about all the back doors and loopholes but it doesn&#39;t seem that far fetched when you know that 20mhz and 4mb of memory is enough to run an entire OS and applications in full color and 20mhz is a throw -away amount of resources on any modern device outside like an arduino. . .</p>

<p>Most of us also do ten times as much computing as people did on those early computers. Right now on my PC I am using my web browser, streaming music from the spotify app, and downloading a game update in the steam client. I have 85 total processes currently stored in memory. </p>

<p>That depends entirely on what OS it is you are running...OS&#39;s today are exponentially more complex than something like ms-dos or early windows versions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know that they are, I guess my point was that windows versions and Linux and so on that will run on 25mhz and 4mb of memory, they actually did alot.  My first pc had that and I could have dos5, or 6, running windows 3 on top, and Microsoft works on top of that all while running a Gui,   so my point was there could be something running behind the scenes using very little resources and you would have no idea,   in those days you really wouldn&#39;t see that. By the way my friend at the time had a 486 25sx,  which was like the celeron of the time,  no math coprocessor, and 12mb of memory and could run windows 95 which multitasking,   and he could browse the Web,  download something etc all at the same time in the space of 25mhz, and 12mb plus probably some small amount of disk swap.  </p>

<p>And we really don&#39;t do that much more than we used to,  steam isn&#39;t new music streaming isn&#39;t new , I remember on 100mhz pentium and 24mb of memory having multiple Web browser open and my email client autorefreshijg in the background while streaming with RealPlayer or Winamp,  and plus an IRC client doing Xdcc transfers ,  the games we run are certainly more advanced but software itself while it might do a lot more in the way of active spell check and run faster and open and save files faster, the actual functions haven&#39;t changed a whole lot I would say.  People even had 3d accelerators and opengl and DIRECTx on those machines though the only accelerator I had until I bought a Riva later, first 128 then Tnt was a rendition vertite which I bought because quake supported it and I saw it in a magazine LOL, much different times. </p>

<p>Basically if you want to be as spy-safe as possible don&#39;t use any Google (including youtube) Microsoft, Apple and Facebook (including WhatsApp) products.
And if you want to be even more safe don&#39;t use computers or smartphones at all. You will manage.</p>

OP is deliberately making it obvious that he is BSing, so that when someone finds REAL evidence of Google spying, they will not be taken seriously...AHA! </p>

<p>Now we have multiple cores running in the multi ghz, even the lowest power states are tens of times faster than a computer of that era</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most of us also do ten times as much computing as people did on those early computers. Right now on my PC I am using my web browser, streaming music from the spotify app, and downloading a game update in the steam client. I have 85 total processes currently stored in memory. </p>

<p>it doesn&#39;t seem that far fetched when you know that 20mhz and 4mb of memory is enough to run an entire OS and applications in full color</p>

<p>That depends entirely on what OS it is you are running...OS&#39;s today are exponentially more complex than something like ms-dos or early windows versions. </p>
