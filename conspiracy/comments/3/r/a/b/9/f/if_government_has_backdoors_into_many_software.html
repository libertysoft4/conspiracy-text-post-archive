    <div class="md"><p>What amazes me, considering the &quot;out of nowhere&quot; just now discovered security holes, back-doors in software, is nothing new. Even Windows 95, DOS, and Windows for Workgroups 3.11, had had that problem. </p>

<p>Now with the great fame given to Edward Snowden, and Glen Greenwald, (Oh, I know I&#39;m going to get downvoted to hell for daring to say this...but). Everyone focuses on his work for the NSA. That is true, but before he worked there as a contractor, he worked where exactly? The CIA, but that fact gets quickly dismissed and pushed under the rug. Likewise, Greenwald? He starts a new news venture with who? The owner of EBAY and PayPal. Fair enough, a few billion dollars are needed to start a large news business. However, another fact that gets quickly dismissed and shoved under the rug, is that the owner of EBAY and PayPal, is also a board member of the same company Edward Snowden was a contractor for at the NSA. In addition, neither Snowden or Greenwald release anything that threatens the system, the corrupt banking system, the Federal Reserve, any documentation about the illegal importing and selling of drugs by the CIA, political assassinations by the CIA, the consistent and frequent creation of completely fake plots planned and acted on by the FBI, the complete rape of our system of liberty, freedom, and privacy. Likewise, you never once see anyone ever dare say anything bad about Amy Goodman at &quot;democracy NOW&quot;, when almost no one knows she is worth millions. </p>

<p>Stop letting false flags, and staged events with crisis actors sway you into the &quot;OBEY&quot; &quot;OBEY&quot; &quot;SUBMIT&quot; &quot;OBEY&quot; mantra, they keep trying to drill into our heads. </p>

<p>You want to guarantee that no fake anything can ever be planted on your PC or Laptop? That is a very easy one. Take the hard drive out, and use a drill press to drill several holes into it to completely ruin any data that might be there, and only use a temporary operating system like TAILS, that runs off a CD or flashdrive, so the instant you reset the system, everything that was there is gone, since it was all held only in your RAM. Short, simple, and easy solution people. </p>

<p>Secondly, despite all the fearporn they try to smear about Tor, (which by itself isn&#39;t perfect, since it was originally created by the military), is the best option we have. Cancel and delete all your profiles on CIA(F)acebook, Twitter, etc. and only access .onion sites using Tor. Better still, for everyone that bitches about how slow Tor is, that can be solved in a instant. If every person on any DSL, Cable, or Fiber Internet connection started running a Tor node 24/7, you&#39;d see it go from a snails pace to a speed demon. </p>

<p>You want to hold the criminals in charge of this corrupted broken system accountable? Also easy. Stop following your family tradition. Either don&#39;t go and vote, or if you feel compelled to vote, only vote for anyone that isn&#39;t a Republican or a Democrat, including Tea Party, Green Party, etc. but only those that are not owned by a corporation, or tied down by any party affiliation, problem solved. </p>

<p>Request in unison, a complete and total repeal of the Patriot Act, all of NAFTA. Request in unison a complete, uncensored, truly transparent investigation of 9/11 and everyone that profited from it. </p>

<p>See? Simple, and easy solutions to most of our ills, but will anyone do it? That is the true question that should be being asked.</p>

<p>That would help, but its slow and quickly wears out when computing about large data. I sometimes run linux on a flash memory stick.</p>

<p>A chain is only as strong as its weakest link. What would you suggest for the possibility of being framed through parts of the Internet you use or network through?</p>

<p>lol </p>

<p>People are so quick to accuse Snowden, Greenwald, Chomsky, and other liberal heroes of being gatekeepers.  Greenwald in particular has made a career out of challenging the establishment and to accuse him of being a double agent or some shit is just ignorant.</p>

<p>Plus snowden knows like we know that while he is in Russia his family or people he cares about is not, hes trying to walk the fine line between releasing information about the big bad NSA while not going after the true puppet masters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is why we should have anonymous lift some GOV files and bittorrent them.

That way we can &#39;preframe&#39; the authorities and thereby prefalsify any potential frame attempts.</p>

<p>In fact we should be publishing as many &#39;traces&#39; of what they leave behind as far and wide as we can, and that way we can steganographically encode these files into every image place on websites everywhere. </p>

<p>Enough people do this on for example popular sites like imgur and reddit, then you&#39;re bound to have nearly everyone in the US with &#39;traces of CIA&#39; data--like foreign body fluid spatter in a hotel room--all over our cached media assets.</p>
