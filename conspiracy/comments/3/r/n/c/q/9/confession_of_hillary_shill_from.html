<hr/>

<p>Good afternoon. As of today, I am officially a former &quot;digital media specialist&quot; (a nice way to say &quot;paid Internet troll&quot;) previously employed by Hillary Clinton&#39;s campaign (through a PR firm). I&#39;m posting here today as a confession of sorts because I can no longer continue to participate in something that has become morally-indigestible for me. (This is a one-time throwaway account, but I&#39;ll stick around for this thread.)</p>

<p>First, my background. I am [redacted] ... and first became involved in politics during the 2008 presidential race. I worked as a volunteer for Hillary during the Democratic primary and then for the Democratic Party in the general election. I was not heavily involved in the 2012 election cycle (employment issues - volunteering doesn&#39;t pay the rent), and I wasn&#39;t really planning on getting involved in this cycle until I was contacted by a friend from college around six months ago about working on Hillary&#39;s campaign.</p>

<p>I was skeptical at first (especially after my experience as an unpaid volunteer in 2008), but I eventually came around. The work time and payment was flexible, and I figured that I could bring in a little extra money writing about things I supported anyways. After some consideration, I emailed my resume to the campaign manager he had named, and within a week, I was in play. I don&#39;t want to get bogged down on this subject, but I was involved with PPP (pay per post) on forums and in the comments section of (mostly-liberal) news and blog sites. Spending my time on weekends and evenings, I brought in roughly an extra $100 or so a week, which was a nice cushion for me.</p>

<p>At first, the work was fun and mostly unsupervised. I posted mostly positive things about Hillary and didn&#39;t engage in much negativity. Around the middle of July, however, I received notification that the team would be focusing not on pro-Hillary forum management, but on &quot;mitigation&quot; (the term our team leader used) for a Vermont senator named Bernie Sanders. I&#39;d been out of college for several years and hadn&#39;t heard much about Sanders, and so I decided to do some research to get a feel for him. </p>

<p>To be honest, I was skeptical of what Sanders was saying at the beginning, and didn&#39;t have much of a problem pointing out the reasons why I believed that Hillary was the better candidate. Over a period of two months, I gradually started to find Bernie appealing, even if I still disagreed with him on some issues. By September, I found myself as a closet Bernie supporter, though I still believed that Hillary was the only electable Democratic candidate. </p>

<p>The real problem for me started around the end of September and the beginning of October, when there was a change of direction from the team leader again. Apparently, the higher-ups in the firm caught wind of an impending spending splurge by the Clinton campaign that month and wanted to put up an impressive display. We received very specific instructions about how and what to post, and I was aghast at what I saw. It was a complete change in tone and approach, and it was extremely nasty in character. We changed from advocates to hatchet men, and it left a very bad taste in my mouth.</p>

<p>Just to give you an idea, here are some of the guidelines for our posting in October:</p>

<p>1) Sexism. This was the biggest one we were supposed to push. We had to smear Bernie as misogynistic and out-of-touch with modern sensibilities. He was to be characterized as &quot;an old white male relic that believed women enjoyed being gang raped&quot;. Anyone who tried to object to this characterization would be repeatedly slammed as sexist until they went away or people lost interest.</p>

<p>2) Racism. We were instructed to hammer home how Bernie supporters were all privileged white students that had no idea how the world worked. We had to tout Hillary&#39;s great record with &quot;the blacks&quot; (yes, that&#39;s the actual way it was phrased), and generally use racial identity politics to attack Sanders and bolster Hillary as the only unifying figure.</p>

<p>3) Electability. All of those posts about how Sanders can never win and Hillary is inevitable? Some of those were us, done deliberately in an attempt to demoralize Bernie supporters and convince them to stop campaigning for him. The problem is that this was an outright fabrication and not an accurate assessment of the current political situation. But the truth didn&#39;t matter - we were trying to create a new truth, not to spread the existing truth.</p>

<p>4) Dirty tactics. This is where things got really bad. We were instructed to create narratives of Clinton supporters as being victimized by Sanders supporters, even if they were entirely fabricated. There were different instructions about how to do it, but something like this (<a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/10/31/1443064/-Dis-heartened-Hillary-Supporter">http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/10/31/1443064/-Dis-heartened-Hillary-Supporter</a>) is a perfect example. These kind of posts are manufactured to divide and demoralize Sanders supporters, and are entirely artificial in nature. (The same thing happened in 2008, but it wasn&#39;t as noticeable before social media and public attention focused on popular forums like Reddit).</p>

<p>5) Opponent outreach. There are several forums and imageboards where Sanders is not very popular (I think you can imagine which ones those are.) We were instructed to make pro-Sanders troll posts to rile up the user base and then try to goad them into raiding or attacking places like this subreddit. This was probably the only area where we only had mixed success, since that particular subset of the population were more difficult to manipulate than we originally thought.</p>

<p>In any case, the final nail in the coffin for me happened last night. I was on an imageboard trying to rile up the Trump-supporting natives with inflammatory Bernie posting, and the sum of responses I received basically argued that at least Bernie was genuine in his belief, even if they disagreed with his positions, which made him infinitely better than the 100% amoral and power-hungry Hillary.</p>

<p>I had one of those &quot;what are you doing with your life&quot; moments. When even the scum of 4chan think that your candidate is too scummy for their tastes, you need to take a good hard look at your life. Then this morning I read that the National Association of Broadcasters were bankrolling both Clinton and Rubio, and that broke the camel&#39;s back. I emailed my resignation this morning. </p>

<p>I&#39;m going to go all in for Bernie now, because I truly believe that the Democratic Party has lost its way, and that redemption can only come by standing for something right and not by compromising for false promises and fake ideals. I want to apologize to everyone here for my part in this nasty affair, and I hope you will be more aware of attempts to sway you away from supporting the only candidate that can bring us what we need.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A bit late to this conversation: here are some ways to tell if someone is astroturfing: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Comments appear without much context. The less contextually appropriate they are (example: someone responding to a post that says A is great, but they say but B is better even in an unrelated area) If the conversation doesn&#39;t &quot;flow&quot;, basically.</p></li>
<li><p>Accounts are new and have little to no content, and their steered content is posted very recently after account registration. Oftentimes to avoid looking like an astroturfing account they will post to an unrelated area two-three times, and make periodic other posts. If content is more than 50% related to a cause and said cause was within very close proximity to a registration, odds are good it&#39;s astroturfing (not always though).</p></li>
<li><p>Said posts are done in the most visible areas. An astroturfer will very unlikely respond to a post that&#39;s relatively unseen in most cases. This is for obvious reasons: more eyes are better. If an account has no posts in low traffic areas, more likely an astroturfer. A fanatic will usually post where people can&#39;t see anything, an astroturfer will go where the eyes are. </p></li>
<li><p>Astroturfers use a few methods to find places to post but the one of the biggest (other than simply knowing the big areas to post, big forums, popular article comments etc) are RSS feeds with keywords related to what they&#39;re astroturfing. This is why the out-of-context stuff happens a lot. Something pops up on a feed and they respond even if it has no bearing on the conversation at hand. Depending on the tools they use (some are more advanced and can derive the value of a conversation), a thread will pop up and they will be encouraged to respond to that thread. So if a thread isn&#39;t likely to be picked up by some sort of search criteria, it&#39;s unlikely to be astroturfing. </p></li>
<li><p>They never give up until you don&#39;t respond even if it&#39;s repeating the same thing over and over again. Basically this is to drag people through the mud.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The biggest astroturfing I&#39;ve ever seen was on Reddit with regards to fracking. It had to be the single worst astroturfing job ever because every single thread related to fracking that came up had like 8-12 dudes come in and pop up with some irrelevant bullshit and say fracking is actually good for the environment even if the conversation wasn&#39;t really that fracking oriented and with zero context with their talking points. </p>

<p>I am not saying Hillary is doing this, BTW, I don&#39;t have eyes everywhere or anything. those are just trademarks of how people do this. Unfortunately I may have made it easier for astroturfers to avoid being noticed haha. But buys in the comments sections/forums are a better bang for your buck than actually trying to have an article shill for you since more people trust the comment sections of articles than articles themselves. </p>

<p>I have no relation to any astroturfing campaigns or anything of the such, but I see it in my job. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Astroturfing is basically a fake grass-roots movement. It would be like a company planting fake reviews for their product all over the internet, and making it appear that many people are interested in a product. In this case, it is a lot of fake accounts voicing their opinion that Hillary is the best presidential choice. The idea is that people who are not as educated/invested in politics and do not have strong views, will find this information and be persuaded by it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Astroturfing is the practice of hiding the sponsors of a message or organization to make it appear as if it comes from and is supported by grassroots participants. The Tea Party Movement is a great example; while on the surface it appears to be a spontaneous movement that originated by normal, everyday people, in actuality it&#39;s both heavily funded and organized by large political groups who in turn are funded by Charles and David Koch, two far right-wing billionaires.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not only done in politics. Sometimes corporations will try to make it look like a product or service is more popular than it really is by using these tactics. For example Amazon and Yelp keep having to fight off people paid to give good reviews and sometimes bloggers are paid for endorsements but don&#39;t disclose that. There&#39;s even a related practice where an ad is disguised as a news article.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just to set the record straight.... </p>

<p>The post was removed by us on <a href="/r/SandersForPresident">/r/SandersForPresident</a> because the OP failed to provide any proof of his employment with the Clinton campaign. </p>

<p>We didn&#39;t remove it for any other reason other than that. If he provides substantial proof that he is who he says he is, and that the campaign is implementing the strategy that he says they are, then we&#39;d likely allow the content. But until then, it&#39;s no different than saying something like, &quot;I met Obama at a bar once and he spit on my baby!&quot; </p>

<p>Anyways. That&#39;s all. I&#39;ve seen people suggest that we, the mods, are Hillary shills. This is false. We&#39;ve been campaigning for Bernie since before Bernie even had a campaign. I wish I got paid for this work, though... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s some thoughts:</p>

<p>1) There are people in this very thread who are willing to shill for Hilary. </p>

<p>2) This is not the only confession. More are in the comments here. </p>

<p>3) Shills exist and come from a wide variety of governments and corporations. All of this is admitted in the mainstream press. See <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/InternetPR/comments/3gco80/archive_of_factual_information_on_shills_mostly/">here.</a></p>

<p>So, this should not be a surprise. That&#39;s really all I wanted to say. I&#39;m also curious about this statement: &quot;If he provides substantial proof...&quot; Has there been some evidence provided to you guys? </p>

<p>I don&#39;t even know what that means. <em>Anything</em> can &quot;sound legitimate* if it&#39;s said in the right way.

<p>or</p>

<p>That&#39;s a potential headline we&#39;re looking at. I mean, we&#39;ve had plenty of news outlets cover our behavior (outcries about debate results, mostly) and it makes us look like a bunch of petulant children. And you&#39;re suggesting we want MORE of that? </p>

<p>The OP was asked to provide proof. ANY proof. Anything. He or she didn&#39;t even reply. That&#39;s a pretty big red flag if you ask me.

    <div class="md"><p>Consider the people running for president, the vast majority of them come from congress or governors.  We are basically limited to only picking our president from this pool.  Outsiders sometimes try to run but they basically always flop because they have no real experience in getting anything done.  This is a problem, has been a problem for a while, and will continue being a problem in the foreseeable future, because this pool has a lot of rotten eggs that are already sell outs.  Why is this pool a bunch of sellouts?  Because they are almost exclusively picked from a different pool: the state congresses.  This is where the real problem is.  These politicians often times run unopposed and run completely unchecked because there is zero voter apathy at this level.  At this level elite have massive influence over politician&#39;s prospects of getting elected because an even higher percent of the money in local politics come from people very well off in those communities.  This is the real filter, the elites are able to pick the people who get to even start at the base of the ladder.</p>

<p>Imagine the government is a company that almost always gets upper management through promotions.  If you allow a filter so that only one type of person is allowed entry level positions, eventually that type of person will fill the board of directors and CEO positions.  This is where we are in the government.  We have had record apathy in local politics for a generation because we have been convinced it doesn&#39;t matter.</p>

<p>To suggest that Obama and Bush were just continuations is just stupid.  Obama didn&#39;t give us the change he promised because he thought that once he was elected congress/politicians would see the error of their ways and allow changes.  This didn&#39;t happen because the population didn&#39;t care once he got elected about that.  The population was focused on specific issues and at no point were a significant number of people loudly complaining that a politician might lose their job if something didn&#39;t happen.</p>

<p>Politicians being silenced, neutralized, or murdered basically doesn&#39;t happen.  Of course you can point to speculation of an example or two but that doesn&#39;t mean it is universal.  If it were universal the offenders would get caught.  There are enough people that raise issues that don&#39;t back down to suggest that it can&#39;t be universal.  The politicians that want to change things against the establishment don&#39;t get elected because they don&#39;t get support at the local level, not because they get killed off or blackmailed or whatever you are implying.</p>

<p>If you want a government that is working for you, make it possible for politicians to have a job working for you.  Right now they basically can&#39;t.</p>

<p>Obama was bought by wall street during his campaign, and his &quot;hope and change&quot; was just empty platitudes for people to fill in with whatever they personally believed.

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I knew this was happening right after Bernie announced and I joined some Bernie groups. There were these omnipresent nice ladies who were scolding and lecturiong anyone who mentioned anything critical about Hillary. They called any discussion about her record &quot;bashing,&quot; and reiterated repeatedly that &quot;Bernie wouldn&#39;t do it.&quot;</p>

<p>Then, they started calling Bernie supporters &quot;bullies.&quot; I realized that was an organized project when some gal wrote on a reddit thread that there would be more blogs coming out soon about the &quot;Bernie bullies.&quot;  Oops</p>

<p>They have been very organized, to be sure.  I just watched this video about a Hillary dirty trickster who is attributing a tacky video to Bernie sponsorship, and the code clearly links to a Hillary operative. She really does NOT need to do that. She should just lay out her real policies which are not &quot;democratic socialism&quot; and more Status Quo.  A lot of people may be comfortable with that.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not.  But she apparently has many supporters that do not care what her positions are. They will be loyal. She doesn&#39;t have to be a dirtbag.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a die hard Bernie supporter all I can say is this post is highly suspicious. It reads like a planted post designed to discredit Sander&#39;s supporters, or as a besmirching campaign to spew hatred at Hillary. Either one is unacceptable. </p>

<p>None of the alleged posting claims have actually surfaced anywhere and they are fantastic and extreme in nature. This aside from the fact that it would be idiotic of anyone to officially distribute such incriminating instructions, let alone explain the rational behind them to paid staff.</p>

<p>I know mistrust of Hillary is running high, and I can understand that with regards to the type of shenanigans the DNC has been pulling and the attacks the Hillary campaign has launched at Sanders in the wake of the security leak, however it is important to resist the temptation to be dragged into disseminating dubious information and unsubstantiated rumors.</p>

<p>There is no evidence what so ever regarding the identity of the poster, and unless there was concrete proof, I would urge everyone to resist the temptation to engage in this slander. It is not going to advance Sanders&#39; campaign one iota.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, yeah, I do know like, two on Facebook, but not real life. And a few who will hold their nose because they&#39;re terrified of Republicans. However, I know many lifelong (female) Democrats shuddering that they may have to vote Republican this time if Hillary&#39;s the candidate. And lots of Republican/Independent women who would never consider Hillary but are kind of torn on who the hell they&#39;d vote for on the Republican side, but definitely not voting Hillary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This reads like a Sanders supporter pretending to have been a Hillary shill because that&#39;s exactly what it is.  Meanwhile there&#39;s a separate conspiracy positing that it&#39;s Hillary that is launching false flag operations.  </p>

<p>There are a lot of Sanders supporters (I would say most) who adhere to his message and stay above the fray and on the issues.  Then there&#39;s the other supporters who keep pushing increasingly ridiculous nonsense, especially after she solidified her lead after the Benghazi hearing.  It must be frustrating to have your campaign not pick up the way you had hoped, but that&#39;s no excuse to push this nonsense.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t even know what that means. <em>Anything</em> can &quot;sound legitimate* if it&#39;s said in the right way. Language can be very persuasive, and the OP could very easily provide proof of his or her employment, or really <em>anything</em> that reaffirms the claims. Yet no proof has been given. </p>
