<p>If done the right way, in the spotlight, with massive social media support, and support of key politicians, banks, gold reserves, people, some corporate cooperation, then it could be done via a slow drip of getting everyone used to the idea until it becomes concrete.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s kind of fucked up yo, did Argentina invite us?!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No they didn&#39;t. I picked them because they are fairly stable and have a shit ton of land. I think if it was done in a way were it integrates with native culture, intermarriage, starting business, creating a sub economy, etc that it could be done also via a slow drip. This country also had european immigrants into various cities that intermarriage locals and integrated, but never on the level of being a colony.</p>

<p>Thing is, something has to be done to hedge bets against a collapsed U.S. that becomes a totalitarian oligarchy orwell society. Look at how Syrians are immigrating into E.U. and will create Syrian blocks and eventually outbreed the home countries population:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/06/03/us-syria-population-idUSTRE6522FS20100603">http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/06/03/us-syria-population-idUSTRE6522FS20100603</a></p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Syrian women have an average of 3.6 children each</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s on the low end. Some women have upwards of 8-12 kids.</p>

<p>Unfortunately,the SJW and feminism movement is making men in the U.S. anti marriage, anti procreation, anti women besides just sleeping around and protecting assets from marriages/divorces. </p>

<p>A lot of shit is up in the air, but seceding and/or colonizing a part of some sympathetic country I think would be the only options to establish a seed of constitutionalists</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The original America is being destroyed from within. What&#39;s happening instead is sub movements of decentralization, bitcoins, transparent movements, people wanting organic non gmo foods, labeled foods, wanting to hold corporations and governments accountable for their actions, psyop SJW movements possibly created by C.I.A. There&#39;s a lot of stuff there to dig through.</p>

<p>However, its not yet a global Oligarchy. If it was, we wouldn&#39;t be seeing the whole Syria debacle, so not everyone is on the same globalist page. Russia seems to be a last holdout along with China starting to dump U.S. debt and create and alternative BRICS system.</p>

<p>There&#39;s still room to create some sort of unified anti-globalist-fiat-debt-war-elitist movement that could really take off and thrive</p>

I have developed my &quot;psycho totalitarian bullshit&quot; trying to imagine a world in which I could be independent while free of the system, without being reduced to hunter-gatherer-sustenance-farmer, and that is what I came up with. A system that supports the individual. I&#39;ve put a lot of thought into it, years of it. What plan do you have that you think could accomplish the same goal?</p>

Agorism is basically social libertarianism aka true anarchism in the non-tainted (violent mayhem in the streets) connotation:</p>

<p><strong>Technical</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong><em><a href="http://reddit.com/r/bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></em></strong></li>
<li>P2P heterogeneous wireless mesh &#39;democratic&#39; internet such as <a href="https://opengarden.com/">opengarden</a></li>
<li>Using open source VOIP client/server software <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk_(PBX">ASTERISK</a>) -- to screw NSAT&amp;T</li>
<li>Using SIP-Voip client to your Asterisk server over WIFI on mobile phone to avoid the 120/month tithe to Verizon, et al </li>
<li>Applications that run on people&#39;s interent like <a href="http://opengarden.com/firechat/">Firechat</a></li>
<li>Torsites, .onion sites, Tor hidden services ::  <em>&quot;Darknet&quot;</em></li>
<li>Non-ICANN controlled Name services (DNS, domain names) such as <a href="https://namecoin.info/">Namecoin</a></li>
<li><a href="https://geti2p.net/">I2P</a> and <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">TOR</a>, <a href="https://freenetproject.org/">Freenet</a> project forks or inspired projects that run on OpenGarden type populist internets</li>
<li><a href="https://tails.boum.org/">Tails</a> (i2p, tor, security/anonymity enhanced off-shelf preconfigured linux)</li>
<li>Cryptography, secure chat, secure email, public key encryption that no one has ever used in the 30 yrs it&#39;s been available, even for authentication.</li>
<li>Netflix versus Hulu; Netflix versus Amazon; Netflix versus everyone.  Why?  Because netflix is ~12/month and doesn&#39;t enable advertising / hyperconsumerist industry culture.  Hulu and Amazon have commercials (even for paid content)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Administrative</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Direct Democracy, True Democracy -- abolition of &#39;representative democracy&#39;, &#39;electoral college&#39;, lobbying, money-in-politics, and all the trappings of our modern industry culture.  Requirements: 

<ol>
<li> A secure, electronic voting system with non-digital means of confirming tallies and revoting in case of parity errors, </li>
<li>A means to authenticate a citizen as a valid voter (voter registration),</li>
<li>A means for people to voluntarily participate in the creation of laws for their locality and federally as applicable.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Incentives against citizen coercion and administrative / institutional corruption.   Financial / resource bounties on reporting and providing evidence for coercion or corruption.  Rewarding whistleblowing, rather than punishing them, is true self-governance.  Severe punishment for false reporting whose basis is fraud.</li>
<li>Citizens have unfettered access to all substances that occur naturally on earth.  No animal, vegetable or mineral (even plutonioum for example) is prohibited.  If someone wants to poison themselves, they should have that right.  Laws on causing harm to others still apply.<br/></li>
<li>Citizens have unfettered access to any / all energy creation devices / methods.</li>
<li>No laws creating artificial scarcity</li>
<li>No laws creating social inequalities</li>
<li>No laws preventing sovereignty of a person to do anything within the confines of his property that do not interfere with other peoples&#39; human/civil rights or cause injury to them.</li>
<li>No laws over the fair, non injurious use of one&#39;s body (safe sex prostitution / pornography OK)</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Non-technical</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Learn how to Garden / Microfarm and work towards 100% food independence.<br/></li>
<li>Eventually overproduce food for exchange.</li>
<li>Use only heirloom / open-pollinated seeds to ensure viability / security.</li>
<li>Save your seed</li>
<li>Give away your excess seed in great abundance.   Exchange your more scarce seeds.</li>
<li>Contribute and participate in community Seed libraries.</li>
<li>Gardening is very rigorous excercise, you don&#39;t need a gym -- stay fit.</li>
<li>Learn how to use less energy.</li>
<li>Generate your own energy.</li>
<li>Become a vegetarian and eat less, to reduce costs of healthcare and prolong your lifespan  (reduced calorie diet has been shown to extend lifespan).</li>
<li>Microbial / compost based heating as a thrifty input into gardening.</li>
<li>Learn how to hygeinically store your own food properly -- drying, canning and fermenting, with focus on barter.</li>
<li>Learn foraging and herbalism in your area.</li>
<li>Relocate useful plants (ex:wild blueberries) from the forest into your property.  Do not overtake or harm endangered species unless you have competent knowledge and committment to being a proper steward.</li>
<li>Learn carpentry and how to build and repair things.</li>
<li>Find a clever way to upcycle trash into something other people want, exchange for something they make.</li>
<li>Buy used things of quality and longevity (<a href="/r/bifl">/r/bifl</a>) and repair them.</li>
<li>Buy arable, unzoned rural land to do the above, preferably one with water and water rights or at a minimum rain-catch ability.  (wells deeper than 25&#39; are expensive and require maintenance)</li>
</ul>

 The Black Live Matter movement? 
It&#39;s a revolutionary movement against the oligarchy and the agents of the state: the police.
Go to Ferguson. See what is still going on, and take that energy to your city. Movements, marches, civil disobedience doesn&#39;t just happen. It&#39;s organized. Its about making change. Look up what&#39;s happening in your community and make change happen. Start with a &quot;know your rights &quot; training and get plugged in.</p>
