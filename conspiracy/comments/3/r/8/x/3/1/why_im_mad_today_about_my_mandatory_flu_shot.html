        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve worked at a hospital for eight years now and have always gotten my flu shot because why not? Sure it&#39;s only 60% effective but it was free. A few years ago they made it mandatory because they said it was safer for us and for the patients. Sure. I&#39;ll buy it. We&#39;re high risk and have the most chance of getting it. Although I disagree with being forced to put something in my body because I think it should be my choice.</p>

<p>Today I found out that obamacare forced medical facilities to have at least 90% of their staff vaccinated or they don&#39;t get as much Medicare and Medicaid funding. </p>

<p>I feel like I was lied to, and tricked. They could have been forward about it. But they pretend every thing they do is for patient safety when it&#39;s all financial. Every move they make is for money. I don&#39;t know if there is more to it or not, or if it&#39;s all a conspiracy or just people making money. But I&#39;m mad. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the really scary part.  Flu shots are basically a joke unless they predict the exact strain right.  From the CDC: <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/flu/news/updated-vaccine-effectiveness-2014-15.htm">http://www.cdc.gov/flu/news/updated-vaccine-effectiveness-2014-15.htm</a></p>

<p>The H3N2 vaccine clocks in at a whopping 18% effective.
 Overall, the vaccine is 19% effective.  Any other field you&#39;d tell them to fuck right off if they told you their product failed 81% of the time.</p>

<p>In common with Australia and counterparts from the US, PHE has previously reported differences between the A(H3N2) vaccine strain and the strain circulating this season, otherwise known as ‘vaccine drift’. The findings have shown the vaccine to be -2% (95%CI -56 to 33% effective against the drifted A(H3N2) strain of the virus, <strong>indicating low or no effect</strong>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been tracking this since NYS DOH mandated the vaccine for healthcare workers in 2013. Evidence Based Medicine is promoted at all levels of government oversight as the 1 true medicine. High quality meta-analysis like the Cochrane reviews are &quot;at the top of the pyramid of evidence&quot; by all standard accounts. Yet, every Cochrane review looking at the question of yearly flu vaccination has found little to no benefit (NNTs of 40 and higher) and substantial industry bias in the data. So, why is the government pushing this vaccine so forcefully? Only in times of public health epidemics has the supreme court ruled that governments can override a persons consent (or following a hearing, the mentally ill)? </p>

<p>It is about the money! But, it&#39;s not the hospitals that make money (they try not to lose more money), it&#39;s the manufacturers of this vaccine. Do a google search and you will find immense controversy and fraud accusations in Europe and the WHO decades ago. If you get a brochure in your office, look at who funds the printing of most of the pamphlets...just like other big pharma pursuits...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s very simple. The flu virus enters your body &quot;most likely&quot; through your nose and mouth. The average person touches their face 2,000-3,000 times per day. We constantly touch things around us all day long, that could be contaminated with the flu virus. So by not touching anything, would be your best flu protection. If you can&#39;t do that, wash your hands frequently especially if you have been in public places and cover your mouth with a mask. With a mask covering your nose and mouth, no virus in - no virus out and if you have to scratch your nose, you can do it through your mask. And by the way, a mask will protect you from contracting the flu when someone sends the flu virus your way via a sneeze or cough. I choose not to get a flu shot for the same reason I choose not to take chemotherapy to prevent me from getting a caner tumor in the future. Not drinking that Cool-Aid. <a href="http://www.mouthshutters.com">www.mouthshutters.com</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is not about money.<br/>
Medical facilities were getting that money anyway.  But where not taking the proper care in regards to having their staff vaccinated.<br/>
The only way they understand is when money is involved so the government is letting them know their funds will be reduced/cut if they don&#39;t comply.<br/>
They are not doing this to make more money but rather to keep receiving the existing funding they have been receiving all along.</p>
