    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think decapitating another human for collecting or inheriting a bunch of imaginary &quot;currency&quot; that everyone idolizes in our planet&#39;s current paradigm will accomplish much. Your question only reiterates just how decayed and broken our global monetary system is. The state of the world we live in today will not continue because it cannot. Change is constant. We will either evolve to a utopia or fail catastrophically as we have previously, time and time again.  If you truly believe a violent revolution is the next necessary step then we have already lost.  &quot;I have a dream&quot; <strong>BANG</strong> &quot;All you need is love&quot; <strong>BANG</strong> &quot;Whenever you are confronted with an opponent. Conquer him with love&quot; <strong>BANG</strong> &quot;Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.&quot; <strong>BANG</strong> I think it&#39;s pretty clear what message the controlling elite fear most and its not &quot;Let&#39;s lob off the heads of the rich and take all their stuff.&quot; at the end of the day you will still be playing their game, on their court, by their rules. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is retarded, sorry. It&#39;s not about being rich. It&#39;s about using your money in ways that degrade society.</p>

<p>If you are rich because u set-up an efficient business and have a lot of people working for you, you are a good man.</p>

<p>If you are rich and use it to steal through financial means or don&#39;t contribute one bit to society ( financial heavens ), you aren&#39;t a good man.</p>

<p>Stop equating powerful ( rich ) to bastards without further inquiry. Some of these people busted their ass and made smart altough not immoral choices and got to the top.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t blame rich people for the state of affairs. Blame rich thieves, and altough there are a lot of them, it&#39;s not richness itself the problem. It is the means they take to their end.</p>

<p>No1 would bust their asses so hard if they knew their sons would inherit nothing, and that bring others to try the same. </p>

<p>By blaming richness you blame the best and the worst alike.</p>

<p>Power is needed for control. We just happen to have bad control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a billionaire, but I will offer an idea.</p>

<p>Some billionaires are involved with the provision of actually useful things.</p>

<p>E.g. suppose it turns out that the lead engineer at a water purification plant is actually a billionaire.  (Perhaps he inherited money but he still chose to get educated in a tough job and to work.)</p>

<p>In such a case, the execution of that particular billionaire would make society poorer.</p>

<p>However, the above is just speculation.  I don&#39;t know that there are any useful billionaires, although no doubt some people would mention Steve Jobs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>sleep-ins and sitting down and singing might be about as effective as hurling bricks through windows. Either way, if the media is refusing to be complicit you won&#39;t be getting any airtime. Throwing blocks will actually lose you points with many people.</p>

<p>Better idea: form/join local organizations that are making progressive change in your area. Be the role model for a better tomorrow.</p>
