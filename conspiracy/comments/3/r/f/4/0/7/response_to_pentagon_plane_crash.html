&quot;Because the plane vaporized...? Do you understand how fast a plane is going and the energy released as it smashes into concrete reinforced with steel? Conspiracy theories are for people who are ignorant and don&#39;t know enough about a subject matter to have the ethos to comment yet do anyways.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The plane was a Boeing 757-200. It is big, over half a football field long, about 125&#39; wingtip to wingtip, and the tail is 44&#39; tall. It has over 200 passenger seats, two titanium engines, a massive landing gear, and literally miles of wiring.  Here are the specs.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.boeing.com/history/products/757.page">http://www.boeing.com/history/products/757.page</a></p>

<p>Take a look at the Pentagon.  Zoom in.</p>

<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Pentagon.Nach_Einsturz.Rasen.jpg">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Pentagon.Nach_Einsturz.Rasen.jpg</a></p>

<p>Look carefully. There are no wings, no engines, no landing gear, no tail, no seats, no wiring, no luggage, no bodies. There is no plane there.</p>

<p>This reporter said after his close-up inspection, he saw no evidence of a plane crashing anywhere near the Pentagon.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BNqgNvUhRQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BNqgNvUhRQ</a> </p>

<p>Go to google images and look for yourself. If you search long enough, you will find a couple of scraps of aluminum. You may also find a few other pics of plane parts that were purportedly found at the Pentagon...but the Pentagon is absent from those pictures.</p>

<p>You see, there should be thousands of pictures and videos showing the plane. There are none.</p>

<p>&quot;Vaporize.&quot;  In the real world---the world we live in---massive planes don&#39;t turn into a vapor.  Of course, we have free will, and that shithead on facebook is welcome to believe whatever stupid bee ess he wants to believe in order to hang on to the lie.  But it&#39;s still a lie.</p>

<p>You have difficulty paying attention it seems. </p>

<p>The title of the video is <em>&quot;F4 Phantom Jet Hits Concrete Wall at 500 MPH&quot;</em></p>

<p>NOT, F4 Jet hits wall at max speed of 1470mph. </p>

<hr/>

<p>But that&#39;s not the point. The point being that it is possible to vaporize something given sufficient forces at play. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>An official (government employed?) photographer was somehow standing in the no man&#39;s land between the Pentagon building and the expressway and was ready to take this photo so soon that the flames hadn&#39;t even had time to become flame shaped. He apparently already had a tripod set up and was ready to get a professional photo of the event, which just happened to be  best viewed from exactly where he happened to be waiting, unmolested by security.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/scXI5v3">http://imgur.com/scXI5v3</a></p>

<p>Regardless of the quickness with which that photo was taken, in it there is already, absolutely no indication that there was a plane crash</p>

<p>By the way that&#39;s this plane,  which has 9ft. tall engines under it&#39;s wings and they apparently were made of Nerf material because they didn&#39;t make any mark anywhere when they hit.</p>

<p>The Flight 77 plane, tail number N644AA </p>

<p>TIL no media agency in the history of mankind has ever used amateur footage of photos in their news stories. Never ever evah4eva. </p>

<p>A photo being clear doesn&#39;t = Tripod or pro. You&#39;ve never used a camera? </p>

<p>The photo also isn&#39;t level. But you don&#39;t need to use a tripod to make a photo level. You just need to.. You know... use your eyes through the viewfinder and look at things to line up with? </p>
