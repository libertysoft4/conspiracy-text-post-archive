    <div class="md"><p>Schizophrenic. They are schozophrenic. I don&#39;t call them crazy, I call them mentally ill. It&#39;s a nicer way of letting people know they are delusional. </p>

<p>Have you ever watched the videos gang0stalking victims post online? They are always accusing people who are just doing their jobs in the community, as being in on the gang-stalking. The mail man, the pizza delivery guy, the cop sitting at a speed trap. All of these people going about their day are all in on this conspiracy to monitor the actions of a lunatic who only leaves the house to make videos of all the people who are stalking them. Gang stalking is not real. It is a paranoid delusion. If you are being monitored by a law enforcement agency, it is called &quot;surveillance&quot;, and that is real. Ask someone who thinks they are being gang stalked two simple questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Why would a group of individuals waste their time watching you? </p></li>
<li><p>Have you been assessed by a mental health professional?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>You will get a blank stare back, because the person who thinks they are being gang stalked cannot rationally answer these questions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I put a stop to it.  And it will appear as a mental illness to anyone whom has never experienced it.  In fact some of the videos you speak of online may very well be mentally ill.  Once i put a stop to it.  No paranoia, but did leave me prone to commit violence when backed into a corner.  And i for sure am not a schizophrenic nor am i a paranoid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Targeted possibly due to being involved in certain activities.  I got a gun and shot over one of their heads and continued firing in their direction missing intentionally.  I go over to where they were at when i shot above they head and on the ground was a little black pouch containing a hearing aid looking device that when turned on would  not amplify sound at all.  I do not know for sure what the device is.  I suspect since it looks like a hearing aid it was a communicating device.  Once they realized i was going to do a head shot the next time,  which i left a note where the black pouch was explaining that.  It completly stopped.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry for the delayed response. After reading your comments on this thread I felt as if I needed a shower. So where were we? You were questioning my level of education. Well sir I can assure you that ive yet to aquire such a distinguished degree, in...what was it, art? Pardon me for assuming but I figured someone holding such a title would be less inclined to compare gun calibers but I guess its too be said that just because you hold a degree, it doesnt make you a wise person. The level of maturaty, or lack of, in your responses says worlds about where your head is at. Work on yourself sir before suggesting that others do the same.</p>
