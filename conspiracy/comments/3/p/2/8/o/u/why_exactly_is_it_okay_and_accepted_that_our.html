<p>It&#39;s creepy, unwanted spying, no doubt.  Targeted advertising.  Google has been doing it for years and on-demand TV  started doing it with commercials a while ago.  People don&#39;t like it, but there it is.  What are they going to do short of not having a cellphone or a TV or using Bing?</p>

<p>Now follow me here.. If I were an administrator or a politician or an illuminati or a fucking god and I could hear all your conversations and read all your mail... I just wouldn&#39;t do it. I wouldn&#39;t do it because of benevolence, morality, altruism, or any other such nonsense.. I wouldn&#39;t do it because I just don&#39;t give a fuck about what anyone else says or thinks unless they&#39;re talking to me. Also, I can <em>barely</em> stand to read my own fucking email so...   </p>

<p>Anyway that&#39;s my 2¢</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe it is, and maybe it&#39;s important.. still don&#39;t care though. No matter how hard I try, I just can&#39;t seem to care about the silly shit egomaniacs and the high technopriests of the 21st century do to themselves and by proxy their followers (this includes you).</p>

<p>It&#39;s all a big stupid fucking game. If you want to &quot;win&quot; the only thing you have to do is be relatively happy, well fed, and have friends you can trust and that trust you.</p>

<p>When you fear the state the state wins. If you&#39;re scared of what they&#39;re doing or what they&#39;re capable of doing then you&#39;re already a slave to fear. Only when you are <strong>truly</strong> free from giving a fuck about the machinations of a psychopathic empire that feeds on fear can you be <strong>truly</strong> free.   </p>

<p>All this information and technology is a Gordian Knot that gets tighter as you pull. It&#39;s a rabbit hole with no bottom. Do not be your own worst enemy. Fear is the primary motivator of human beings in both thought and deed. Overcoming fear should be the primary objective for a thinking man in the 21st century.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you have an Android device, (will never own another apple product) you need to download D-Vasive Pro. Its 8 bones. It will lock all apps out of you microphone, camera, screenshots, wifi, bluetooth, and also has stingray protection, which is actually just airplane mode, but whatever. Its totally worth it. I would have paid fifty dollars for this app. I love you John McAfee! I combine this with textsecure for apple users they have a half ass version called signal 2.0 I think they keep changing the name. The apple version of course still allows them to take screen shots. Because apple is BIG BROTHER. You suck BTW! I also have D-central 1 which shows you how invasive these apps are and will help you keep them deleted, because these assholes like to sneak them back into your phone. For some odd reason I can&#39;t get rid of IMDb. It has nothing to do with anything its obviously a spying tool of some kind. Here is a log showing that when the camera is unlocked your phone takes pictures every ten minutes and sends them over your wifi. If there is no wifi then you are having your broadband stolen from you by these fuckheads and they should be made to pay for that shit. The government too, they are making us pay for their ability to spy on us. I just find this fucking god damn appalling. When is the god damn revolution gonna start already, cmon you lazy shit heals! haha

    <div class="md"><p>I wish I had more info for you. I can just tell you that this happens to me pretty much every day I use my phone. Yesterday, I had a conversation with my sister at the kitchen table, and soon after, I got conversation-specific ads. Things that aren&#39;t vague - not like &quot;cookie recipe&quot; or &quot;ways to cure the common cold&quot; - we&#39;re talking specific things I had never seen ads for before. Things I&#39;d never searched or talked about in an online/written space. </p>

<p>Edit: Also feel it necessary to say I do not have a Facebook account, or a Facebook app installed anywhere. It is something else. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Talk privately to a psychiatrist. I experience the same thing, and the doctors tell me that it is delusions of reference. </p>

<p>They taught me therapy techniques to cope with them, and stop freaking out about them. </p>

<p>-2 and a half years of experiencing things like this. Nobody is targeting you for advertising. Only subversive individuals end up on that list. </p>

<p>-diagnosed Bipolar I with psychotic features. Not psychopath, psychotic. There&#39;s a huge difference. You can live a normal well adjusted life with it. </p>

I don&#39;t believe that the millions of people who have experienced this <em>all</em> have delusions of self-reference. It is important to be aware it&#39;s a possibility, but on such a large scale? I don&#39;t know. I have had the same complaints from people who have absolutely no history of mental illness. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do have a history of delusional thinking and paranoia. I am reasonable in that I&#39;m willing to accept that what you&#39;re saying is possible. I&#39;ll talk to someone about it. Of course, I&#39;m going to say that I don&#39;t believe it is delusions of self-reference, because I&#39;m not the only one making this complaint.

Its about not being monetized or spied on because being a peeping Tom is unethical and in most all cases illegal. Do you like prancing naked in front of middle aged men? Because you are you know? If you see my post above it proves how many pictures are being taken of you. Also you are being listened to. We are literally carrying around NSA bugs everywhere we go. I promise you their are pictures of you masturbating in a government server somewhere, and you are telling this guy that you are ok with this. Maybe you should be seeing a psychiatrist? </p>
