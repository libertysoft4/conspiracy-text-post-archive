    <div class="md"><p>Folks, notice how it resorts to this silly name-calling and ad-hom: &quot;vast ignorance in your thinking, making an ass out of yourself, so sad, little one.&quot;</p>

<p>Remember, we&#39;re dealing with someone who is quoting Lenin ... freaking Lenin ... approvingly, and seems to believe &quot;fascism&quot; means &quot;bad things&quot; - and doesn&#39;t even understand the actual relationship between capitalism and fascism.</p>

<p>Any one want to bet it couldn&#39;t even begin to describe the historical circumstances of Mussolini&#39;s Italy or Franco&#39;s Spain?</p>

<p>It&#39;s ok to laugh now, since Communism is completely discredited and these looney-tunes aren&#39;t taken seriously outside of their Marxist student groups, but god help us if these nuts ever got power again. Remember what happened last time - hundreds of millions dead, gulaged, and oppressed.</p>

<p>No. It&#39;s just a pity how people don&#39;t have a clue what &quot;fascism&quot; really was. The USA and GB are nothing even close to &quot;fascist&quot; - they are internationalist, not nationalist, they are oligarchical, not populist, and they are imperialist, not inward-looking.</p>

<p>So, no, nothing even close to fascist.</p>

<p>One more time, in English please.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Eh, I think it&#39;s fair to call Trump a &quot;populist&quot; - calling Trump a &quot;fascist&quot; would be stupid, though.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who says fascists are not imperialists, seems to me that Nazis had a pretty well defined wish for an empire.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most fascist movements were nationalist, not imperialist. Communism was, of course, the definition of imperialist. Remember, Stalin was considered a &quot;traitor to Communism&quot; for his idea of &quot;socialism in one country&quot; instead of a &quot;world wide Communist revolution.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>only has this part of the quote: &quot;Nothing outside the state&quot;.</p>

<p>It then &quot;interprets&quot; that to mean &quot;The country must grow and the implied goal of any fascist nation is to rule the world, and have every human submit to the government.&quot; - which doesn&#39;t appear to be something that Mussolini actually said.</p>

<p>So, can you clarify if that is an actual quote from Mussolini, or if that is just someone &quot;interpreting&quot; it?</p>

<p>Because &quot;Nothing outside the state&quot; does NOT imply &quot;The country must grow and the implied goal of any fascist nation is to rule the world, and have every human submit to the government.&quot;</p>

<p>EDIT: In fact, it doesn&#39;t appear that Mussolini said that, at all.</p>

<p>Interesting, then, that Italy and Spain - the two major examples of fascism (Hitler was his own special brand of something) were about the least imperialist of the Great Powers.</p>

<p>Certainly, the USA and the USSR were far more imperialist than either Germany or Italy and far more than Spain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely agree... It is like users comparing colonial and neocolonial conditions, calling them the same.  It is disingenuous, and takes the true brutality away from &#39;colonialism&#39;.  Essentially, this deceitful form of comparison erases history, making abhorrent historical conditions seem equal to that of current conditions.  Further, this dishonest tool of contrast is often used to incite aggressive reactions against societal norms, and the human&#39;s that represent them.</p>

<hr/>

<p>That kind of dishonest movement toward change is more dangerous than our current power structure.  The revolution must be honest and peaceful.  The truth stands as a minority.</p>
