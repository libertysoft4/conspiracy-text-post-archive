<p>As the title says, lets pretend for a second to be asked to expose the biggest conspiracy of mankind, you would need proves that could convince you about the truthfulness of the evidence and be strong enough to be used as evidence to others, What those evidence would be? considering how internet have made all those &quot;evidence&quot; quite objectionable, what would truly convince you?</p>

<p>EDIT: to clarify the conspiracy can be on earth already you need evidence they are between us, not only on other planets.</p>

The shadow govt is all over misinformation on banned substances and have used this misinformation to turn the USA into a police state.

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;ve tested ayahuasca and DMT though,  same with like 90% of the psychedelics, LSD, shrooms, all that, none of it can kill you, none of it has lasting physical effects. It can be harmful in that if you took enough the experience could be so intense that it drives you off the deep end and makes you question everything about reality and you end up going crazy, but if you&#39;re not already a bit crazy, and you&#39;re careful with your dosage, it can be very beneficial. Psychedelics are going to be the next thing that is legalized I bet, at least in clinical situations and for therapy. Check out this study on psilocybin mushrooms, which are closely related to DMT:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen a few things.  One time I was in a house purported to be haunted.  I saw this object out of the corner of my eye while playing with a dog.  The object started out of thin air at like six feet and fell to the ground.  Went to inspect and it was a very old, dusty and grimy porcelain statuette of a doll baby.  Nobody living in the house had ever seen it before.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve definitely felt some presences, especially in the furnace room of a hacienda in Mexico.  </p>

<p>You should read some experiences before you &quot;drug&quot; this experience away.  There is indication that entheogenic substances are the root of human consciousness.  Think evolution for the brain expansion coming from our ancestors ingesting mushrooms, cactus, or South American barks and vines.  </p>

<p>What notion makes you think substances cannot facilitate contact beyond this world besides a social stigmatism?  Shamanic cultures believe this wholeheartedly, O well traveled and encultured one.  Western culture never ceases to amaze me with its judgements based on nothing except ignorance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess I&#39;m beating a dead horse with the &quot;drug&quot; thing but you really can&#39;t tell me that you&#39;ve experienced what I&#39;m talking about &quot;because I&#39;ve done drugs&quot;.  This is not an &quot;I&#39;m impaired, I&#39;m fucked up haha&quot; experience.  No sir.  You leave your body behind IMMEDIATELY.  To anyone watching you it appears you are asleep for 5-10 minutes.  There is no drug, acid, mushrooms, peyote or anything that even comes close to the experience.</p>

<p>It can be absolutely terrifying.  You see things your mind just can&#39;t make up.  Imagine the direct work and language of the gods!  Infinite detail, melding and contorting in ways beyond human expression.   It reminds me of some sort of cosmic coding of the essence of energy.  But then entities come into this space.  They examine you and your soul.  They show you alien scenes and guide you from place to place in their realm.  They have strange machinery that they love to show you.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen beings that look a lot like beings from eastern and shamanic religions mostly, which is of note since these religions and cultures have used these substances for thousands of years.  </p>

<p>I hope readers will research this if they&#39;ve never heard of what I&#39;m talking about.  You can start with the documentary &#39;spirit molecule&#39; on netflix.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you need someone else to convince you? If it waa really a belief you have then what does it matter what anyone else thinks?</p>

<p>People always say proof but are quick to dismiss it in anyway they can. Like religion. I feel religion is the oldest form of control. I understand that many want to believe their life has a purpose because they can&#39;t accept they are just here. </p>

<p>You want a sobering reality check? Write your own obituary. List you accomplishments and defeats. Something you would find fitting to be read at your death. I had to do this on submarines. I realized life isn&#39;t a race to do something worth while. </p>

<p>Life is a race to die. That may sound dismal but really it isn&#39;t. Death is the greatest pleasure in life that is why its so peaceful. </p>

<p>The belief in extraterrestrials is odd to me as well. Who says they are not already here? They came here so long ago and intermingled with humans that we wouldn&#39;t know them if we saw them. </p>

<p>Also the idea that aliens would travel so far to destroy us is crazy to me. With a race that can travel the cosmos comes rationality as well as respect for other life forms. They would attempt to work with us for coesxitance. Not domination.</p>

<p>I want to be an optimist because I am a father. So do or don&#39;t that&#39;s you choice when you ask for proof you are asking someone to make you mind up for you and giving up your own influence to control your life. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was reading a book called the strain the otherday, its about vampires but what struck me was a line the old vampire hunter told the new doctor, he said somthing to the effect that some knowlage has to be revield over time not explained but experienced to understand. I think this is the trap all conspiracy uses to stay hidden, i dont think any amount of evidence will convince people. unless they are shown and experiance the knowledge first hand and even then most people will hold fast to ego and reject reality lol.</p>

<p>As a Skeptic, What inconfutable proof would be needed to convince anybody of a Alien/extra dimensional beings conspiracy? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;d need to prove extra dimensions, prove they&#39;re amenable to something we could identify as life, prove that such life has the capability to become sentient, prove that we&#39;ve known all of the previous and not widely disseminated such info. </p>

<p>Then you have to prove whatever the conspiracy about it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you guys are giving lots of ideas, but are getting a bit out of rail from my original question, i will try to formulate a bit better.</p>

<p>Pretend you are near to expose a conspiracy, you are in the position to put your hands on evidences which can be enough powerful to silence any skeptic, what those evidences would have to look like (if you already believe you would not need probably further profs).</p>
