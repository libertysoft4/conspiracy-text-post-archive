<p>I&#39;m not sure what your ideas on religion or God are; as for myself, in this context I don&#39;t feel my view&#39;s are relevant.  Rather, I submitted this quote [in it&#39;s entirety] because it is from one of the Founding Fathers of the United States.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was demonstrating that I did know the difference between attending church and having faith.  </p>

<p>Jefferson is the only one of the Founding Fathers one could reasonably assume to be atheist, but it is just as likely that he enjoyed blasphemy just for the sake of angering large institutions (as there was not a political entity of any kind he didn&#39;t try to take down a peg).  Either way, I would argue that it was not central to Jefferson&#39;s principals.  It is possible that is the case with Madison as well, as the two were very close in views, though I am still learning more about Madison.</p>

<p>The majority seemed to be Deists, believing in some form of higher power, but having broken with Christianity for various reasons.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, I feel that we are being sold this idea of religious wars happening so that we hopefully don&#39;t find out that the wars are really being fought for resources, drugs, and land. Even though people were taught (or used to be taught) that most wars in history were over material wealth, they choose to believe modern wars are being fought for ideological reasons.

Additionally, both the President and the main &quot;rebel&quot; group were both Zaidi Shia.  Now that Saudi and Iran are heavily involved, it has become more Sunni vs Shia, but that was not the initial case.</p>

<p>They tell of an experiment which “claims to be able to make Christians no longer believe in God and make Britons open their arms to migrants.” How’s it done? “Using a technique called transcranial magnetic stimulation” researchers can “safely shut down certain groups of neurones” in the brain.</p>

<p>It seems to have worked. Volunteers were coaxed into having their brains zapped by giant magnets. And, lo! “Belief in God was reduced almost by a third, while participants became 28.5 per cent less bothered by immigration numbers.”</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry you feel I am, &quot;downvoting every opinion that doesn&#39;t glorify faith&quot;.  As a result of this, it seems you view this dialogue as scored with bias...  Obviously, your comments have been unfairly scored; <em>your ideas are brilliant, they should be upvoted and number one right?</em></p>

<hr/>

<p>What is much more likely, is my suggestions are sapient, and being upvoted for their merit.</p>

<hr/>

<p><em>Also, I appreciate you u/MurrueLaFlaga, for pointing out the ridiculous nature of u/kckolbe&#39;s comments.  Aren&#39;t we allowed to vote?  Isn&#39;t that part of what makes Reddit great?</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>All I can disagree with is that it is part of what <em>did</em> make Reddit great. Now, it seems, shadowbanning, vote manipulation, and outright banning of &quot;shocking and offensive material&quot; is the norm on Reddit. Thankfully, it isn&#39;t always that way on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and the other subs I frequent (I can&#39;t deal with the default subs). Votes are designed to imply merit, as you correctly stated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have absolutely no way to prove that the OP has been downvoting every comment they disagree with, and you seem to be ignoring that other users are in here, also downvoting some comments because those comments have less than zero as their score, which requires more than one downvote.</p>
