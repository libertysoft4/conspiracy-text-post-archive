    <div class="md"><p>I caight the excerpts cnn showed on their roku channel.</p>

<p>What is noticed was the democrats spent all their time saying that it was a prosecution  instead of the democrat committee memebers actually taking the time to learn more to actually find things out that wpuld be helpful to the diplomatoc core in the future. Ironicly the democrats took up all their speaking time saying that, thus being guilty of the wasted opportunity they accused republicans of.</p>

<p>I am no hillary hater on bengazi.</p>

<p>I dislike her because she is a wallstreet puppet like bush.
My dislike is non partisan.
 But if youre going to have her there stopping crying about it being a prosecution and just ask some relevant questions to learn something in a none  prosecutorial way. </p>

<p>One thing i did learn is the the diplomats who died had gone to a cia saferoom in the annex which was designed to keep them secure. Howeve rthe safe room (rather unbeleivably to me)  did not seal the air and provide air so when the attackers lit the place up with deisel fuel they were not harmed or burned but had to evacuate becuase of the smoke.  They were then overcome with smoke as they tried to escape through the thick smoke oitside to tue roof with a cia guy leading the way. The cia guy wnet back through tje smoke to find the two diplomats and dragged one to the roof but couldnt find chris. Chris the main diplomate was later found by freindly libyans who took him to the hospital and the doctors tried to revive him for 2 hours.</p>

<p>That was relevant and important info.  </p>

<p>Again i am not  a hillqry hater on bengazi.</p>

<p>But the committee clearly uncovered important info about it all and stil are. To say otherwise is silly. And theyhave 20 more witnesses.  Its stupid if they have spent 4 million for the democrats to then try to complakn while the main witness is there . You spent the money so now take the time to ask questions of the top level witness hillary.</p>

<p>The other interesting tjing was a committee member complained this was being invedtigated more than 9/11 was investigated. I agree. The lck of investigation into 9/11 was appalling. We all know why.  However i suggest that since they recognize that that they now actually do  REAL 9/11 investigation now that Bush and Cheney areout of office and can&#39;t hinder it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dodnt follow it. As i said i dont care about hillary and this.</p>

<p>I did hear the chairman of the committee with his mohawk hair say that the witnesses they had called and the information the committee had suppeonaed had never ben examoneed previously. </p>

<p>Is that right or wrong? i dont know.</p>

<p>Bit ithink hillary is doing what bush did.</p>

<p>Delay investigation endlessly while refusing to answer questions saying it is under investigation so they cant talk  Then when they can no longer delay, claim that it is all old news and has already been asked and answered!  That seems like what hillary is doing now.</p>

<p>But like i saidd i dont knowand dont really care.  I dont loke hillary beciase she is a wallstreeter and drig company minion and has bad judgement and has never effecticely gotten anything through congrsss like her helathcare debacle in tue 90&#39;s and she is not personable or a good leader.</p>

<p>I dont care what mshe did in bengazi.
.and i feel the same about jeb bush.</p>

<p>I like sanders and trump who sremore alike than people think.</p>

<p>I think Trump has one or two good points (about a border fence, and about money in politics), but mostly he&#39;s a dangerous know-nothing.  He seems to think that tough talk can force other countries to do what we want.  He denies science on vaccines and climate change.  He has no experience in govt, so would make many elementary and expensive mistakes.  He&#39;s avoided being specific, which has been working for him so far, but most of the electorate will see him for what he is when we get further along in the process.</p>
