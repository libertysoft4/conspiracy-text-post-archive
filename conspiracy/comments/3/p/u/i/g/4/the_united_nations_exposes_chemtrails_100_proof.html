    <div class="md"><p>You underestimate the complexity of flying into an air corridor.</p>

<p>You&#39;d need an airplane that&#39;s pressurized (air corridors are 8 - 12 kms above the surface).</p>

<p>You need an approval to fly in the corridor.</p>

<p>Not sure about the instruments that would be needed, I suspect it goes into tens of thousands of dollars (equipment + installation). You&#39;d probably need a couple of approvals for installing those instruments as well.</p>

<p>etc.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t just fly into one, effectively tailing a commercial flight and hope for the best. You&#39;d probably get shot down by a military jet if you attempted to do it out of a whim.</p>

<p>I suspect it would be easier to get a weather balloon to cross a path of a commercial plane, or maybe constructing a solid fuel rocket, but damn, you&#39;d probably get into a world of pain if that was done without approvals. Obviously the act of getting permits would alarm any agency that runs the chemtrails, so that you&#39;d end up with no results.</p>

<p>I know that chemtrails advocates have utterly failed to show any connection between hair/blood samples and chemtrails, have notably (and suspiciously) failed to take the obvious step of collecting direct samples, can&#39;t agree on who is spraying, why they are doing it, or even what is being sprayed, and won&#39;t acknowledge that the number of passenger air-kilometers per year has <a href="http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/interactive/2014/07/travel/aviation-data/media/images/chart_04.jpg">increased about 500%</a> in the past 30 years. </p>

<p>And yes, it will take more than another shitty YouTube video of anecdotal &quot;claims&quot; to convince me otherwise. What about testimony from one of the tens of thousands of people needed to operate this world-wide program over the decades it has allegedly been running?</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there is work being done on geoengineering/weather modification, but I&#39;m more inclined to look at projects like HAARP. Any weather changes resulting from contrails - and that is what Rosalind Peterson is ACTUALLY discussing - are incidental. </p>

<p>Have you seen WITWATS?  Dr. David Keith <strong>SPECIFICALLY</strong> says that aluminum has 4 times the reflective surface area per volume than any other material they can put into the air.</p>

<p>See, you know what we have here?  You have an opinion, and I have one as well.  I have huge concerns with these connections, and you&#39;re happy as a clam to claim there can be ZERO connection.  As if you can somehow know better!</p>

<p>Geoengineers talk about this specifically and your opinion/bias keeps you thinking it can only be pollution because that is what you&#39;re comfortable with. </p>

<p>Roselind doesn&#39;t say there is no evidence for chemtrails, she specifically stated she has evidence that rocket programs have been dumping trimethyl aluminum into the atmosphere.  She simple won&#39;t get behind anything because she doesn&#39;t believe there is sufficient facts on paper evidence to proceed with some kind of lawsuit.  You don&#39;t have to speak for her, she knows what going on and just currently doesn&#39;t have the hard facts to prove it comes from planes.  That&#39;s OK, because she is not the only source.  That&#39;s what she&#39;s concerned with and you don&#39;t have to make it seem like she is not on board.</p>

<p>See, it&#39;s good to talk to people like you.  Not because this post is actually for you.  The more people who read this who are on the fence will see the difference between being apathetic and ignoring what has already been said by geoengineers, and looking up and seeing the obviousness of the sky above them.  Ignoring those people in Arizona like you have, essentially claiming their testing is fiction or fraudulent to support your <em>opinion</em> is beyond disingenuous.  You don&#39;t have anything to refute their claims except your opinion.</p>

<p>Dr. David Keith......4 times the reflective surface area per volume......address it.  <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/geoengineering-could-turn-skies-white/">Global dimming, turning our skies whiter....a geoengineering process.</a></p>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes, let&#39;s see what Dr. David Keith SPECIFICALLY says on the topic of chemtrails. The following are all <strong>direct quotes</strong> from <a href="http://www.keith.seas.harvard.edu/chemtrails/">his website</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;I have not seen any credible evidence that chemtrails exist.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;I am very confident that there is no currently active program to actually test or implement geoengineering outdoors.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof. The claim that there is a large-scale secret program to spray materials from aircraft is extraordinary. Yet all the evidence I have seen to date has been very weak.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>So, the first man whose work you cite in support of chemtrails... <em>doesn&#39;t actually think they exist</em>. Address <strong>that</strong>....</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yet, the title on this post by a chemtrailer is &quot;The United Nations Exposes Chemtrails: 100% PROOF,&quot; Almost entirely nonsense. This goes to show how weak the real case for chemtrails is: its supporters need to fabricate and distort facts to try and support it. </p>

<p>S&#39;funny, chemtrailers never mention <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOXt0BTOTN0">this video</a> by Peterson, in which she says, &quot;In ten years of research, other than aluminum coated fiberglass, chaff releases by the US Military, I have no proof whatsoever that the jets are releasing anything but jet fuel emissions... <strong>I don&#39;t have a single study, I don&#39;t have a single solitary verifiable evidence that the jets are releasing anything</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>So, another frequently cited &quot;supporter&quot; of chemtrails doesn&#39;t actually believe in them either! Address <strong>that</strong>...</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I do genuinely appreciate your willingness to engage in a debate, and that&#39;s more than many have done - usually, by now, I&#39;ve been called a &quot;shill&quot; for demanding objective evidence of the phenomena. But what you are doing is something I see quite often here: taking Case A, and extrapolating it as &quot;proof&quot; of X, Y and Z. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like the people who cite Operation Northwoods as evidence that the Boston Bombing was a hoax, failing to realize that they are entirely different things. A NASA rocket experiment or a theoretical concept offer absolutely no evidence for the existence of chemtraiils as they are claimed: The same goes for the people in Arizona. They fail completely to prove <em>any connection</em> to any atmospheric phenomena. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dr. David Keith......4 times the reflective surface area per volume......address it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, apart from the fact Dr. Keith himself doesn&#39;t believe in chemtrails, you omit the fact there&#39;s one other thing aluminum does very, very well. It&#39;s the main component of the chaff countermeasure used by military craft to confuse radar-guided missiles. Chemtrails, if they contain aluminum in the amount claimed, should light up on radar like a frickin&#39; Christmas tree. Yet that doesn&#39;t seem to be happening at all. </p>

<p>Address <strong>that</strong>....</p>

<p>I agree, there&#39;s little hope in convincing a &quot;True Believer&quot; their views are incorrect. But I think anyone stumbling across this topic will realize that the evidence confirms what Dr. Keith and Rosalind Peterson have both EXPLICTLY said. Which is basically that chemtrails, as they are alleged, simply do not exist. </p>

<p>You&#39;re running on the ragged edge of your argument here.  Remember a lawsuit failed to net anything related to &quot;chemtrails&quot; because they don&#39;t recognize that as their term.  </p>

<p>Wrong, yet again. As I already quoted him, Keith says, &quot;I am very confident that there is no currently active program to actually test or implement <strong>geoengineering</strong> outdoors.&quot; And you have completely failed to prove otherwise, offering absolutely zero evidence of any such program being carried out. </p>

<p>Oh, look. Yet another purely theoretical concept with no actual basis in fact.  What a surprise. </p>

<p>You have had your ass soundly kicked in this &quot;debate&quot; - I use quotes, because only one of us has been providing any actual facts, and it isn&#39;t you. You should probably quit before you embarrass yourself any further with your continued inability to distinguish science fiction from fact. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>YOu cited David Keith....a geoengineer who wants to put chemicals into the sky to reflect radiation back into space just like the IPCC says it wants to.....</p>

<p>They personally don&#39;t call it chemtrails because that&#39;s our term that people use because this kind of thing is not on anyone&#39;s radar, yet.</p>

<p>You&#39;re running on the ragged edge of your argument here.  Remember a lawsuit failed to net anything related to &quot;chemtrails&quot; because they don&#39;t recognize that as their term.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s like cheesy lawyer tricks.  Legaleese.  They claim they don&#39;t know anything about it when they&#39;re funding the issue but call it something else.</p>

<p>Have you heard of SRM before?</p>

<p>Wrong, yet again. As I already quoted him, Keith says, &quot;I am very confident that there is no currently active program to actually test or implement <strong>geoengineering</strong> outdoors.&quot; And you have completely failed to prove otherwise, offering absolutely zero evidence of any such program being carried out. </p>

<p>Oh, look. Yet another purely theoretical concept with no actual basis in fact.  What a surprise. </p>

<p>You have had your ass soundly kicked in this &quot;debate&quot; - I use quotes, because only one of us has been providing any actual facts, and it isn&#39;t you. You should probably quit before you embarrass yourself any further with your continued inability to distinguish science fiction from fact. </p>
