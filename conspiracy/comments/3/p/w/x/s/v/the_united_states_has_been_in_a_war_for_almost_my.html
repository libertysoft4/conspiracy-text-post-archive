<p>I was born in the early 90s and vaguely remember 9/11. Ever since then, this country has been in some sort of active military operation. This is incredible and I&#39;m not sure many other people my age (or many people of any age) understands the gravity of this fact. This is outrageous to me, and I honestly feel like there&#39;s nothing I can do about it. What&#39;s it going to take for this to change?</p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t sure where else to post this because again, people my age don&#39;t care about this stuff. Was it like this before the 90s?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am an old woman and I&#39;ve had a lot of sugar, so pardon the rambling.  </p>

<p>I was a teenager in the 1980s.  At that time, the Berlin Wall was still up, the Cold War was still very chilly.  Russia was a giant mysterious bloc of states populated by action movie villains, Bond femme fatales and hard core Communists bent on world domination.  The movie, Red Dawn (the original) came out and the idea of Russia invading the US wasn&#39;t so far fetched.  The US and Russia were stockpiling nuclear weapons and events like 3 Mile Island (1970&#39;s) and Chernobyl made us legitimately fearful of a serious nuclear accident or conflict happening in our lifetime.  At school we practiced Nuclear drills where we were told to &quot;duck and cover&quot; under our desks as if that would save us from anything.  Movies like <em>Testament</em> and <em>The Day After</em> portrayed a fallen nation poisoned by radiation and starving to death with no hope for survival.  A good portion of people my age expected WW3 within their lifetime.  </p>

<p>When the hostages were released from Iran on the day President Reagan was inaugurated, people were ecstatic!  Reagan was the man!  He was the cowboy that was going to pull us out of the foreign policy humiliations Carter allowed. No one was going to fuck with Reagan.  The military beefed up, the economy picked up things went smoothly for a while.  </p>

<p>And then we started a slow slide toward the Middle East.  One of our ships shot down an Iranian Civilian Air Liner.<br/>
Mind you, we were super upset about it.  &quot;How could such an accident happen?!&quot;  The media blamed it on the Iranians for using an improper IFF code.  In fact, the air liner had the right code, but some poor schmuck pressed the wrong button and .....more than 200 civilians died.  Unforgivable, in my view now.  A tragic accident I didn&#39;t much want to think about then.  I was too busy feathering my bangs.</p>

<p>I am simplifying.</p>

<p>The news showed footage of terror attacks daily. I mean bloody floors and walls, limbs strewn across marketplaces, crumbled buildings. Terrorists bombed the Marine barracks in Beirut, a civilian air liner was bombed over Lockerbie Scotland (reportedly by Libyans, but who knows?).  We were furious, but for the most part, Arabs and Arab terrorists were a joke.  Note, the villains in the opening scenes of Back to the Future were Libyan terrorists who sold Doc some plutonium.  </p>

<p>Hijackings were a thing.  Every few months some crazy asshole would strap on a bomb belt and demand to be taken somewhere - Russia, Cuba, Iran....the army of whatever country they were in would surround the plane and then talk the hijackers out, or negotiate until they had an opportunity to kill them.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t remember a time between 1980 and 1990 where I was afraid of a terror attack.  Hijackings and bombings (they happened too, mostly in the Middle East, but in Europe as well and in the UK, the IRA was still fighting Britain).  They were just things you dealt with and moved on.  We hated it, but we accepted it as a part of life.  A part of life far removed from the capitalist Utopia of America in the 80&#39;s.  That sort of thing happened &quot;over there.&quot;</p>

<p>Then Iraq invaded Kuwait.  WW3!  We were all convinced the end was near!  Jihad!  Holy War!  Armageddon.</p>

<p>Nope. We got a few nights of television watching shit blow up and then it became obvious Iraq was no challenge to the might of the United States of America.  The war was over in 6 weeks.  We came home, patted ourselves on the back and then set up a few strategic bases in the Middle East and started bossing everyone around. </p>

<p>Huge mistake.  In 1993 the WTC was bombed the first time.  We shrugged it off, captured the bad guy and let him rot in a Federal prison after a &quot;fair&quot; trial. A trial at least.  Fairness is debatable, but unlike those poor bastards at Gitmo, at least that fanatical blind goat fucker has some closure.  </p>

<p>In hindsight, the idea that some bit of legislation was going to protect us after 9/11, is ludicrous!  But, fear makes you forget a lot of things and common sense is the first to go.  How do you look at pictures of people jumping from burning towers and say, &quot;No, we don&#39;t need a more comprehensive counter-intelligence plan - &quot;  When the smoke cleared, America was furious!  We wanted to blow some shit up!  Saddam Hussein was a convenient target, because America needed a win.  </p>

<p>Now, full disclosure, I&#39;m a Navy veteran, married to a Navy veteran and we both served in the first Gulf War. I was a flag waving, yellow ribbon hanging, God Bless the USA singing patriot after the first Gulf War.  USA ALL THE WAY.  </p>

<p>I got to meet Ted Nugent and he told me I was a goddam hero for delivering the mail for six weeks while we kicked the shit out of a country barely out of the Industrial Age.  Wow.  You beat up the retarded kid, America.  Way to go.</p>

<p>As patriotic as I was then, I&#39;ll admit now our post 9/11 policies were a complete failure.  You can&#39;t hide from danger.  You can&#39;t prevent it, you can&#39;t predict it.  You pick yourself up and you move along.  Just like we did after all the hijackings, the bombings in the preceding 20 years.  </p>

<p>My only hope is that others my age feel the same way and that they will run for office, vote and make policy that restores the US to what it was - a prosperous nation capable of kicking anybody&#39;s ass, but doesn&#39;t need to.  Or want to.  </p>

<p>Edit:  Crap that&#39;s long.  Sorry guys.  </p>

<p>Is it supposed to be some sort of justification, like &quot;<em>Well gosh, everyone keeps volunteering for the military, so it must be the right thing to do.  And it would be a shame for all these volunteers to go to waste, so we&#39;d better give them something to do and keep them busy</em>&quot;?</p>

<p>I really don&#39;t see how Balthanos&#39; comment had any relevance to the topic to begin with.  Many of Hitler&#39;s Waffen SS joined &quot;voluntarily&quot;.  So what?  Regardless of how our militaries have filled out their ranks, we&#39;re still a warmongering nation.</p>
