<p>There were several discussions going on yesterday on <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> on how the <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/38if2e/us_air_force_targets_and_destroys_isis_hq/">ISIS selfie</a> story was just misdirection by US Intelligence to cover their source.</p>

<p><a href="/u/thehitmaniptf">/u/thehitmaniptf</a> brought up a piece of dialogue from the recent movie &quot;The Imitation Game&quot; which describes the concept better...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ALAN : We’ll require a believable alternate source for each piece of information we use.</p>

<p>JOAN : A false story that exlains how we got that information, that has nothing to do with Enigma. And then you’ll need to leak those stories to the Germans.</p>

<p>ALAN : And the rest of our military.</p>

<p>JOAN: Can you do that?</p>

<p>STEWART : Maintain a conspiracy of lies through the highest levels of our government? Yes, that sounds right up my alley.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anything and everything relating to the collapse of towers on 9/11. While conspiracy types obsess about nano-thermite and molten steel, the real secret no-one wants to pay attention to, is <strong>who organized 9/11.</strong></p>

<p>Personally I suspect the CIA to have cooked the whole thing up, using some helpful terrorist &quot;assets&quot; they had handy. The CIA has long planned executing terror attacks against its own people to push its agenda forward, with examples like Operations Northwoods and Gladio in the past.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Judy Wood in an interesting character. She seems to be well-credentialed, and well-spoken, yet her conclusions seem to discredit all of that.</p>

<p>One piece of evidence that she cites is the wtc &quot;spire&quot; that turned to dust, which is quite compelling and inexplicable.</p>

<p>However, she may be a distraction from other theories and evidence, such as the mini-nukes theory which is supported by </p>

<p>1) reports of molten metal &quot;flowing like in a foundry&quot; </p>

<p>2) high temperatures in the basement that lingered for weeks </p>

<p>3) perhaps most damning of all, the obviously recently-molten rock under where one of the WTC once stood, also known as the
 &quot;wtc pot hole&quot;</p>

<p>The &quot;wtc pot hole&quot; also partially-discredits the nano-thermite theory, or to put that another way, the nano-thermite theory doesnt explain the &quot;wtc pot hole&quot;, or the dust-ification of the wtc spire</p>

<p>There may have been nano-thermite to initiate the collapse, but wouldnt even have been necessary with a top-down &quot;progessive collapse&quot;. progressive collapse was rolled out as some new-found phenomenon after 9/11, in spite of the fact that progressive collapse is a tried-and-true, established technique for controlled demolition, and would have been the preferred technique in an <em>overt</em> controlled demolition.</p>

<p>So you start with the controlled demolition, and work your way backward. The airplanes were unnecessary aside from the &quot;war on terror&quot; narrative. Therefore, its almost immaterial whether the airplanes were real or hollywood, as they were only theatrics regardless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Nuclear theory is the most stupid theory I&#39;ve every heard bar the space laser theory, and i&#39;m 80% sure that one is satire.</p>

<p>The simple fact is that if it was nukes that took down the twin towers </p>

<p>A - Everyone in Lower Manhattan would be in serious need of Chemotherapy right about now</p>

<p>B - There would have been a very noticeable shock-wave from the base of the towers, likely taking down nearby buildings</p>

<p>C - There would have been a flash of light bright enough to eclipse the sun for the brief period of Fission</p>

<p>And D- There wouldn&#39;t have been any working electronic devices for a pretty sizable area around Manhattan.</p>

<p>As none of these are true, I&#39;m pretty skeptical about your theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Disagree. People focus on nano thermite and how the buildings collapsed because they &quot;only want to focus on physical proof rather than speculating&quot;.  </p>

<p>I say fuck it, you gotta dig deeper. My 2 years of research have led me to conclude that 9/11 was an operation conducted by an elite fraction of the CIA/NSA/Bush Administration + Saudi Royal Family + Israeli Mossad.  The 28-pages, while holding some truths, will push the blame solely on the Saudi&#39;s and away from Israel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do weigh less at the equator than you do at the poles. It just is a relatively small difference, because the centripetal acceleration is really small. </p>

<p>Centripetal acceleration is given by v<sup>2</sup> /r, where v is the tangential velocity and r is the radius. Tangential velocity works out to be about 1000mph, or about 450 m/s. Using a radius of 6400km, you get an acceleration of about .032 m/s<sup>2</sup> . Given that g is roughly 10 m/s<sup>2</sup> , you would weigh .32% less at the equator.

<li><p>They say that the atmosphere is also suspended in rotation around the earth just like the whole &quot;earth&quot; in its entirety. Apparently gravity keeps it this way. See gravity is not just the force acting downwards on an object, but also the collective force applied to every successive layer above it. This keeps things with relative velocity to each other be exactly 0. I have problems with that but when talking it over with my brother, my brother said he compares the earth rotating as a spinning top, the atmosphere is also locked into this spin. I am leaning more towards the other version where there should be winds and planes should take shorter time flying one way than the other. Anyway, putting this aside for now.</p></li>

<p>Its a feature of relativity. </p>

<p>Its a simple experiment that you can test out yourself: go in a minivan and have someone else drive. Go at like 60 miles an hour or a really high speed. Now see if you could walk to the back of the minivan and then back to the front, and then to the back again. </p>

<p>Because the minivan is moving at extreme speeds, you too are moving at extreme speeds so you are essentially not moving relative to the minivan, and thus you are able to walk back an forth.</p>

<p>Rememeber the earth is massively round, so even moving at really fast speeds, its still moving slow. So while its moving, you and everything else on it is moving along with it. So relative to the earth you are not moving.</p>

<p>And since you raised an unrelated point. I am aware of jet streams but they are not caused solely due to the earth&#39;s rotation. They are winds that traverse through areas of pressure differential in the atmosphere. Moreover, they are quite localized and not what you would expect from a sphere that is rotating at 1,670 km/h at the equator. Jet streams travel at 80 - 140 km/h. Neither do they follow the path of the earth&#39;s rotation. You should do more research too, not simply use buzzwords to explain away everything to fit a particular narrative.</p>

<p>Because you are lacking sincere understanding of physics and especially Gravity.</p>

<p>Space is a vaccum. earth is a body of mass.
Relativity, which has been tested and proven many times: id love for you to try and debunk it. But relativity tells us that large bodies of mass exert gravity. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a better explanation:</p>

<p>The atmosphere rotates along with the Earth for the same reason you do.</p>

<p>Force isn&#39;t needed to make something go.  That&#39;s a basic law of physics - that a thing that&#39;s moving will just keep moving if there&#39;s no force on it.</p>

<p>Force is needed either to make something change its speed, or to make its motion point in a new direction.  A force can do both or just one of these.  Most forces do both, but a force that pushes in the exactly the same direction you&#39;re already going only changes your speed, and does not change your direction.  A force that pushes at a right angle to the direction you&#39;re already going only changes your direction, and does not add any speed.  A force at &quot;10 o&#39;clock&quot;, for example, will change both your speed and your direction.</p>

<p>As you stand still on Earth, you continue going the same speed, but your direction changes; between day and night you move opposite directions.  So the forces on you must be at a right angle to your direction of motion.  Indeed, they are.  Your motion is from west to east along the surface of the Earth, and the force of gravity pulls you down towards the center of the Earth - the force and your motion are at right angles.  Similarly for the atmosphere.  It is moving along with the Earth, and moving at a constant speed.  It does not need anything to push it along with the Earth.  Since only its direction of motion is changing, it only needs a force at a right angle to its motion, the same as you, and the force that does the job is again gravity.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not the whole picture, because the amount that your direction of motion changes depends on how strong the right-angle force is.  It turns out gravity is much too strong for how much our direction of motion changes as the Earth spins.  There must be some other force on us and on the atmosphere canceling out most of the gravity.  There is.  For me it&#39;s the force of the chair on my butt.  For the atmosphere, it&#39;s the air pressure.</p>

<p>So gravity doesn&#39;t &quot;make the air rotate&quot;.  The air is already going, and gravity simply changes its direction to pull it in a circle.  </p>

<p>You may be wondering why the air doesn&#39;t just sit there and have the Earth spin underneath it.  One answer to that is that from our point of view that would mean incredibly strong wind all the time.  That wind would run into stuff and eventually get slowed down to zero (that&#39;s from our point of view - the air would &quot;speed up&quot; to our speed of rotation from a point of view out in space watching everything happen).  Even the air high up would eventually rotate with the Earth because although it can&#39;t slam into mountains or buildings and get stopped from blowing, it can essentially &quot;slam into&quot; the air beneath it due to friction in the air.  (This is a little redundant with dmckee&#39;s answer; I was half way done when he beat me to the punch)</p>

<p>How so? Air is highly viscuous, the boundary layer thickness should be no greater than a few meters, if even that. </p>

There was a little back and forth, and trying to find an explanation, I found out that not just can the surface of the planet not drag the whole atmosphere with it - it is even slower than the atmosphere. </p>

<p>Jet streams, coriolis forces etc. do not explain the net superrotation of at least 2% - 30%. </p>

<p>Disclaimer: it does not prove geocentrism or flat earth or concave earth true, IMO. It only disproves the mainstream idea that friction is responsible for the co-rotation of the atmosphere, and a whole lot more is going on than what is taught as &quot;scientific expert consensus&quot;.</p>

<p>This is what is called &quot;Peplosphäre&quot; in German: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_boundary_layer">The Planetary Boundary Layer</a>. It states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For engineering purposes, the wind gradient is modeled as a simple shear exhibiting a vertical velocity profile varying according to a power law with a constant exponential coefficient based on surface type. The height above ground where surface friction has a negligible effect on wind speed is called the &quot;gradient height&quot; and the wind speed above this height is assumed to be a constant called the &quot;gradient wind speed&quot;. For example, typical values for the predicted gradient height are 457 m for large cities, 366 m for suburbs, 274 m for open terrain, and 213 m for open sea.</p>

<p>Although the power law exponent approximation is convenient, it has no theoretical basis. When the temperature profile is adiabatic, the wind speed should vary logarithmically with height, Measurements over open terrain in 1961 showed good agreement with the logarithmic fit up to 100 m or so (within the surface layer), with near constant average wind speed up through 1000 m.</p>

<p>If you have a degree in aero engineering please tell me the instruments used in calculating the spin of the earth for north south landing strips so it can land perfectly without the supposed spin throwing the airplane off.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gravity affects every object on the earth. Just because you are in a plane over the ground doesn&#39;t mean that gravity stops working for you. From the perspective of the plane, the earth is not spinning.  There is thus no need to account for the difference in spin.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also how does a plane with a top speed of 600mph fly in the direction of the 1000mph spinning earth and get anywhere?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Same as above. The plane (and everything else on the planet) is subject to the same force of gravity. If you are on a train travelling 60 mph, how is it that you can walk from the back of the train to the front if your top walking speed is 3 mph?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How does the horizon raise to the same exact point when I am on the ground as to when I am 7-8 miles up no matter how big the ball this line would drop yet it does not it rises with your eyeline to the same exact spot.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The horizon is not a physical object. It doesn&#39;t technically exist. It is a perceived construct. It will always appear to be the same height from your perspective, because (drum roll!) the earth is spherical. What will change with height is your perception of the curvature of the earth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you weigh 200 lbs on the equator spinning at 1000mph how much would you weigh at the north pole (1 mph rotation if that) without all that centrifugal force throwing you off and lightening your weight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is actually measurable - it&#39;s called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E%C3%B6tv%C3%B6s_effect">Eötvös effect</a>. It just so happens that the difference in weight caused by centripetal force is far too small to be perceived.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How do constellations not change for millenia?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How do you know that they have not changed &quot;for millenia&quot;? We have only been making accurate measurements for the last two or three centuries. All stellar objects are rotating around the galactic center with the same velocities with respect to each other. The galactic period is about 225 to 250 million years. Mankind is about 100,000 years old. In that time, the solar system has traveled about 0.04% of it&#39;s circuit around the galaxy. How would we be able to perceive a change of 0.04% over 100,000 years?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How come sundials from 750 years ago work perfectly down to the minute today? This would discount the supposed 23.5 wobble.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why would it be different over 750 years? Axial tilt affects the location of the shadow on a sundial over the course of a year. By the next year, the sundial will be back to its original position. We would not notice any change for millions of years.</p>

I&#39;d hate to think how much that camera cost to get to orbit, along with the systems that allow it to stream to earth, though I imagine it just piggybacks more basic systems. They don&#39;t show the sun because it&#39;d blind the camera completely, which is shown in alot of videos of launched. Mainly shuttles or the Fairing video from SpaceX. They don&#39;t show the moon because 
A) It&#39;s very far away, so there&#39;s relatively little to see, and 
B) They would need to gimbal the camera due to the speed at which the ISS is orbiting. Whereas just pointing it at the ground means it only ever has to face one direction to face the earth and show people what they&#39;re on the site to see.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>They say that the atmosphere is also suspended in rotation around the earth just like the whole &quot;earth&quot; in its entirety. Apparently gravity keeps it this way. See gravity is not just the force acting downwards on an object, but also the collective force applied to every successive layer above it. This keeps things with relative velocity to each other be exactly 0. I have problems with that but when talking it over with my brother, my brother said he compares the earth rotating as a spinning top, the atmosphere is also locked into this spin. I am leaning more towards the other version where there should be winds and planes should take shorter time flying one way than the other. Anyway, putting this aside for now.</p></li>
<li><p>Same as point 1. (Relative speed of 1000 is 0 since even at 0 km/hr the earth is spinning. Weird I know, but that&#39;s how they explain satellites.</p></li>
<li><p>The earth is so big that even if it were round, it would be practically flat for us, unless if we were really really high up.</p></li>
<li><p>Good one, I will think about that.</p></li>
<li><p>Constellations change however they do very slowly for our recorded history to have noticed.</p></li>

<p>Hey bud, I&#39;m still on the fence, but getting really irritated by the round earth model that says we are spinning incredibly fast and being flung at an amazing speed into space. If that was the case, our atmosphere would have been shaped like that of a comet, yet that isn&#39;t the case.</p>

<p>As a footnote, It is hard to change your world view so quickly, sometimes. Sometimes, you have to give it time to sink in. The propaganda machine is really strong.</p>

<p>Centripetal acceleration is given by v<sup>2</sup> /r, where v is the tangential velocity and r is the radius. Tangential velocity works out to be about 1000mph, or about 450 m/s. Using a radius of 6400km, you get an acceleration of about .032 m/s<sup>2</sup> . Given that g is roughly 10 m/s<sup>2</sup> , you would weigh .32% less at the equator.

<p>If you have a degree in aero engineering please tell me the instruments used in calculating the spin of the earth for north south landing strips so it can land perfectly without the supposed spin throwing the airplane off.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gravity affects every object on the earth. Just because you are in a plane over the ground doesn&#39;t mean that gravity stops working for you. From the perspective of the plane, the earth is not spinning.  There is thus no need to account for the difference in spin.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also how does a plane with a top speed of 600mph fly in the direction of the 1000mph spinning earth and get anywhere?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Same as above. The plane (and everything else on the planet) is subject to the same force of gravity. If you are on a train travelling 60 mph, how is it that you can walk from the back of the train to the front if your top walking speed is 3 mph?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How does the horizon raise to the same exact point when I am on the ground as to when I am 7-8 miles up no matter how big the ball this line would drop yet it does not it rises with your eyeline to the same exact spot.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The horizon is not a physical object. It doesn&#39;t technically exist. It is a perceived construct. It will always appear to be the same height from your perspective, because (drum roll!) the earth is spherical. What will change with height is your perception of the curvature of the earth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you weigh 200 lbs on the equator spinning at 1000mph how much would you weigh at the north pole (1 mph rotation if that) without all that centrifugal force throwing you off and lightening your weight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is actually measurable - it&#39;s called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E%C3%B6tv%C3%B6s_effect">Eötvös effect</a>. It just so happens that the difference in weight caused by centripetal force is far too small to be perceived.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How do constellations not change for millenia?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How do you know that they have not changed &quot;for millenia&quot;? We have only been making accurate measurements for the last two or three centuries. All stellar objects are rotating around the galactic center with the same velocities with respect to each other. The galactic period is about 225 to 250 million years. Mankind is about 100,000 years old. In that time, the solar system has traveled about 0.04% of it&#39;s circuit around the galaxy. How would we be able to perceive a change of 0.04% over 100,000 years?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How come sundials from 750 years ago work perfectly down to the minute today? This would discount the supposed 23.5 wobble.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why would it be different over 750 years? Axial tilt affects the location of the shadow on a sundial over the course of a year. By the next year, the sundial will be back to its original position. We would not notice any change for millions of years.</p>
