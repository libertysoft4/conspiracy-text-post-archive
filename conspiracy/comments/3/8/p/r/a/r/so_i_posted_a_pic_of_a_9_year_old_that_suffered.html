        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/38ph80/a_9_year_old_girl_suffering_from_the_effects_of_a/">http://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/38ph80/a_9_year_old_girl_suffering_from_the_effects_of_a/</a></p>

<p>UPDATE: TO clarify what happened here, I am not good with english and was bombarded by all these shills. I was not able to answer quickly and concise as i wanted, a tactic they use to disorient you.</p>

<p>I posted a pic in r/pics from <a href="https://instagram.com/p/3jcd8VoVdD/?taken-by=natgeo">Natgeo&#39;s own Instagram on the effects of Agent Orange</a> in todays time frame. Immediately Three users and a mod of <a href="/r/GMOMyths">/r/GMOMyths</a> instantly started commenting and down voting all my comments. They hijacked the response comment from which the mod or r/pics asked me as to why it was flagged. The users used cut and past response initially. The three users bullied me. As soon made a post here within seconds these users listed below posted identical &quot;brigading&quot; comments to this post as the original one on r/pics. How does someone with an already -29% down vote draw the attention of so many <a href="/r/GMOMyths">/r/GMOMyths</a>?   </p>

<p>How do these three just randomly show up to a down voted beyond oblivion post? most likely they are either the same poster or the info was passed to friends within the same sub. Basically they brigading me. The only account initially responding here are in r/conspiracy also fit the &quot;within seconds&quot; of posting saying i am performing a brigade and that I am dishonest and that I am dumb, whatever have same identical in negativity and anti conspiracy thinking, as in Pro GMO and Pro vaccine. One has even admitted that his account here is for being the opposing <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> viewpoint, too convent i say.   </p>

<p>Now where does this all come together? I am not America, I am Thai. I also don&#39;t understand english that well and i didn&#39;t know about brigading but i felt attacked by the same three people that were from the same sub so i went on defense, this is wrong. </p>

<p>Ironically at the same time users in this sub also were attacking me and if you review their post history you will see they attack everyone here. So i kicked a bee&#39;s nest and they followed me here. I did the wrong thing by asking others to go to my r/pics/ but within a small amount of MINUTES that i found to what i did is wrong i corrected it, yet these sam individual would not stop talking about what i did but kept on preforming the brigade on me here. Pot call kettle black.  </p>

<p>Now the argument they keep asking is how do we know monsanto produced this agent orange? kind of dumb question because 1 they admit it on their company webpage. 2 they did admit so there is a one in nine chance that this girl was a victim of Monsanto&#39;s chemical. 3. if there are nine companies and they admit it they are guilty of making this by association alone. Honestly I was moved by what i saw on NatGoe&#39;s Instagram... shills please go to their Instagram and try to convince the hundreds that agree with me.</p>

<p>I am abandoning this account 90b but i will not delete this as they asked me too, its up to you to keep it r not.</p>

<p>Sawatdee khrap.</p>

<p>Just exposing new Shills. No need to jump in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh look! just like that, the coward who called for a brigade after some people disagreed with him has found an excuse to discount the opinions of people in here too! </p>

<p>Yep, I disagree with you on a couple topics! I guess for those too immature to cope with the reality that they exist in a world of people with varying opinions this means that I must be an employee of some government or corporations sent to stop you!</p>

<p>Do you not realize how comically delusional you are being?</p>

<p>For the record, yes if you don&#39;t mark an edit that erases the evidence that people are calling you out for and then fail to mark said edit, you are in essence lying to save face. Add a little edit detailing how you ran here for help after someone&#39;s opinion scared you.</p>

<p>I cannot find one post that goes with the narrative of a r/conspracy.</p>

<p>Well, that is because this is the account I use when I comment against the r/conspiracy status quo. It&#39;s an alt because people here are obsessed with digging into user&#39;s comment history rather than addressing their posts (source: you).</p>

<blockquote>

<p>What names did I call you before you started calling me a shill? I generally try not to insult people until they deem themselves incapable of regular conversation, so if I insulted you based on the stupid shit you were posting to other people, I apologize.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said it was creepy. I said it was sad.</p>

<p>It is sad because you had no where to stand in your arguments so you resorted to digging through my comments for excuses to call me a shill. Real, honest adults address the topic at hand instead of hiding behind silly little accusations and coming up with excuses not to engage in conversation. </p>

<p>But it is clear you aren&#39;t an honest adult, as you don&#39;t seem to understand this concept in the slightest. That is why it is sad. </p>

<p>You really think you &quot;exposed&quot; something eh? That is so awesome. Yep, you&#39;ve got me, I am totally a shill. We saw how dangerous you were to the secret Monsanto agenda 9b0 so we decided to send in a shill squad to downvote and silence your genius words! You were mocked in this thread not because you failed to provide any evidence for your claims and embarassed yourself repeatedly, but because Big Agro knows how smart and totally not dumb you are.</p>

<p>You say this in a post where you literally asked people to gang up on some redittors with you. Do you not remember that?</p>

<p>A couple days ago I was responding to make sure everyone in the thread could see how dishonest and unsubstantiated your claims. No I&#39;m responding in hopes that you will keep going. I find it funny.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>But you didn&#39;t indicate the change in your post, so you tried to make me look like a liar for calling you on your shit. And you immediately called me a shill for calling you out, like a child.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Not nice to people who accuse me of working for some shady organization to surpress truth. If you want me to be nice, learn to act like an adult. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You posted that and worded it not really in a nice way, kind of harsh tense. English is not my first language, ok. At the same time I have two post going and both post are getting lots of replies but all from users that post to the same GMOMyths sub. You replied to mine within seconds and at the same time on my post in /pics someone posted en equally identical post except they are from GMOmyths. coincidence? Here is the deal I have gotten PM&#39;s from others that in the past 3 days have been bombarded by this sub, moving into discussions and downvoting all and commenting against all, you probably don&#39;t wont to be involved in it as 3 of the 5 PM&#39;s I got are reporting them all (same users). I guess some things are bigger then you. In all honesty I don&#39;t really care about GMO or even Monsanto... its not even conspiracy thing, I posted a pic I saw on instagram and googled the company that made Agent Orange... like I didn&#39;t go looking to attack Monsanto to a pic posted in /Pic.. I mean come on.</p>

<p>Not an excuse for lying and accusing me of things with zero evidence. If you want me to be nice, do the adult thing and apologize. I held you accountable for your claims (and you refused to present any evidence)</p>

<p>I was browsing the new section, your post was ~10 minutes old when I found it. So, half coincidence, and half you misremembering the timeline.</p>

<p>Yes they had me tied up, and of course I am not quick on the type. I also am far from dumb my friend I worked YEARS at UN World Bank under the Thai development in R&amp;D. IM not some typical nut job. I also live a half a mile away from Monsanto HQ in DC. ON that note now maybe you can see where I come from and understand that I was rapped up answering bulling questions at the time and I did then mistake your comments as threating and part of their brigade, I officially apologize to you. Please have  good day and I will remove your name from top text and anywhere you seem fit :-)</p>
