        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am an <a href="http://theneworder.org/">American National Socialist</a></p>

<p>We don&#39;t believe in harming anyone based on ethnicity, but we are not pacifists and consider &quot;diversity&quot; a deliberate attempt to end White Western Civilization and instead place only Jewish Finance at the top as a world government. To that extent, we see it as a defensive move to safeguard a living space for our race since <a href="http://www.topix.com/forum/atlanta/T06P0LRFND11LDDRB">Whites are less than 8% of the global population now</a></p>

<p>We know beyond any doubt that the Holocaust® is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dda-0Q_XUhk">atrocity propaganda</a>  that has it&#39;s origins in Soviet (Jewish) propaganda think tanks filled with men like <a href="http://rense.com/general75/ehr.htm">Ilya Ehrenberg</a></p>

<p>The purpose of creating false atrocities to attribute to the Axis powers was first and foremost to prevent the populations of the Allied nations from questioning the &quot;justness&quot; of the Second World War, and to try and prevent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_collaborationism_with_the_Axis_powers">Mass Russian Defection to Germany to overthrow Communism</a></p>

<p>They&#39;ve had since 1945 to show us what they would do with their grand vision of the world, and it&#39;s steadily becoming more and more third world while &quot;they&quot; live behind gated communities far away from the &quot;diversity&quot; they push for. </p>

<p>Anyone or any nation that rises to challenge these Jews who are rootless is painted as basically a comic book villain. (Islamofascism etc. for simply fighting to be free of foreign jewish occupation). So hopefully you can consider that &quot;Hey, if they lied about Saddam, Assad, Gaddafi, Ahmadinejad, etc. Why would they all the sudden be 100% truthful about Hitler&#39;s ambitions?&quot; </p>

<p>I&#39;m more than happy to answer any questions, I&#39;ll probably ignore posts that are just what I call &quot;disagreeing for the sake of disagreeing&quot; i.e. &quot;You gotta be a reeetard to deny the six million!&quot; </p>

<p>Other cultures actually venerate their ancestors...you know at like very great time and money expense to themselves.  They honestly believe that the past/present are dependent/resultant on the favor of those that came before them.  </p>

<p>White western people are the ones that developed a culture that placed money before family, alive or dead.  So you&#39;re suggestion he become a rugged self made individualist...its just really in line with his worldview.  Its really great advice!</p>

<p>While you&#39;re at it why don&#39;t you source that or provide any evidence for that claim. Of course besides the uninformed assumptions. </p>

<p>&quot;communist states dont have dictators&quot;</p>

<p>Um every successful communist revolution has resulted in the same Jewish bolshevik tyranny. Youre the odd man out son. </p>

<p>Communism is a Jewish fraud invented led and financed by Jews its a counter revolution of useful idiots. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It isn&#39;t my view.  It is Marx&#39;s.  I now know for sure you have never studied communism because you don&#39;t even know the basics.
The ignorant always laugh at what they don&#39;t understand.
A communist society is a classless society with group ownership of the means of production and government.<br/>
A dictatorship is never communist, they just use the word.
Kind of like how national socialists are not socialists at all.
You don&#39;t even understand basic political theory.  You didn&#39;t even know the political spectrum is a circle not a straight line.  How the far right and far left have more in common than moderates.
Good luck out there.
I suggest you study the political ideologies that you claimed to, so you can give a better argument.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is clearly a delusion you have been suffering from for some time.</p>

<p>I have said it many times. Every successful red revolution has resulted in the same judeo  bolshevik tyranny. You are the one who has Communism confused if you think &quot;If only X was in charge instead&quot; would mean anything different. </p>

<p>The fundamentals of Communism are false.</p>

<p>Equality</p>

<p>Eliminating family unit</p>

<p>The idea we can import cannibals and witch doctors and with school they will be great engineers or architects. </p>

<p>&quot;You don&#39;t even know the political spectrum is a circle and not a straight line&quot;</p>

<p>This proves anything I&#39;ve stated wrong how? This shows how Communism will uplift anyone&#39;s life how? </p>

<p>Why do you say such ridiculous things and somehow think that it&#39;s some great refutation. </p>

<p>&quot;How the far right and far left have more in common than moderates&quot;</p>

<p>More slogans, more just disagreeing for the sake of disagreeing. </p>

<p>Your entire philosophy revolves around emotional appeals, and regurgitated slogans. You can&#39;t deal with any of the facts at hand because you have none. </p>

<p>You read the entire OP and in your mouth breather short sightedness say &quot;Have you even studied communism? Nothing is Communism except....&quot;   nothing. </p>

<p>Like I said before, this isn&#39;t a thread about your version of Communism, this is about National Socialism. /anarchism is the other way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What of international plutocratic criminal conspiracy done by folks of other ethnic/spiritual persuasions?  You propose the dominance of one group over key social sectors, yet dominance does not equal entirety of control.  Even if I acknowledge what you&#39;re proposing is possible, I think levying singular blame (along with resultant spite) is shortsighted and dangerous.</p>

<p>Surely, just as an exercise in perspective, it might be good to discuss other groups who have been successful at major international criminal conspiracy?  Obviously Zionism has had great collaborators from non-&quot;Jewish dominated&quot; societies...the British come to mind.  How about the non-Jewish American politicians that paved the way for a greater Israel for their own domestic ends?  Am I really to assume that because (what you characterize as) one group has been successful at the global chess game all collaborators are wholly owned and coopted?  Surely the Nationalist Socialist platform has room for discussion around other bogeymen?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you think voices critical of Zionism are beholden to above average amounts of censorship from positions of power I think you&#39;re right.  I agree with the sentiment, and it fits into my lived experience.  </p>

<p>However, again, I think it&#39;s a perceptual misstep insinuate that there&#39;s something inherently Jewish about that setup.  The structures and institutions you mention could be of any national, ethnic, or religious makeup and would still attempt to execute social control through use of censorship and shaming.  They&#39;re gate keeping power...  You could just as easily be railing against any western institutional culture, systematic oppression agents, or  dominant right to rule mindsets across ruling elite cultures.  Instead you&#39;re attempting to make human corruption and incompetence somehow inherently Jewish? Or is it just that the Jewish brand of corruption and incompetence is like...more worser than other similar brands?  </p>

<p>I understand that if there were were no pushback to publicly critically discussing the problems of Zionism or the Holocaust these things wouldn&#39;t be discussed by your circles at the volume and frequency they are.  Maybe we could identify other areas where social control lockdowns are similarly stringent, and discuss if it makes tactical sense for your party to expend similar amounts of energy towards exposing and countering those elements.. </p>

<p>It almost reads like a correlation/causation error.</p>

<p>From where I&#39;m sitting the platform looks reverse engineered or something. Like the strategy is debase an entire people, and the tactics used in doing so are justified using methods that could be applied to any number of similar groups.  While you say similar attention is paid to these similar groups internally...that dynamic is not obvious to an interested outsider.</p>
