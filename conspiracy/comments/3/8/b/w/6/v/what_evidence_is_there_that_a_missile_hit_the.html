<li>At least 85 videos in government possession that were confiscated have not be released despite multiple FOIA requests. Only an edited video showing a few frames of an indistinguishable object hitting the pentagon is shown to the public. If the government were telling the truth, why not release as many videos as you can to put all the naysayers to rest and make your position/case stronger? And don&#39;t say political or burecratic reasons, everyone remotely tied to the official story wants to make the &quot;terrists did it&quot; story as solid as possible. </li>

<li>The cab driver in the famous photo showing knocked down light poles (which by the way, don&#39;t coincide with flight path models the jet would have had to have taken, and are most likely staged) has a significantly different story when he doesn&#39;t realize he&#39;s being recorded.

<li>A decent list here (connecting the dots):</li>
</ol>

<p>Analysis of the physical damage to the Pentagon and lack of debris. You can’t fit a 125 foot wide Boeing 757 into a hole 16 feet wide.  The theory that the plane vaporized is idiotic.  And, what happened to the wings that allegedly sheared off?<br/>
DOT
The official story of how the plane arrived at the Pentagon by making a 270 degree turn at a speed of 800 kilometers per hour is absurd.  A Boeing 757 could not possibly perform that maneuver according to experts.<br/>
DOT
AA Flight 77 was lost from radar as early as 8:56 a.m. and then allegedly reappeared 36 minutes later at 9:32 am. According to Danielle O’Brien, an air traffic controller at Dulles International Airport, the plane that showed up on the radar was not Flight 77: “The speed, the maneuverability, the way that it turned, we all thought in the radar room, all of us experienced air traffic controllers, that it was a military plane.”<br/>
DOT
No unknown aircraft are allowed within 50 miles of the Pentagon.  The Pentagon has its own anti-aircraft missiles that should have fired to protect the building. Only a military aircraft with a special IFF transponder (identifying it as a friend) would have been allowed to approach the Pentagon.<br/>
DOT
CNN reporter on the scene shortly after the impact saying that there was no evidence of a plane hitting the Pentagon.<br/>
DOT
Aerial footage showing no debris (confirming the report by the CNN reporter), plus more analysis showing the size of a Boeing 757 compared to the size of the hole in the Pentagon.  Recall also that the initial hole was only 16 feet wide and the CNN reporter said that the Pentagon structure did not collapse until about 45 minutes after impact.   DOT
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and 9/11 Commission Member Timothy Roemer both saying that a MISSILE was used on the Pentagon.<br/>
DOT
Analysis of the Pentagon video footage of the alleged Boeing 757 (it certainly doesn’t look like a Boeing 757) hitting the Pentagon that concludes it was faked.<br/>
DOT
A leaked video showing a missile hitting the Pentagon.<br/>
DOT
Expert testimony that a high radiation reading near Pentagon indicated that a “depleted uranium warhead may have been used”<br/>
DOT
Two witnesses who were at the Pentagon who said there was no debris or jet fuel, and another witness who “was convinced it was a missile. It came in so fast it sounded nothing like an airplane.” 
DOT
KEY POINT. Many people reported seeing a low-flying plane heading towards the Pentagon.  Thanks to a series of videotaped interviews with multiple witnesses by the Citizens Investigation Team, we find out that: (a) a plane did approach the Pentagon, but it was smaller than a Boeing 757, and it approached from a different angle than reported by the 9/11 commission; (b) the plane did not actually hit the Pentagon, but instead flew past the Pentagon at under 200 feet – immediately after the missile hit; (c) the downed flag poles at the Pentagon were staged, which was admitted by the taxi driver whose taxi was supposedly hit by one of the falling poles.

<p>Those are the most damning pieces. You might be able to explain away a few of these, but some such as the cab driver and the vaporization of the plane can&#39;t be written off.</p>

<p>You mean, like the one on a commercial airliner?

<p>Actually, the <em>vast majority</em> of independent witnesses clearly state it was a plane. Very few specify a missile [note: not saying it flew &quot;like a missile&quot;, saying it WAS a missile]. If you&#39;re going to claim a missile, you need to explain this.</p>

<p>I think your average eyewitness knows what a plane looks like, and it&#39;s very silly to suggest otherwise.</p>

<p>To go over your &quot;key items&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Intentional stand down order from Cheney.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cheney wasn&#39;t in charge of NORAD on 9/11, and so had no authority to give any such order. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Impossible to nearly impossible flight maneuvers for amateur pilots.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Opinion, not fact. And <a href="http://www.askthepilot.com/questionanswers/conspiracy-nation/">not everyone agrees</a>: &quot;Hani Hanjour’s flying was exceptional only in its recklessness.  If anything, his loops and spirals above the nation’s capital revealed him to be exactly the shitty pilot he by all accounts was.&quot; That&#39;s from a pilot who flies 757 and 767 for a living. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cab driver basically admits the government story is false, and he was playing a role intentionally.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[Sigh] A cab driver tells a story. S&#39;funny. Eye-witnesses are totally ignored when what they report doesn&#39;t tie in with your theory, but find one who might support it, and suddenly, it&#39;s a &quot;key&quot; fact.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Intentional confiscation and subsequent refusal to release crucial data that would substantiate or refute the government story(video).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not evidence, in any shape or size for a missile. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Totally inconsistent impact, wings/bodies completely disappear. Compare that to every large plane crash in history.</p>

<p>Find me other plane crashes where a plane was deliberately flown, as fast as possible, into one of the biggest buildings by floor space in the world. Then we&#39;ll see whether this is consistent or not. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if MOST is the word you are looking for considering the majority of testimony on the site you linked to was people hearing the explosion, not seeing anything. Independent documentaries that have interviewed people show conflicting reports on the subject. </p>

<p>Many of your eyewitnesses that see a plane fly over them are actually seeing a second plane, not the (object) that hit the pentagon. </p>

<p>No one is talking about Norad. He gave a stand down order from the white house bunker. </p>

<p>[Sigh] A cab driver tells a story. S&#39;funny. Eye-witnesses are totally ignored when what they report doesn&#39;t tie in with your theory, but find one who might support it, and suddenly, it&#39;s a &quot;key&quot; fact.</p>

<p>The guy admitted to a setup. He&#39;s not just an eyewitness, if anything he&#39;s the most important eyewitness because he was a crucial part of the whole charade. Did you even watch the video?</p>

<p>Opinion, not fact. And not everyone agrees: &quot;Hani Hanjour’s flying was exceptional only in its recklessness.

</blockquote>

<p>One pilot. Compared to pilots for 9/11 truth who basically prove that his flight path was impossible. Combine that with the cab drivers testimony stating it was a conspiracy...</p>

<p>Not evidence, in any shape or size for a missile.</p>

<p>No, they confiscated all this video, but refuse to release it. If it was a plane why not release it? You valiant defenders of the government story can NEVER explain this properly. &quot;national security reasons&quot;. Lol.</p>

<p>I never claimed a missile hit the pentagon. How about you prove a plane hit the pentagon? All we have is conflicting eyewitness reports, no footage, and damage that is inconsistent with a plane crash.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Find me other plane crashes where a plane was deliberately flown, as fast as possible, into one of the biggest buildings by floor space in the world. Then we&#39;ll see whether this is consistent or not.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Intent and location and target do NOT matter when it comes to debris that should be left behind. All that matters is mass and velocity. Plenty of planes have crashed over the decades as large or larger than the one that was supposedly flown into the pentagon on 9/11. Not a single one left behind so little debris, and not one body. </p>

<p>Every plane crash in history (other than those that hit the ocean) leaves behind bodies, except for the pentagon, it must have some special shield or something that vaporizes organic matter on contact.</p>

<p>Seriously, intent, and target literally mean nothing when it comes to what should be left behind. The only thing that matter is size of the aircraft, and speed, both of which are completely comparable to any other aircraft in history.</p>

<p>The damage on the pentagon is totally inconsistent with what a plane should do as well, not to mention the missing parts. </p>

<p>&quot;Intent and target mean nothing&quot;? Really? So if you deliberately plow a car head-on into an overpass, the resulting damage will be the same as if you accidentally sideswipe a crash barrier?</p>

<p>How can you even take yourself seriously with these strawman arguments? You know exactly what I mean, organic matter doesn&#39;t just disappear because a plane hits a building instead of a field or an ocean. </p>

<p>Not to mention, it&#39;s pointless arguing alone these lines anyways because the flight maneuvers supposedly taken by the pilots were quite impossible and the cab driver admits to a setup. </p>

<p>Except, that <a href="http://ww2.dcmilitary.com/dcmilitary_archives/stories/112901/12279-1.shtml">certainly didn&#39;t happen</a> as you alleged: all but five victims were identified from the remains. Any more factually incorrect claims you&#39;d like to make?</p>

<p>Your other two arguments are respectively 1) unproven, since I&#39;ve already shown you a pilot saying they were perfectly possible, and 2) pure speculation, which <strong>at the very worst</strong>, shows a witness exaggerating his own role (and that would certainly be in line with England&#39;s subsequent delusional statements).

<p>Having DNA remains at the site, and having bodies are two completely different things. Not a single body near the lawn (not talking about bodies in the pentagon) indicates that it was likely not a plane that hit the pentagon. Most people&#39;s DNA is not on record, so identifying victims through DNA when you have no prior match is ridiculous. It&#39;s not as if family members sent in hair or skin samples to be matched. Basically the government is saying &quot;take our word for it&quot;. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not speculation, he admits to a setup when he thinks he&#39;s off camera. You&#39;re kinda grasping at straws to explain that one away.</p>

<p>Still no explanation for the government refusing to release over 75+ recordings nearby the pentagon that day.</p>

<p>Whoops. You&#39;re backtracking so fast from your previous claim &quot;organic matter doesn&#39;t just disappear&quot; you&#39;re becoming a <strong>blur</strong>.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t know much about Newton&#39;s Laws of Motion, do you? So when you&#39;re flung at hundreds of miles an hour into a building, you&#39;re going to bounce backwards? </p>

<p>Two-thirds of the victims were military personnel, who will certainly have previously had blood samples drawn and analyzed. Asking family members of those on the passenger manifest to provide samples would be perfectly normal. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Basically the government is saying &quot;take our word for it&quot;. </p>

<p>The government...and all the families of every single one of the victims, and everyone who knows them. Thousands upon thousands of people! They all must be in on it too!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can find one scientist that claims the earth is flat, that doesn&#39;t magically dissipate a claim. </p>

<p>So on this basis, you also write off the small minority of engineers who think WTC 7 was a demolitions job as well. Glad we got that put to rest. But yet another claim, that the maneuvers &quot;were quite impossible&quot;, is destroyed. Some pilots say that. Others disagree. </p>

<p>So, now all you&#39;ve got left as &quot;evidence&quot; is one loony cab-driver. Good effort!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, let&#39;s just vere of into an entirely different conversation. OK there&#39;s a video of the test for that scenario and it shows the foam going through a plane hull. Even the scientists couldn&#39;t believe it, but it was all based on basic science calculations the engineers did when the observed the foam impact. Still besides the point, 120 wing span doesn&#39;t fold into a fifteen foot hole, its never happened.Just like three buildings collapsing on there own imprint without explosives, it&#39;s never happened.</p>

<p>That&#39;s great. That&#39;s also not the same thing as the actual incident. It hit the wing, dented/damaged/scraped/what have you it, this in turn screwed up the thermal protection which is why it went up in flames upon re-enry.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>See, I don&#39;t get this argument. Just because it&#39;s never happened before means it can&#39;t be possible? </p>

<p>You do understand that the AE for 9/11 group is made up of less than half a percentage of all certified architects and engineers in the nation right? Arguably that means that the majority of experts reject alternate 9/11 theories.</p>

<p>Yes, your grammar is stellar. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>By comparing the member count of AE911 with the amount of practicing architects and engineers in the US.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where&#39;s the group if architects who believe the NIST report , they don&#39;t have a group</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Probably because they don&#39;t need a group. They don&#39;t have to throw around what they believe because most people already believe it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>AE911 held an open debate on the physics of 911, not one person from the other side showed up, where are your supporters?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Moved on most likely. (I&#39;d also argue that people don&#39;t take AE911 too seriously anyways and just kind of disregarded it.) 9/11 was almost 14 years ago. The lines in the sand are drawn, you either believe the official story or you don&#39;t. Most people on the official story line just don&#39;t bother anymore. It&#39;s why you don&#39;t see heated debates on JFK or the Illuminati or anything. It&#39;s been around for ages and the only people you see arguing about it are those that adhere to alternate theories and bored people on forums.</p>

<p>Actually, the vast majority of independent witnesses clearly state it was a plane. Very few specify a missile [note: not saying it flew &quot;like a missile&quot;, saying it WAS a missile]. If you&#39;re going to claim a missile, you need to explain this.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if MOST is the word you are looking for considering the majority of testimony on the site you linked to was people hearing the explosion, not seeing anything. Independent documentaries that have interviewed people show conflicting reports on the subject. </p>

<p>Many of your eyewitnesses that see a plane fly over them are actually seeing a second plane, not the (object) that hit the pentagon. </p>

<p>The guy admitted to a setup. He&#39;s not just an eyewitness, if anything he&#39;s the most important eyewitness because he was a crucial part of the whole charade. Did you even watch the video?</p>

<p>One pilot. Compared to pilots for 9/11 truth who basically prove that his flight path was impossible. Combine that with the cab drivers testimony stating it was a conspiracy...</p>

<p>No, they confiscated all this video, but refuse to release it. If it was a plane why not release it? You valiant defenders of the government story can NEVER explain this properly. &quot;national security reasons&quot;. Lol.</p>

<p>I never claimed a missile hit the pentagon. How about you prove a plane hit the pentagon? All we have is conflicting eyewitness reports, no footage, and damage that is inconsistent with a plane crash.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Find me other plane crashes where a plane was deliberately flown, as fast as possible, into one of the biggest buildings by floor space in the world. Then we&#39;ll see whether this is consistent or not.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Intent and location and target do NOT matter when it comes to debris that should be left behind. All that matters is mass and velocity. Plenty of planes have crashed over the decades as large or larger than the one that was supposedly flown into the pentagon on 9/11. Not a single one left behind so little debris, and not one body. </p>

<p>Every plane crash in history (other than those that hit the ocean) leaves behind bodies, except for the pentagon, it must have some special shield or something that vaporizes organic matter on contact.</p>

<p>Seriously, intent, and target literally mean nothing when it comes to what should be left behind. The only thing that matter is size of the aircraft, and speed, both of which are completely comparable to any other aircraft in history.</p>

<p>The damage on the pentagon is totally inconsistent with what a plane should do as well, not to mention the missing parts. </p>

<p>Your other two arguments are respectively 1) unproven, since I&#39;ve already shown you a pilot saying they were perfectly possible, and 2) pure speculation, which <strong>at the very worst</strong>, shows a witness exaggerating his own role (and that would certainly be in line with England&#39;s subsequent delusional statements).
