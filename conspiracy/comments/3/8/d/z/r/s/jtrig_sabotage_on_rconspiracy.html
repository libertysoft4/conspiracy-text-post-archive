    <div class="md"><p>Keep going metabolix, this is THE conspiracy. The current &quot;political situation&quot; that  is the psyop. Turn off your TV tune into nature by going outside and experiencing nature. Get yourself a pair of binoculars or a telescope and test out flat earth on bodies of water. Watch the sun moon and stars intently.</p>

<p>Planetariums never have to adjust their stars. Constellations have not changed for millenia. If you were to believe and actually do the actual mental work of just one year of spinning around at 1000 mph at a 67,000 mph spin around a 93 million mile away sun that is stated to be moving around a galactic center at 670,000 MPH you would quickly understand that if all these objects were moving at these speeds not on constellation would repeat year after year as we see perfectly.</p>

<p>Also telescopes have databases of 40,000 objects that remain the same today as they did 20 years ago when they first came out. </p>

<p>If the government would lie about and propagate this myth which has taken in billions if not trillions of our money which would be due back to us and unenslave us as a society, this is my purpose and reason, to unenslave even those who will beg and cry to remain chained to a sick society based of lies and parasitic behavior.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It changes the fact that the government has lied to you and you now have proof in your pocket to fight it. It changes your perspective completely when you really get it. You are no longer some tiny ant crawling on a tiny dust speck in an infinite mess of stars and planets. You are the reason this place exists. The sun moon and stars rotate around YOU! Since day one you have been told you are a piece of shit nobody, a nothing to adhere to rules like a good robot. No you are the reason for this place. This is incredibly empowering when you really grasp it.</p>

<p>It will also let you know very quickly who you are dealing with when it comes to truth. If they talk satellites, galaxies, globe etc. you know they are either ignorant or putting forth the NWO agenda willingly or not.</p>

<p>I remember feeling that way thinking of the implications. I don&#39;t know if most of the government themselves know. Maybe none of them know, remember the monkey and banana experiment?.

    <div class="md"><p>Lol sure bro. That&#39;s the normal reaction to something like this. No what&#39;s not insane is we are spinning around at 1000 mph and whirling around a star at 67,000 mph and that star is spinning around the galaxy at 670,000 mph and somehow this has no affect on the same exact precisely measured positions of the stars that are preprogrammed into telescopes and planetarium for hundreds of years with none of the constellations ever drifting apart the same ones for the 40 years I have been on this plane.</p>

<p>Also, your theory is based on a false premise: we do notice a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_parallax">parallax effect</a> on the stars, tiny as it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude at these supposed speeds and distances yes it would change you aren&#39;t thinking about the issue at all in one galactic rotation our viewpoints and stars would not and could not be the same yearly pattern we have seen for thousands of years. Think about it in 12000 years we would be on the other side of the galaxy. No way we would have been able to keep the same catalog of stars. Our perspective would change so dramatically we would need Peta bytes of storage to catalog them all. But no same ones for thousands of years year after year with eclipses perfectly measured by the ancients and that same model still works today perfectly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really just had questions... but atleast I know what crowd is dving me asking a question. The same ones that want to keep the topic on how evil one certain creed is, and anything else is a psyop because we&#39;re so important here on the reddit, changing minds and opening eyes daily... And since you&#39;re the master of debunking and calling fraud, just prove to me the earth moves and not the firment. Explain that as we hurdle through space for thousands of years, certain star alignments, known as constellations, because they&#39;re constant, ever has and will be, don&#39;t shift. I mean, what&#39;s the odds of the whole universe moving in such perfect precision to maintain these observations for literally thousands of years. But you&#39;re right. You do this community a service by dving ppl like me and telling them not to ask questions about all that stuff. Nothing that isn&#39;t full of hate is ligit. Everything is the evil jews. </p>

Check out Eric Dubay videos on youtube, check out stars are souls, hell just honestly research it for a week and do mental experiments. If I were a psyop what would there be to gain? The only gain I want are more people waking up to the reality and the harsh truth that what we (you and me both) have to do is admit we were wrong we have been lied to and the earth is for us not the 1%. This place is ours to enjoy, to plant seeds, to eat plants and not sentient beings, to love and care for one another, for truth to be spread more than the current paradigm of lies.</p>

No, I think that there is plenty of truth in the teachings of Christ but I have 0 faith in being saved by this man/god, I truly believe it is up to us as physically incarnate spiritual beings to help free our brothers and sisters from the tyranny we are already seeing around us and growing at this time. </p>

<p>The truth shall set you free, and flat earth is truth albeit at first a very hard pill to swallow. It is also one that is the hardest to spread, I have had my life threatened, loss of family and friends over this but I am not going to stop ever until this is known by the 99%.</p>

It is Lucifer who writes these laws via his freemason sun worshipping children.

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnzUgKZ8m2k">High altitude horizon</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLlNKy5j_O8">Superior &quot;mirage&quot;</a></li>
</ul>

<p>These two videos are conclusive proof. The horizon cannot be flat and eye level above the ground unless you&#39;re on a flat plane. The superior &quot;mirage&quot; demonstrates seeing over impossible distances. Whether you continue to deny is on you, but the weight of evidence is on our side.</p>

Do not allow an authority to dictate to you what is true, especially for this issue.  Also, consider the post history of the OP and what his motivations are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve really noticed a huge uptick in these flat earth posts in the past couple weeks. Before it was hollow earth, and now it&#39;s flat earth. They don&#39;t want to discuss and debate about their <em>theory</em>. They&#39;re like evangelicals, they want to push their <em>truth</em> down your throat.</p>

<p>And not one of them has told me how flat earth is a conspiracy. A conspiracy is a secret plan or meeting by two or more people with the intent to cause harm or wrongdoing. I fail to see how this information could cause harm or wrongdoing. It would just be some ridiculous April Fools prank. I&#39;m done discussing with them, and I do down vote all of their posts because all it seems to me is they are here to discredit this sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pretty late to the party but I took a brief look, and the pro-flat earthers seem to rally around some universal formula that describes a perfect sphere (something like 8 inches per mile).</p>

<p>Well, the fact is our globe isn&#39;t a sphere - it&#39;s a WGS 1984, EPSG:4326 (oblate spheroid) which certainly includes flat sections.  This is most definitely an organized disinfo campaign to associate conspiracy with flat earthers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel we need to establish where the conspiracy is which means one of them needs to come forth with it, not present a damn 3 hour long YouTube video and say the evidence is in there. If they cant, then they can make their own sub and get out.</p>

The former thinks that the earth is moving up and there is no gravity but a constant 9.8m/s2 upward push (ridiculous and discredits true flat earthers).
