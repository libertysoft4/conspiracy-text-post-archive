<p>I hope you know that I&#39;m just pulling your leg man, I&#39;m actually 25% Ashkenazi. Equating Anti-Zionism with Anti-Semitism takes the same mental acrobatics as equating Anti-KKK with Anti-White. One is a huge group of people with diverse thoughts and beliefs and the other is a cultish radical group of violent racists. </p>

<p>Imagine if anyone who spoke out against the KKK was deemed an Anti-White terrorist, how fucking stupid would that be? Same deal, different words. The only difference is that the KKK was never in charge of a country.</p>

<p>Yourself, then others. You need to throw away everything you think you know about yourself, the world around you, and come to terms with what is <em>beyond</em> you. You need to identify with what you are trying to accomplish, understand your intentions and probable results, and act in a manner that does not violate others to accomplish it. You need to identify that which is not working and remove it; the pain you will experience is called growth. Do not throw away things that are working; instead improve them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are trying to &quot;wake&quot; people correct? It&#39;s directly related to your post. You are talking about educating people. This is your stated intention. In order to educate them in this instance you need to educate yourself to make sure that you aren&#39;t spitting ridiculous nonsense. </p>

<p>How is their media controlled? By what means are these carried out? Is there certain phrasings or language that people should look out for? Are you trying to tell them that they are propagating false events, or trying to steer events into a certain narrative? How are narratives deconstructed? </p>

<p>The one-word encapsulation I offered to this idea of helping to wake others is educate. If I was to approach you in the street you should be able to answer all of my questions convincingly or you have already failed the first step. You need to refine and test your statements for effect and consequence, you need to able able to talk to people or you are shooting yourself in the foot before you even begin. Why would I not immediately dismiss you if you cannot formulate a proper response to a simple dialogue? </p>

<p>Wrong. I said &quot;Maybe&quot; inferring a suggestion. I just wanted feedback to the suggestion in question, not some random, unsolicited advice from an internet stranger. If you have something to say, stick to the point.</p>
