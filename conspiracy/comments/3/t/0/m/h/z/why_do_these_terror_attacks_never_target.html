    <div class="md"><p>OK after some thought: It might be that Governments and terrorist organizations &quot;bargain&quot; with each other (not necessarily directly). The governments want the public to feel as though they need they need protection, while the terrorist organizations want their own continued existence and public support from radicals, simultaneously increasing their own power. </p>

<p>I&#39;m trying to understand what the terrorists organizations receive from not targeting governments directly. Could it be because they know they could easily be wiped out with military power if they did? That&#39;s how I think of their relationship, terrorists organizations stay alive as long as they strike fear in people while increasing the power that governments have over their own people.</p>

<p>Does that sound right? I&#39;m trying to sort out my own thoughts on this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s time that we avoided using the word &#39;terrorist&#39;, as most people&#39;s definition of the word has been fed to them by a decade of propoganda. English settlers escaping tyrannical rule of Britain would have been labeled as &#39;terrorists&#39;, and now the the hundreds of thousands of displaced refugees and victims of the West&#39;s crazed and destructive search for power and complete domination have a better chance at being labeled as a &#39;terrorist&#39; than those who truly pull the trigger.</p>

<p>We can take something like ISIS (formed entirely by the West and allies such as Saudi Arabia &amp; Israel, and funded directly and indirectly by the like) and compare it to things like the cartels in Mexico, and we get a different idea of what a &#39;terrorist organization&#39; acts like. Mexican cartels put the mutilated body of any government official or political influencer who does not cooperate on display as a bloodied and decapitated example to those who threaten the existence of the organization itself. This is never doubted and the examples of this corruption are many and horrific.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the evidence of the existence of ISIS and it&#39;s &#39;terrorist&#39; actions are consistenly inaccurate, and it acts using questionable resources such as American made vehicles and weaponry and financing from notable countries and powerful entities.</p>

<p>Though western government is mostly responsible for BOTH of these organizations, the problem with ISIS and this current spread of &#39;terrorism&#39; is that it&#39;s illegitimacy is so transparent that the fact that it&#39;s working is disheartening. With so much about ISIS left to be questioned, videos of executions and propoganda constantly being called out; there is some intelligence insulting information available about these &#39;terrorist organizations&#39;, and the fact that most people believe it speaks for itself about what&#39;s left of our passion for truth and consciousness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It may be the certain politicians capitalise on a fear sentiment to spout tough on terrorism rhetoric but defer practical strategy to the MIC, which through a hierarchical compartmentalised structure, defers power to a select group of &#39;any means necessary&#39; group of global strategists, who work in concert with governments and financial, media, arms and radical organisations to manipulate those original lazy politicians. </p>

<p>Though I think it&#39;s likely that those at the top also have assets as politicians and they are all negatively aligned in a paradigm of domination and control. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>With &#39;themself&#39; I&#39;m referring to the entire elite who are in the know of the global agenda. I have to make clear that not <em>every</em> CEO of every company in the world is &#39;in on the game&#39; so to say. So they could very well be a target. But the same thing could be said for politicians, bankers or military people.</p>

<p>Hmm I&#39;m starting to understand how you arrived at your questions and argument.</p>

<p>Reminder that the thread starter specifically put &quot;terror attacks&quot; in quote, he is implying that he is aware that these are orchestrated false flag attacks. I am speaking from <em>that</em> side of the fence. Speaking with the knowledge that these false flags are carried out for specific agendas which we are seeing unfolding day by day.
But I can totally see your point now. I admit that I am a bit baffled right now because I couldn&#39;t immediately understand and answer your question, it really made me think. If these are indeed false flag events, why not attack high-profile people? Very good point.
Maybe having the general public as a target makes putting people into a state of fear and uncertainty easier? Since higher-ups are an extreme minority and the general public is everyone. This would make it easier to garner support or acceptance for their imposed solutions like more surveillance or invasions, because everybody feels threatened.
You have made me re-think this, very good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think about it like this: lone wolf terrorism is a sole proprietorship, which means you can afford and have access to 1) gun, 2) bullets, 3) accessories, 4) homemade, primitve bombs.  </p>

<p>So whenever there&#39;s actual terrorism (not mass shooting), use of a powerful bomb for instance, you know that they stole it from the military or they are part of the military or they have military connections of some sort.  If they stole those bombs, that means a small militia or mafia is needed---which means you need lots of money if it&#39;s not an ideological militia.  Even still, a well intentioned but low-skill ideological militia that is self-supporting in terms of money, will get exactly nowehere when it comes to say, &#39;robbing a national guard armory&#39; or some other quartermaster with advanced milititary grade explosives as these places are actually very secure.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m getting at is that terrorism requires 1) money, 2) mliitary skill, 3) manpower (mercenaries).  This means the operation will cost a lot of money for all 3, and all 3 are needed for success.</p>

<p>It&#39;s almost a mathematical proof then, to say that terrorism is always funded by a financial elite and it&#39;s victims are nearly always <em>not the financial elite</em>.  Otherwise, it&#39;s not terrorism, it&#39;s a robbery, the details of which are often undisclosed so that another group will not be able to do it again.</p>

<p>In other words, terrorism is an instrument used by the rich caste to wage illegitimate / unofficial war on the middle / poor castes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well if you&#39;re putting it that way I&#39;m willing to keep this talk going. You should have made this clear from the beginning instead of taking a fighting stance.</p>

<p>In your previous post you implied that either bankers perform out these attacks or that they gain profit from terrorist attacks... This issue has never been about the banker. When I first said &quot;They would never attack themself&quot; I refered to the people working in their own system. Which could also include <em>some</em> bankers. Not that bankers carried out terrorist attacks. Or CEO&#39;s from other companies for that matter.</p>

<p>Your question of what gains do they make from terrorist attacks isn&#39;t relevant to this discussion. It has nothing to do with why they are not attacked.</p>

<p>Citizens of these countries are mostly not &quot;people who matter.&quot; If you attack the &quot;people who matter&quot; you aren&#39;t going to make the average Joe as scared as you do when you kill someone who makes them all say &quot;Holy shit, that could have been me.&quot;</p>

<p>If their goal is to scare a population, attacking civilians almost always makes the most sense. Not only that, but they are usually the easiest targets too.</p>

<p>Why would Muslims want to scare the population?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This seems an odd question coming from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. We talk about &#39;false flags&#39; and how they are used to scare the population into acquiescing what the government wants. It&#39;s the same idea here, they are scaring the population into demanding or acting in a way they want. One of the theories of ISIS is that they want to drive a wedge between Muslims and the West. They <em>want</em> the West to hate Islam, so they can turn around and say &quot;see? They hate you because of your religion. It&#39;s us against them!&quot; making it easier for them to get willing recruits, rather than having to force people into helping them through fear of violence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If they are going to attack anyone, it would be the people actually oppressing them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not necessarily. This would be one strategy, but if you cannot win by attacking the actual oppressors, there are other strategies as well, as stated above.</p>

<p>For another, the point is to put the fear of &quot;God&quot; into the common folk. If you strike at high-profile targets, the damage is relatively contained - you had a single mark and focused on it. When people see it, they get scared and go &quot;Oh shit, look at what those guys pulled off! What if they started doing that to the rest of us?&quot; But if you target a site, as opposed to a person, the damage is everyone that happened to be there at the time. Not only that, now that you&#39;re targeting the regular folk, they start thinking that <em>they</em> could be one of the next 30-something fleshy smears on the pavement. Works a lot better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That may be the origins of the word, but I don&#39;t know anyone who isn&#39;t fresh out of boot camp that would consider an O-3 to be considered brass. </p>

<p>An O-5 has considerably more clout than an O-3. I&#39;m only familiar with the navy, since that&#39;s the branch that I was in, but an O-3 is likely to be a division officer, where an O-5 is a department head.  </p>

<p>O-3 is the last promotion for officers before they have to be chosen. Up to O-3, it is automatic, as long as they don&#39;t lose their eligibility. </p>

<p>At this point, I don&#39;t even know if we are arguing the same point or not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s why it&#39;s &#39;terror&#39;ism.  When people are targeted for no reason, what can you do to be safe?  The politicians, the military, and to a certain extent the bankers, are aware of the risk their jobs and their actions entail.  They knowingly put themselves at risk in order to do what they need to do, and while it&#39;s scary to think that such highly protected people can be touched, it&#39;s scarier to think that <em>you</em> might be a target.</p>

<p>The terror comes from the idea that no one is safe- a school teacher in Iowa is at much risk as a guy directing drones at the Pentagon.</p>

<p>Aside from the psychological aspect, the political pressure exerted by a whole country of unhappy, scared people is pretty powerful.  Consider the repercussions of say, 9/11 compared to the Kennedy assassination.  Both are the kind of events where people can remember exactly where they were when they found out, but one resulted in nationwide mourning and the other resulted in a decade of widespread policy changes and war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>at least people are asking Why they would have done this type of attack this time. its highly coordinated yet some how bumbling enough to wear masks, yet bring their passports.</p>

<p>convenient how it targets the progressive parts of france, the same people who are probably most likely to be against military intervention in syria. seem like exactly the wrong group for ISIS to target if they want to keep france out of the fight.</p>

<p>why would ISIS a group already being battered and broken by russian/syrian/iranian forces, and the occasional strike from the US on civilian power plant, want to escalate with france?  what the hell do they gain from it? is there not enough explosions already raining on them?</p>

<p>but look at who really benefits from the aftermath, france is now &quot;at WAR!!!&quot; something their public has been resisting, all of a sudden nationalist groups have the &quot;reason&quot; to start the push to lock the immigrants and refugees up and blame them. obviously this also drags NATO in to the mix, &quot;an attack on one, is an attack on all&quot; right... so now we have NATOs entrance in to syria in some quasi legal attempt at legitimizing it. completely eclipsed the beirut bombings, the attack on the russian airliner, bringing the focus of the media back to the valiant NATO forces who must immediately remove Assad and his terrible regime (some of you might even then ask &quot;but wait didn&#39;t ISIS bomb them&quot;)</p>

<p>but hey, lets just sit back and see what happens. watch whose interests flourish in the aftermath.</p>

<p>Why do these &quot;terror attacks&quot; never target politicians, bankers, CEOs, military brass and the like?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because in order to generate raw fear you have to make it appear that ordinary people just like you and I are in danger. If you attack high-profile establishment figures, then these people are only semi-real anyway (i.e. you&#39;ve only heard about them in the media and/or seen them on TV) so the psychological effect isn&#39;t as strong.</p>

<p>You&#39;re basically trying to create the impression that it could be you or I.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL QUESTION AND IT IS VERY IMPORTANT !!!
I see many answers that show the technique at work.
Terrorists - actual terrorists - are not out to cause panic amongst the everyday you and I public.  I would say more actual terrorists are political.  IRA  - Irish terrorism for example.  Political and social and religious and historically motivated bombings.  Yes, indeed, everyday people were killed and/or injured in the troubles in Ireland between catholics and protestants etc etc but  - check this up - the IRA directly went for the English establishment - They attacked the whole Tory party conference and the Royal family members.  As I say, there are other times in public places but the lives of the public were more used as a tool to threaten the power people..not the same patterns as current events whatsoever.  Is worth researching.<br/>
If you are so motivated , politically, you are not daft about your politics and power structures.<br/>
The modern events have very little historical backbone , make no actual sense (hate us for our freedoms...ehm....fuck off) and seem to follow a pattern or have distinguishing copycat features (passports, drills, already being watched or otherwise involved with the intelligence agencies etc etc etc ).  Think about it - a bona fide terrorist would THRIVE on the element of surprise - not follow a checklist.</p>

<p>It really is a terrible big lot of shite we are being told - Most of our authorities have been , more or less, sold out or infiltrated by people who - honestly - are fucking ruthless, have not an iota of care at all about us or our people getting blown to smithereens , at home or in foreign places , they control the governments, the media , the military, education, they want more control of this - me, writing to you - the internet is a nightmare to them.  The more you study power systems and how they actually think and their histories and blood stained wealth accumulation stories and less and less the tactics work on your fear and bewilderment.  xx
One last thing, use this tool of the net for all it is worth and run in the opposite direction from mainstream tv and news and don&#39;t just go along with what the majority are going along with, because they are trusting people who probably never deserved our trust in the first place.  History shouts loud and clear - question your authorities!!!  If doing so makes you a freakzoid tinfoiler , so be it.  If you hate tinfoilers, fuck off our reddit .  ok nuff said</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I may get down voted for this but a thought just occurred to me.  We were labeled as terrorists or more to the point, enemies without morals during the revolutionary war because we chose to fight with gorilla tactics.  Hiding in trees and such.  We did not fight using the established rules of war.</p>

<p>These people are inflicting the most damage they can in the only way they can.  They cannot attack our military bases.  They cannot attack our leaders.  They attack us.  As purely an academic thought, is this the new face of war?  If your not a super power and don&#39;t have a military, how would you fight a war against a super power?  I am guessing it would look a lot like this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, leaders can be replaced. It&#39;s not like if you killed the president that we wouldn&#39;t elect a new one, or as emergency procedures have it, he&#39;s replaced by the vice president or speaker of the house. Very few countries in the west still have kings or queens. This is one of the reasons that conspiracy theories are a complete joke. If there are puppet masters behind the scenes pulling the strings then any puppet will do.</p>

<p>Secondly, Islamic militants consider everyone that doesn&#39;t believe the same things they do to be the enemy. Killing Joe Schmo on teh street is just as important as killing a political leader. Every infidel put in a body bag to them is a win. Seriously though, with CEOs and world leaders infinitely replaceable through already established law, what importance would one guy, no matter how talented be?</p>

<p>Third: yeah, they do target these kinds of people. 9/11 they toppled the Twin Towers, a very important financial symbol and hub in the west. Another plane hit the pentagon. Charlie Hebdo prints cartoons critical of their religion and they attack them. These guys also can&#39;t stand themselves some jews.</p>

<p>Last and not least, they&#39;d love to kill everyone in Israel. The fact of the matter just remains that Israel and western militaries are so much stronger than them that they&#39;d instantly be defeated in open battle.</p>

<p>This is just an enemy that has cartoonish black and white beliefs and is very determined to kill people. Like, spending every waking moment thinking about how to murder someone determined.</p>

<p>You are assuming none of these killed people are muslims. There has been a confirmed dead Turkish girl in these Paris attacks recently.</p>

<p>You are full of shit. Killing random people in the streets and theatres but not bothering to check their religious background? Yeah totally fits in with the idea of killing everyone that doesn&#39;t believe the same thing they do.
With this logic you are actually implying these terrorists do an in-depth check on the people they &#39;randomly&#39; kill. Making sure that each and every one of them is not muslim. Unbelievable, the mental gymnastics you do.</p>

If other &quot;righteous Muslims&quot; are collateral damage in their attacks, their sacrifice is in the service of a greater good.  That&#39;s what they believe, and how they justify killing innocent Muslims.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Quite literally, the term &quot;brass&quot; refers to the fact that officers have pins made out of brass (or at least did when the term came into favor, I can&#39;t say for sure what they are made out of now).</p>

<p>But anyway, I thought I had edited. The highest rank was actually a Lt Colonel, not Captain. Although, you still wouldn&#39;t consider that high enough, I imagine.</p>

<p>But, that being said, they did fly a plane into the Pentagon on 9/11. So who got shot at Ft Hood doesn&#39;t really change the fact high level military personnel were, in fact, targeted.</p>
