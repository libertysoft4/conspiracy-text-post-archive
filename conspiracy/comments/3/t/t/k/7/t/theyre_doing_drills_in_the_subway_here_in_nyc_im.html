    <div class="md"><p>Let me explain myself a little, I&#39;ve never done this before...I&#39;ve never posted anything here before today.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been reading r/conspiracy every day for years. I am a thirty-something woman living in Manhattan and until now, I have felt relatively safe. I know 9/11 was an inside job, I know that MSM is poison, I know the world bank dominates all, etc. This does not mean that I don&#39;t live in a cozy bubble that will be popped one day. </p>

<p>The drills that are happening right now scare the shit out of me. I have not seen this much police presence ever, and I was born here. On Meet the Press this morning Police Chief Bratton was so confident that the NYPD had everything under control, but his tone and demeanor was so forced and ingenuine. How can he possibly think that? And what can I possibly do about it?</p>

<p>I will try and take photos and videos of anything I know to be suspicious. Suspicious from our police force, and our government. </p>

<p>Thank you for listening, and commenting, and supporting that this is a real threat. That this is just the beginning. Or the end. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you and welcome.  Some of us aren&#39;t dicks here.  Please contribute more, especially the pics and videos.  I can say I&#39;m very fascinated by this. </p>

<p>I have only been back to NYC once since 9/11, last year, and it was a <em>very</em> strange experience for me.  Firstly, I was suicidal for many reasons so I went to NYC to receive ketamine therapy around wall st.  It was profoundly psychedelic, and a lot of feelings around 9/11 came up in fact.  During that week, there was construction in the subway, so my route back to NJ hotel where I was staying was different every day.  Under ketamine, this is like waking up to a new universe every time.  Really feels that way.  I thought living in NYC would be very difficult having this level of dynamism in daily life.  It kind of fixates you into the moment, doesn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>While I was there I visited the wtc complex.  The area around 9/11 memorial was cordoned off, making people spiral around an visually-obfuscating barrier to the memorial there, which is symbolic of the kaaba (black square pond with plaques of the deceased encircling it).  So many policemen, din and confusion; so many people enculcated into the bodysnatched version of reality wanting to participate in the spectacle.  I spoke with a policeman to see &#39;if it was worth waiting so long to see&#39;, and decided it wasn&#39;t, so I moved on.</p>

<p>What I noticed more than anything was there were militarized police everywhere.  Darkened glass security booths in the wall st. district.  Cameras everywhere, appearing as even more sinister and plotting than the architectural gargoyles who share the same parapets.  </p>

<p>When I was at a walmart just across the river in seacaucus NJ, five tan chinooks emerged from a base to the north and flew directly overhead, only about 150&#39; high, nearly grazing the store, and flew towards wall st. area of manhattan.  </p>

<p>A year prior to that, in aurora, Co, I found myself in traffic with a tank.  Yes, they had black swat assault vehicles about 5x larger than a regular car.  It was ridiculous.  I rolled my eyes thinking, &#39;well this is going to have to stop&#39;.  But it didn&#39;t.  It only got more and more.</p>

<p>I thought this was excessive and it really kind of pissed me off.  I was told the chinooks were some kind of touch and go practice drill they do all the time.  No wonder people are driven insane.  If the noise doesn&#39;t do it, it&#39;s the dread of feeling greatly overpowered by our hyperspending on military.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Touch and goes  / drills might be necessary but when they are done excessively they feel a lot like a thinly-veiled threat against people as a form of social control</p>

<p>Please don&#39;t encourage the fear-mongering and &quot;you will be thrown in a black van for taking a picture or asking a question!&quot; kind of train of thought. I know you were joking/being hyperbolic in the first half of your comment but this mindset in itself proves that their propaganda is working - if everyday citizens are scared to photograph signs and police activity. </p>

<p>So many people are constantly taking photos throughout New York City. Hell, tourists often ask the machine-gun-toting cops around 34th-42nd street to pose with them, and I&#39;ve often seen them do it with no complaint. </p>

<p>Sure, there are a ton of bad apples in the NYPD...but there is also a large number of men and women who are legitimately trying to protect the citizens of New York City and get up every morning and go to work with the best intentions in mind...which HAS to be hard to do in this day and age. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean I&#39;m not just making that up for a kick, I&#39;ve seen videos of people harassed by cops for taking video under the suspicion of planning an act of terrorism. 9/11 had that awful effect on people, that&#39;s why they did it. They instilled that notion that even your neighbor could be planning an act of terror, and in doing so they have been able to divide and conquer. But I never said all cops are bad, I&#39;ve encountered many great ones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get it. </p>

<p>But out of curiosity...do you live in NYC or do you just know all of these things from videos you&#39;ve seen? That shit MAY happen 1/100,000 times...or it may be much more likely to happen to some &quot;I know my rights so I&#39;m gunna put this camera in your face officer and there&#39;s nothing you can do about it!&quot; douche who gets a trip off of flexing his rights well knowing what is likely to happen by doing so in an aggressive manner. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve lived here the entire 27 years of my life and yes - the city has lost all of that beautiful pre-911 character it had and there are cops everywhere but if you&#39;re not an idiot or a loudmouth douchebag you can ask questions, take pictures, and live life normally.  </p>

<p>The only reason you should be scared to be approached by a cop is if you have something illegal on you, you&#39;re black, or worst case scenario...have something illegal on you while being black. EDIT: <em>black OR BROWN</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my original post btw I wasn&#39;t specifically talking about in NYC that he should be careful, just that taking pictures of things can look shady. But I live 15 minutes from NYC, I don&#39;t have personal experience with being harassed because I don&#39;t like to provoke people, especially cops. In fact when I drive by a cop I have mini freak outs because here in NJ they pull you over at the drop of a dime. I guess I&#39;ve had some personal experiences with cops that make me more afraid than I should be, but really I watch a lot of these videos where cops make blatant transgressions of constitutional rights of Americans. Even if they are annoying people who are passing some sort of DUI stop and aren&#39;t rolling their windows down, they maydeserve a slap in the face, but they should still have rights. </p>

<p>And really -- as annoying as these idiots are who flex their rights, they do point out something that needs more attention in our country, and that is the police force not carrying out their oath to protect and serve.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It appears that the MSM ISIS narrative is leading up to...an &quot;attack &quot; on American soil. Suddenly, after Russia destroyed ISIS in Sryia, they are suddenly hitting places all over the world, all the while threatening to hit America. The MSM is prepping the minds of Americans to be afraid of an eminent attack. I would be concerned to. The narrative is very predictable, the MSM gives out the clues of what is to happen next. If the propaganda says they&#39;re going to hit the US, then there is a chance they will.</p>

<p>However, they haven&#39;t really attacked their masters Israel, the US and Saudi Arabia. But they may, just to keep the sheep in a state of fear and confusion... and an excuse to start another war that the American absolutely don&#39;t want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Truly, from a logistical stand point how does it make sense ISIS is mounting foreign attacks when they can barely keep it together at home. Not to mention we only ever start hearing about government&#39;s thwarting terrorist attacks immediately after a high profile one. I believe its all chunked together to provide maximum emotional response and oh wow is it a year until the presidential elections? What a coincidence, no one will want to talk about social issues when we have big bad scary terrorists to worry about.</p>
