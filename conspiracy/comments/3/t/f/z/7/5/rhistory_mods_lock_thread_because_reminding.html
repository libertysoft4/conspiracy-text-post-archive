    <div class="md"><p>Gotta make sure that history doesn&#39;t get re-revised (a.k.a. corrected). If you follow the money on Pearson PLC, the worlds largest provider of educational text books, you&#39;ll notice that they have deep ties with media (Zionist Owned). Also the founder, Samuel Pearson, and his heir, have close ties to the Rothschild family. In general they have a very shady past of investing in media outlets such as the Economist, until they sold their 50% stake in the economist to the rest of the majority holders including, the Rothschild family, the Schroeder family, the Cadbury family, and the Agnelli family of Italy. When you find out what other types of investments these characters have made, it starts to become very alarming that they sit on the board of directors for a company that educates the world. </p>

However, it is important for stories like that of the USS Liberty to once again become common historical knowledge and you would think that <a href="/r/history">/r/history</a> would be an acceptable avenue for that information.</p>

<p>Maybe the OP in <a href="/r/history">/r/history</a> wasn&#39;t presented in an objective fashion and had an obvious political agenda? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just putting this out there (please read before you judge) while i agree with David Cole that the 6 million figure is absurd and that the majority of deaths were from Typhus, between 300,000-3 million Jews really were killed/starved/worked to death/thrown into filthy labor camps where a disease like Typhus could spread easily. The Nazis were thugs who really did not like the middle class and lower class jewry. They went really easy on the upper class jews (cause you know they needed money) but they definitely did target working class jews with a vengeance. So lets exercise some balance with Holocaust revisionism. Yes we were lied to by the Zionists, no that does not mean the Nazis were good people or not anti-semetic. Its also a lesson to learn from, those labor camp, fear mongering tactics will be used again in the near future either on Americans or on Arab immigrants. So please tread lightly around that subject, the line between informed truth seeker and nazi apologist is rather thin unfortunately. Also the Right Wing extremists in America and Britain are notoriously cooperative with the CIA, FBI and MI6</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll even acknowledge that the allies bombed the camps and that the Soviets were killing prisoners (they had their own little holocaust). However this idea that comes up in Holocaust revisionism that not only were no jews killed on purpose but that they wanted to be there is complete tripe. The Nazis really did despise the Jews (except the Bankers who they largely left alone) and they really did use slave labor to build their war machine (as did the allies use prison labor and the commies used gulag labor). So once again lets be balanced, i have german blood and i admire many Germans from that era who got swept up in Nazism (such as Heidegger) its just no principled to wholesale dismiss the crimes of the Nazi regime. At the very least they violated those people&#39;s rights and subjected them to inhumane housing and forced labor. At worst they starved them and allowed disease to run rampant unchecked. </p>

<p>The alternative would have been that they removed the entire post. Would you have liked that better? </p>

<p>No idea, but given the comment the mod left I am pretty sure they were dealing with such a great deal of off-topic non-historic comments that these people that failed to followed the rules ruined it for those looking for a historical discussion. </p>

<p>Even if they had left it unlocked historical discussion probably would have been nearly impossible knowing how politics is discussed on reddit. </p>

<p>All things considered I think this has been a good middle ground, since they were able to leave the post up so people looking for the subject can still see it. Wouldn&#39;t you agree? </p>

<p>Do me a favor, look at the comment count and then count the comments. Obviously they removed all the comments about current politics. </p>

<p>Well yeah, as the mod said they have no issue with political discussion in a historical context. They have an issue with current-day politics and specifically soapboxing. In other words using history as method to push their political view. Which has nothing to do with history anymore at that point. </p>

<p>The subreddit is not supposed to be used for political arguments. Are you also saying that a mod deleting a post on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> about how bad Peyton Manning played last week is also censorship? Do you understand why your logic is retarded?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll even acknowledge that the allies bombed the camps and that the Soviets were killing prisoners (they had their own little holocaust). However this idea that comes up in Holocaust revisionism that not only were no jews killed on purpose but that they wanted to be there is complete tripe. The Nazis really did despise the Jews (except the Bankers who they largely left alone) and they really did use slave labor to build their war machine (as did the allies use prison labor and the commies used gulag labor). So once again lets be balanced, i have german blood and i admire many Germans from that era who got swept up in Nazism (such as Heidegger) its just no principled to wholesale dismiss the crimes of the Nazi regime. At the very least they violated those people&#39;s rights and subjected them to inhumane housing and forced labor. At worst they starved them and allowed disease to run rampant unchecked. </p>
