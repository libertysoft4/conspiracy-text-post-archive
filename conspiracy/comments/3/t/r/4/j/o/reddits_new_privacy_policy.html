<p><strong>Your Private Information Is Never for Sale.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Certain third party sites may offer users the option to log in using their reddit id (for example, redditgifts). This option is only an authentication tool and does not transmit any new personal information to or from reddit, or give reddit access to details of subsequent actions taken on these sites.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy?v=33a67dd2-e2c6-11e4-807a-22000b248ffc">https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy?v=33a67dd2-e2c6-11e4-807a-22000b248ffc</a></p>

<p>In the new version there seem to be no such guarantees about not selling user data.</p>

<p><strong>We may partner with third-party advertisers, ad networks, and analytics providers to deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests and to better understand your use of the Services.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy?v=e8c8da2a-8faf-11e5-aac4-0eb32ca8011f">https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy?v=e8c8da2a-8faf-11e5-aac4-0eb32ca8011f</a></p>

<p>Notice how they say they are &quot;updating&quot; the privacy policy rather than taking away your privacy? </p>

<p>Seriously guys. Read them both. Maybe I&#39;m just being cynical, but it looks like a big &quot;fuck you&quot; to privacy.</p>

<p>You can say that again. There&#39;s only one reason you&#39;d erase the line: &quot;Your Private Information Is Never for Sale&quot;. And that&#39;s because you plan to sell private information.</p>

<p>Completely agree buddy. I presume they were probably thinking about money, in big capital letters. They clearly don&#39;t give a fuck about freedom of speech any more, that&#39;s for sure. </p>

<p>At this stage, I honestly wouldn&#39;t be surprised if Reddit is under some sort of economic review, and eventually ends up becoming part of the Google or Yahoo empire. But whatever the reason, they seem very eager to ramp up profitability -- and at their users&#39; expense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If by millions you mean like a whole two dollars than sure. The 4chan meme of &quot;doing it for free&quot; is not entirely baseless. Yes, all moderators commit fraud, embezzlement, tax-evasion... but it&#39;s like drug cartel. Only the higher-ups make dick at all. The bottomfeeding &quot;janitors&quot; or in most cases just forum specific mods don&#39;t make much of anything. Just the thrill of being able to be a scumbag and criminal.</p>

<p>Also there&#39;s reportfags. Honestly a moderator&#39;s job would be ten times harder without reportfags who ESPECIALLY do it for free because they&#39;re so stupid they actually think mods do anything good and won&#39;t just ban them eventually too. It&#39;s quite disgusting. The practical thing to do would be to jail and kill moderators though. Reportfags will just have to stick their thumbs up their asses when they realize there&#39;s no mafia around anymore to torment people they dislike.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Exactly. And the alternatives like Voat either have or will fall into exactly the same trap. That&#39;s why I think RMFN has a point. Not necessarily to create a site with no owners, but rather the opposite: create one whose ownership is diluted enough that site changes don&#39;t become arbitrary. There should be meetings and debates about all proposed changes, and the users themselves should be encouraged to participate in them.</p>

<p>Other than that, if you really wanted to create a free site which doesn&#39;t perpetuate the same tale of eventually selling itself out, then I think you probably only need one main rule: don&#39;t accept advertising.</p>

<p>Good point. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes. It think it is pretty clear that Reddit has made up its mind about the direction it is going to take though. The thing to be worried about is that eventually they are going to fracture this sub, and that means we become isolated individuals raging against the system rather than a strong group collective.</p>
