        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Most of us here know by now that the main-stream media is completely controlled by those in power, and that social media is being manipulated by the highest bidders (who happen to be the same people). </p>

<p>When we are talking about groups whose members&#39; identities are completely undisclosed, this makes it even easier for those with the power to spread their propaganda by taking on the voice of these groups. Do you really think announcements made by Anonymous go viral just because some guy puts on a mask, makes a video, adds a vocoder and uploads it to Youtube? No, our social media is controlled so we see what they want us to see, and they want us to see what Anonymous has been saying lately.</p>

<p>So what has Anonymous been saying? Yes, they&#39;ve been warning of planned terror attacks by ISIS. According to those announcements, many of those attacks were planned for today. But, instead of these attacks actually being carried out, the events that they were supposed to be at were cancelled, or the other areas of planned attacks were evacuated. </p>

<p>This is what TPTB want. All they have to do now is speak through Anonymous and &quot;leak&quot; whatever terror plot they come up with for whatever location and time they choose. From here they can control these masses of people through this fear. </p>

<p>Anyone who reveals information under the group &quot;Anonymous&quot; isn&#39;t some elite hacker with the secret club membership, they can be anyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly feel like the whole world is going insane, the media keeps saying that Anonymous declares this and leaks that and people don&#39;t even think about who they are.</p>

<p>Perfect example - in 2011 or so, Anonymous threatened the government of Estonia for abusing it&#39;s citizens (which I agree with). Turns out they were a group of dumb high schoolers from a town of 2000 people called Väike-Maarja. They didn&#39;t even upload their YouTube video using Tor or VPNs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah Ive been noticing alot lately the Anonymous has clearly been hijacked. Their posts on facebook seem incredibly mainstream these days mixed with some half truths. I think the started out as a voice of the people, then got infiltrated by the shadow gov&#39;t and now they are compromised. I imagine any of the real ones left have gone on to new things or groups. These arrested some people inside anon so I would imagine they broke off since then and the intelligence agencies have been using their platform.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anon is a symbol for people. Just an idea so they can look up and think there is someone fighting on a front they can&#39;t or won&#39;t. Here is the deal thou anon won&#39;t get any real shit done. </p>

<p>If anyone that was of credible then they are going to have to go public with information and face scrutiny. When you hide behind a mask what makes you different then the ring masters of the circus we call daily life? </p>

<p>It&#39;s why snowden is the biggest success of the Establishment. Made it look like he did something of real importance. Reality says otherwise. Everything he has been saying was ready known. It was talked about more so before it was confirmed. </p>

<p>Now it isn&#39;t. Now it seems that no one gives a fuck. They were given a so called gold reason and that just sat well with them. I gave up my privacy a long time ago when I got a smart phone. I can&#39;t bitch that I demand it cause I could simply get it once I detete my reddit and ditch the phone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We were speaking about leadership and determined (or clarified) that there isn&#39;t any.</p>

<p>If there isn&#39;t any leadership then they&#39;re not really a <em>voice</em> for &quot;the people.&quot; Their just a <em>voice</em> <strong>of</strong> certain people. </p>

<p>Is shutting down websites and Twitter accounts supposed to be seen as heroic and pro-people? I was thinking about how they take down a lot of KKK accounts and websites. But that just either retaliates them or makes them do more physical meetings. (or phone calls) As far as accounts and virtual presence goes, they can be wiped out. But they&#39;re still physically there, which isn&#39;t really....a change.</p>
