    <div class="md"><p>People who post stuff like this are grossly uninformed about how the media and geopolitics work.  This once again demonstrates that one of the greatest conspiracies that nobody talks about is the progressive deterioration of education in developed countries which is slowly eroding the ability of people to have the capacity for critical thought away.</p>

<p>There is a reason why murders in ghettos get less coverage than those in affluent areas.  There is a reason why terrorist attacks in developed countries get more coverage than similar attacks in war-torn or developing countries.  There is a reason why the drought in California gets more coverage than the drought in Botswana.</p>

<p>It is because the people with a greater amount of disposable income care about these issues more and therefore advertisers and the media are trying to appeal to them.  It can&#39;t be that hard to believe the concept that ratings matters, that the proliferation of ideologies that draw people to advertisers matters.  </p>

<p>You appeal to these people by showing them issues that they are more concerned about because they are closer to home and therefore easier to relate to.  These events are happening in places where in the minds of the public <strong>they aren&#39;t supposed to be happening</strong>.  Currently, people are supposed to feel safer in Paris than they do in Kenya, therefore it&#39;s far more shocking when something happens in Paris, a place that people are <strong>fleeing these kinds of attacks to get to</strong>, and because of that, it generates far more coverage.  I mean people are literally risking their lives to flee Syria and other countries in the hundreds of thousands to get away from terrorist/other attacks, come to a place where they are supposed to feel safe, which is then subsequently attacked and you are surprised that it is generating so much coverage?  Really???</p>

<p>It&#39;s unbelievable to me that people don&#39;t understand why the Paris attacks get more coverage than similar attacks in third-world countries, it demonstrates that the education is failing people so horribly that they are unable to reach logical conclusions for themselves anymore.</p>

<p>Yes.  It is one of the fundamental reasons behind why the development of a better functioning society is as stifled as it currently is in parts of the Western world.  Rather than focusing on issues actually relevant to the progress of society, some relatively powerful parts of the world are debating ridiculous issues like whether creationism should be included in textbooks and are unable to see how this hurts the educational system as a whole.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right.

<p>Don&#39;t derail this into a political correctness debate. </p>

<p>My point is that you want the populace think more critically, but your condescending attitude actively harms that goal. If you make someone feel terrible for asking a question, then they&#39;re less likely to ask questions or speak up in the future for fear of ridicule. That&#39;s not political correctness run amok; that&#39;s basic human psychology and education 101.</p>

<p>I was attempting to demonstrate that the overly coddling nature of many Western educational systems is actually doing more damage than it is good and that much of this is coming under the guise of political correctness.</p>

<p>I guess this is where we have a fundamental disagreement.  I firmly believe that there is such thing as a &quot;stupid question&quot; and will treat them as such in the hopes that it will drive somebody to consider doing some of their own research and find their own answers prior to asking them.  </p>

<p>People are different, many people who fear ridicule will use that motivation to improve in whatever arena that fear happens to occur in.  Others will use it as an excuse to stop trying, or become &quot;less likely to ask questions&quot;.  I prefer to appeal to the former.</p>

<p>More thinly-veiled personal attacks, nice work.  If you would look beyond your personal bias in terms of what you think of me you would see that I&#39;m not trying to dissuade people from asking questions.  I&#39;m merely trying to get people to take a few steps towards learning the answer themselves before posing them, especially in a place which prides itself on being a &quot;thinking ground&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because attack on Paris is attack on NATO and other first world countries. As unfortunate as it is, terrorist attacks are quite common in middle east or even Pakistan but no one give a shits about, which is hypocrite but you also can&#39;t deny the fact that west shares more common values and so they support each other in tough times. If there is an attack in America, you won&#39;t see anyone marching/solidarity in Pakistan or Iran. In fact, many people were in those nations were actually happy that something like 9/11 happened.</p>

<p>finally got it to open.  the video was gone.  saw this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In Beirut, even Christians celebrated the atrocity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and still no mention of numbers.</p>

<p>but since we are pointing our fingers as people celebrating the event:</p>

<p><a href="http://whatreallyhappened.com/WRHARTICLES/fiveisraelis.html">http://whatreallyhappened.com/WRHARTICLES/fiveisraelis.html</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/2012/11/08/911-dancing-israelis-phony-lawsuit/">http://www.veteranstoday.com/2012/11/08/911-dancing-israelis-phony-lawsuit/</a></p>

<p>I don&#39;t doubt a few &quot;muslims&quot; were dancing -- along with a few Christians (according to your own source) and a few Jews (according to my source).  So...what&#39;s your point, exactly?</p>
