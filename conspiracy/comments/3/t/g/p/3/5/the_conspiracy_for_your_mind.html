        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Government tries to control the animalistic side of human beings by manufacturing control over the lives of every individual. </p>

<p>Corporations try to over inflate our ego, appeal to our sexual drive, our animalistic desires and make us obsessive, so they may remain the middle man between us and nature, and keep us buying things.</p>

<p>Religion makes taboo the animalistic and prideful side of human beings, making a repressive and neurotic beast incapable of objective reasoning. </p>

<p>All fight nature. </p>

<p>The natural man, untouched by societal beliefs, is at balance with his carnal and spiritual sides, his light and his dark side, his emotional and logical sides, the natural man is inherently innocent. Satisfaction is found easily for the man who says he has enough, but society tells us nothing is ever enough.  </p>

<p>Our minds get conditioned, and are able of producing emotions from purely imagined ideas. Just imagining what hell would be like, our minds are capable of imagining and feeling what endless torment and suffering feels like. Through constant reiteration of emotion producing propaganda, our minds develops a sense of what reality is, a paradigm of limitations, rose or grey tinted glasses. </p>

<p>The reality you have been presented is a lie, only nature and objectivity will teach you truth. </p>

<p>Being objective about your personal identity will lead you to realize your inherent independence from beliefs of others, cults of personality, from definitions and limitations. </p>

<p>By the very creation of an identity, by definition, you are creating self imposed limitations on self expression that leads to emotional withdrawal, and emotional barriers that act like stress conductors. The constant defence of that identity incites the fight or flight response as we have mistaken ourselves to a set of definitions. Attack the definitions, you attack the egotistical animal. </p>

<p>The relinquishing of ego, as almost every religion and hallucinogenic drug user aims to do, is done by the relinquishing of thoughts and notions of self. </p>

<p>Thoughts and notions of self, and attachment to a subjective reality, act like barriers to full experience, peace, full expression of self, honesty, objectivity, compassion, joy and true knowledge.</p>

<p>Objectively, the only difference between any two people is their body and mind. Their spirit, or heart, their capacity for compassion, imagination, virtue, self expression and their desire for love and family cannot be determined by superficial measures. </p>

<p>Objectively, we are more than animals, capable of extreme stress and trauma, capable of extreme compassion and freewill, capable of experiencing mental torment. </p>

<p>Freewill is being hijacked by the impulses and desires of the body and mind constantly. Reacting to experience, anger, lust, jealousy, egotism, aversion and attachment rise up and take over. Through non reaction to the mental chatter and cravings of the body, our mind becomes capable of peace, capable of complete freewill. </p>

<p>You&#39;re a slave, in the cosmic sense you&#39;re a slave to hunger, cravings, impulses, your fight or flight response, attachments, aversions, dependency, identity, self imposed limitations, addictions, and to anything that will feed you, promise you sex and house you, you&#39;re natures plaything, a living being plopped here with no warning or preparation, with no knowledge or know how. </p>

<p>If money is a tool of evil, bankers are the demons who created it and you&#39;re the sucker for buying in. </p>

<p>The central bank owners make money from the inflation and deflation of the dollar, while also getting interest from loaning our country money. While the beast that is America breathes, the central bankers float even higher on an endless pork barrel of tax payers money. </p>

<p>The government signs your child over to act as an I.O.U. to the central bank in the form of your birth certificate and social security number. </p>

<p>And if the government is part of some sort of new world agenda, bent on making Israel and America the ones in control of the world through international banking, Interpol, trade agreements, and currency depreciation in third world countries that produce our 5 dollar shirts, then you&#39;re a slave to that agenda as well, if you didn&#39;t live a life in a pack of wolves and had any involvement in the exchange of money, your very life acts like the blood to whatever agenda the government wants. </p>

<p>By the very fact we are living a physical reality, we are a slave. If we develop a subjective reality from life, we become slaves to our subjectivity. </p>

<p>The escape is through meditation, and you&#39;ll know I&#39;m no shill when I say you can meditate anywhere, anytime, completely free. Meditation is the only way to break the thoughts, ego, and belief from having control over emotions and body felt energies. It is the only way to become at peace with the constant cravings of the body and the tense energy that develops from being in a constant state of stress, fear, and anger, which stress, fear and anger are the controls by which you are manipulated into accepting subjective realities, ones that detract from objectivity. </p>

<p>Religion, corporations, government, banking, media, all detract and deviate from objectivity in order to create a set of subjective beliefs that come packaged in a pretty little bow, every time any of the front men for these institutions open their mouths. Dictating the narrative of Reddit, Facebook, and the internet in total has been a great control over the emotional climate of the world, just like putting fluoride in the water to reduce aggression, but they are creating racial climate necessary for the support of war is being manufactured every second of every day.<br/>
The more hot topics there are, the more we will divide. Abortion, Isis, the middle east, gay marriage, religion, class, race, police state, nwo, right vs left, merry Christmas vs happy holidays, coffee cups, sports teams, and whether we should deport everyone, has served only to divide us into cults of personality, fighting amongst ourselves, over problems that keep us blind to the direction the world is going, blind to the reality of our slavery, blind to the obvious, objective truth that this is a shared experience of life and the truth that the world only works because we are cooperating, we are dependent on one another to create a standard of living a modern society is capable of having, we are on the brink of world peace, at any moment any individual can become aware of their harmful actions and put an end to them for the sake of peace. </p>

<p>We are not getting the message out that we want peace, we have been manipulated to crave the blood of the enemies we have been told to hate, and manipulated to continue their agenda by fueling the divide.</p>

<p>Well said, but how does one meditate successfully?  I have attempted to numerous times and never been able to get where I am trying to go. It sounds great, I am just frustrated after trying and failing numerous times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You meditate by simply focusing on the present, you&#39;ve got to eliminate the chatter in your mind by being mindful of the present moment. For some it comes easy others it&#39;s difficult. </p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t natural when I started, but it wasn&#39;t long till I was successful and it became natural. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s actually a good thing though to completely clear your mind this way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like to compare the mind to a child, a child cries when it&#39;s hurt, wants praise for its good, wants understanding, wants validation, wants pleasure and avoids displeasure. </p>

<p>The minds chatter and the energy of the body act as distractions from direct experience of consciousness, the self that is without definitions. </p>

<p>To sit and simply endure the barrage of thoughts, emotions, feelings and the energy of the body without reaction until the barrage becomes no more, we become capable of higher consciousness. Direct experience of consciousness is through thoughtlessness. Uninhibited self expression is achieved when we dissolve the filters of our perception, and rid ourselves of subjectivity. You are inherently an individual with an inner world all your own, and yet any content added to your inner world is superfluous, it is the white nothingness from the movie the matrix that can summon anything imaginable. </p>

<p>Our adversary, the ego, is the minds incessant stream of thoughts of personal identity, thoughts we have bought into with our emotions, beliefs and feelings. Sitting and being aware of the voice that says, &quot;you are this or that&quot; without reaction, and you come to make the distinction between you, the observer and your object of awareness, thoughts. </p>

<p>It is through the disempowerment of mental constructs and the minds capacity to control our emotions, that we learn self mastery. </p>

<p>I believe the whole universe is conscious to some degree, if everything is consciousness, then that means everything imagined, since it is energy, is just as real as anything physical. Your inner world is real, it affects you, which affects actions, which affects the worldly chain of events that lead to global well being or despair. This is an objective truth we try to deny to ourselves so that we can morally live a selfish/self centered life.</p>

<p>Making the inner world a tranquil, free, self expressive kingdom, open to experience, love, compassion, expansion, growth, balance, harmony, we then bring our inner world into actualization through a lifetime of tiny actions that could culminate into world peace. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For some, their inner world is such a dark and horrible place overcome with chaos and turmoil that they spread corruption, misery and tragedy wherever they attribute their energy. </p>

<p>Sometimes it seems like the only defense people with love and peace in their hearts have against these demons is avoidance, because if we engage in their game, their darkness will corrupt us.  To fight the beast, you have to become the beast.  If we avoid the beast it only grows stronger. </p>

<p>In the battle between good and evil, evil will always have the upper hand because love is a choice, fear is not.  Fear can be forced on you </p>

<p>How are we supposed to fix the world when the enemy has to choose to accept our weapon , yet we can&#39;t choose, due to our nature, to ignore theirs? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can only speak for myself. I&#39;ve explored the dark side to its end, the forbidden aspects of ourselves, demons and arch demons, and came to realize the dark is limited, it never wins out. </p>

<p>I literally feel like there was a spiritual war over my soul, and the good side won out, I&#39;m increasingly attributing that to shroom trips. But the dark side has no power, it&#39;s weak, even the inner darkness is built on illusion. There never really is complete darkness, just a lack of light, and even a single proton hurling through space is an illumination unto itself.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly this. This is at the crux of the problem, we are being encouraged/rewarded by acting on our vices, so that the Satanists who are ruling the world, devoid of empathy, compassion, love can make us just like them. Being good is not incentivised in the current system that they have built and forced us all to be a part of. And worse, they have made it illegal to want to opt out.

<p>I try and make sure I put my intention out there that I do not comply to the propaganda being manufactured. It&#39;s intention to dis-empower us through fear will not work on me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is were it&#39;s at. Beautiful.</p>

<p>Objectivity...the regular people of this sub should try their hardest to obtain objectivity. It is a valuable skill that places ones perspective outside of the emotional attachments that creates bias and corrupts logical and critical thought. </p>

<p>Ego...is the corruption of self identity. The war between the needs and the wants. The ego is full of wants disguised as a need in your life. It is the consumerism, the materialism, the greed. It is that self conscience feeling you don&#39;t live up other peoples expectations that were defined by the the most superficial and false humans on the planet. Defined by the &quot;stars&quot;, the celebrities that they push the masses into worshiping. Ego is the labels and  the brands of everything you own. </p>

<p>Kill the ego and you will kill yet another aspect of thought that emotionally controls you. </p>

<p>I meditate almost everyday. I was introduced to it in high school by my science teacher. We did a simple experiment that anybody can do that will place you in a solid &quot;Here and Now&quot; state of mind, the foundation of meditation....1st, get away from TV or computer. No visual distractions. 2nd, get comfortable in a nice chair, clear your mind of thought and just LISTEN. You can close your eyes or leave them open. If a thought enters your mind let it pass keep listening. Try to be aware of all the different sounds that are making themselves known, that you are becoming more aware of. You will start to feel how it is to be AWARE. Try your hardest to listen for 15 minutes and the awareness will be with you for hours. Do it on a regular basis and you will become an aware person. </p>

<p>Edit: Having access to natural sounds by going outside or near an open window is best.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You took many words right out of my mouth. Thank you for taking the time to pen this, and it&#39;s excellent. </p>

<p>I feel very called to plant my feet firmly in the shit and figure out what to do next, be it local or global. I only want to add to your thoughts that our creativity is what is both being destroyed and what will save us – or at least contribute to that salvation. Imagining what&#39;s next and then imagining and implementing the means are rising in importance, now that so many have seen through much of the bullshit of our constructed and prescripted reality. We become very absorbed in the history and revelations, because there is so much to learn, and it&#39;s fascinating to watch a train wreck that takes centuries, but because the veil is global now the people reading this are at an incredible milestone in the Earth&#39;s history, and the Creative Principle is what got us here, what has been supremely misdirected and drugged – chemically, academically and culturally.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sex has everything to do with life, with the brainwashing process, with natural function of mind, it&#39;s a prevention to neurosis, it&#39;s fulfillment of our biological purpose, ancient temples of knowledge are covered in symbolism of sex and gender, kundalini, Tantra, etc. </p>

<p>Reaching balance with being a sexual mammal and a self conscious intellectual being is necessary to be in accordance with nature. Any schism in this, is a schism in our being. </p>

<p>And yeah we have to eat, lol:) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can only speak for myself. I&#39;ve explored the dark side to its end, the forbidden aspects of ourselves, demons and arch demons, and came to realize the dark is limited, it never wins out. </p>

<p>I literally feel like there was a spiritual war over my soul, and the good side won out, I&#39;m increasingly attributing that to shroom trips. But the dark side has no power, it&#39;s weak, even the inner darkness is built on illusion. There never really is complete darkness, just a lack of light, and even a single proton hurling through space is an illumination unto itself.  </p>
