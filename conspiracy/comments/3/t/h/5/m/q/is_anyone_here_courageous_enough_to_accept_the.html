<p>It&#39;s been the single greatest source of brainwashing in modern history. Ever wondered why Judaism, Christianity, and Islam are so closely tied into each other? That wasn&#39;t by mistake.</p>

<p>Atheism can be used in a similar way, but this analogy is just slightly misguided unless you apply it to more than just atheism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not just that, but the similarity in <em>belief</em>. As I&#39;ve stated before in this thread, you can present aaaaall the evidence out there to a sheep that 9/11 was a false flag, and at the end of it all he would still go &quot;I don&#39;t believe this&quot;. Even when presented undeniable proof he would go &#39;nope&#39;. </p>

<p>I think &quot;belief&quot; is actually something very complicated that would take forever to really get a grasp on. I don&#39;t understand what makes someone belief or disbelief in something at all. I&#39;m talking about the very fabrics of belief.</p>

<p>No, atheism is <strong>NOT</strong> just not believing in anything.</p>

<p>Atheists <strong>believe</strong> there is no higher order or power. This is a belief in and of itself. </p>

<p>This is a matter of semantics, because the deity of atheists is that there is no deity. Most atheists are fanatical about this, refusing to change unless they do some DMT or something similar that basically forces the realization that life is so much more than what meets the eye. </p>

<p>Agnostics don&#39;t have a particular belief one way or another, <strong>atheists believe that there is nothing greater</strong>. This is an important distinction. </p>

<p>Or if they see solid evidence of a deity. Atheists do not believe that there is no purpose, or supernatural superior being/deity, it is simply that they have not been presented with any evidence for such an entity/entities. </p>

<p>Belief doesn&#39;t come into it, at least not for me. If evidence is ever revealed that there is a god/deity or higher supernatural power, then I won&#39;t believe in it, because with evidence, one won&#39;t have to believe in it, in the same way that I don&#39;t believe in friction or gravity, I just know they exist, unambiguously, because my particles are not flying around at the speed of light, and I can literally feel friction by touching things. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Again, this statement ought to be re-written to say that atheists have not been provided with any evidence that shows god (or a higher power) exists. </p>

<p>Hence the whole DMT thing.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Depends on who you ask.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Semantics, and this is my point.</p>

<p>Atheists like to believe they are some kind of neutral unbiased people, and for many that may be the case. For many others, it&#39;s a form of fanatical nihilism. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Again, this statement ought to be re-written to say that atheists have not been provided with any evidence that shows god (or a higher power) exists.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Evidence&quot; varies depending on who is doing the evaluating.</p>

<p>On a quantum level observation changes reality, and the effect often precedes the cause (some elementary statements I know, but applicable). </p>

<p>Nassim Haramein&#39;s work in particular is very relevant to my point. We are all inherently part of the same universal field. </p>

<p>religion:
1 the belief in and worship of a superhuman controlling power, especially a personal God or gods.
▸ a particular system of faith and worship.</p>

<h2>2 a pursuit or interest followed with great devotion.</h2>

<p>Definition 2 doesn&#39;t even apply. Atheists (unfortunately) don&#39;t commune together to intellectually pursue and validate each other. There is no point.</p>

<p>The atheist says no persuasive argument for the existence of God has ever been advanced or adduced without convincing rebuttal. No argument in favor stands (or has been found to stand: the test of argument and evidence. We cannot say that we know that there could be no such entity.</p>

People trust and believe in science because it holds subjective truths for them. They keep trusting in science even if it&#39;s ever-changing and ever self-updating. So you could make the argument that people favor science over religion continously believe in a system that never stays stable. Their belief in the system stays constant. You can write all you want about the supposedly beauty of that and how people like that keep an open mind about the ever changing search for truth but the objective description of the situation stands.
Mind you that I am not disregarding science at all. Science is a tool of understanding like you said. It&#39;s only when people choose to elevate science above religion in the hunt for understanding of our reality that it becomes a problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your understanding of science is very incorrect. Science defines what can be reproduced as a known cause and consequence of events. Trials and studies are performed on many sides of the earth by many different people and the se results can be reached. </p>

<p>The Truth is YOU lack the understanding that through scientific measurment the world has 0 proof of supernatural events. Nothing says coverup more then a collective effort to manufacture a story. Religion is the largest coverup in history. </p>

<p>God may be real, it aint abraham, molech, jesus, or baal anything created by the mind of man is not supernatural it is &quot;natural&quot;. Thus our god theory is of our own creation and that it itself is an example of <strong>self proclaimed divinity</strong> and I cannot ride on that boat of lies. </p>

<p>This paragraph doesn&#39;t present the argument you think it does and, in fact, demonstrates the exact principle of &quot;sheep&quot; that you started this topic to discuss. The first monotheistic religion was Egyptian Atenism, pre-dating the supposed existence of Moses by several hundred years. How about Noah? Virtually the entire Flood account is copy-pasted from the blatantly polytheistic Epic of Gilgamesh. But those are lies spread by the devil to lead you astray, aren&#39;t they?</p>

Which ofcoarse is NOT shown in any video about the  argument of existence for God.

    <div class="md"><p>This is just psychological behavior in response to opposing ideas, when someone shits on your belief it kinda pisses you off, doesn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>It&#39;s something everyone does from time to time, some more than others. You&#39;re reading into it too much, and it looks like you may be a victim of it yourself in a roundabout way.</p>

<p>Since belief is an opinion, it should be presented as such. For instance, I believe our consciousness (or what is perceived to be) is recycled or transferred through some yet-unknown mechanism, similar to how everything in existence is broken down and reused. While it&#39;s based on factual observations, it&#39;s merely a belief I hold which can&#39;t be proven or dis-proven yet, and don&#39;t expect others to share the same idea.</p>

<p>I think the difference here is when presented with real, observable evidence with repeatable science, the sheep hides and refuses to absorb any knowledge or truth given beyond that point.</p>

<p>I have a feeling that if atheists saw irrefutable proof of a sentient creator, such as the creators actual appearance and manipulation of reality with just their being, they might change their minds.</p>

<p>Edit: Or if you want to say that there needs to be a consciousness for a &quot;god&quot; situation to be happening, then what is/has &quot;consciousness&quot;? Maybe you go all native and say that everything has a consciousness. So the consciousness of earth might be god class, and the sun be a god in a class above, and the galaxy a god in a class above that, and a cluster above that, universe... -fades out- You get the idea. So if you don&#39;t want to call all of these one class... i dunno... angel class, demon class, demigod class, spirit class... lol... or whatever you like. Celestial, Astral, Divine, Minstrel, Dragon, Sylvari, Charr, Gryffondor.... as long as you&#39;re talking about a specific thing.</p>

<p>Because fighting a lifetime of indoctrination telling you what to believe, only to face the <em>cold, hard reality</em> that there is <em>nothing</em> but nonexistence waiting for you when you die is a lot of work for <em>absolutely no</em> reward whatsoever, except an ugly, depressing truth.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t say I blame religious people. I <em>wish</em> I could go back to believing in something, anything other than the inevitable. It keeps me up at night, sometimes, and it&#39;s why I&#39;ve decided it&#39;s best if I leave people their religious bubbles--I don&#39;t want to inflict on them the same thing I feel, knowing life has <em>absolutely no meaning whatsoever</em> except that which you give it  yourself, and that once you die there is nothing waiting on you and you cease to be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Heya! I&#39;m about to get weird on you. First off, non-existence isn&#39;t a thing. But for this conversation you have to accept that your understanding of time doesn&#39;t mean much if anything past the 4th dimension and that there is a multiverse. If you&#39;ll humor that, let&#39;s continue.</p>

<p>So let&#39;s talk about non-existence and why it can&#39;t exist. Existence is the difference between &quot;thing&quot; and &quot;no-thing&quot;, with existence being the &quot;force&quot; that animates things. Well... imagine there are no things. If there are truly no things, not even empty space, then you&#39;d have no no-thing either. With a thing, there&#39;s nothing to make the comparison (thing is missing) and so no nothing. So you have no thing, no nothing, but this is the multiverse. That means there are still things &quot;out there&quot;. To truly have an instance of non-existence, those things &quot;out there&quot; would have to not only not exist, but never existed. This nonexistence literally can&#39;t happen because we&#39;re having this conversation. It&#39;s not a thing, and nothing is a whole different concept. To even give it a title means that there&#39;s a thought involved, and so it&#39;s not non-existence. Non-existence, as a term, is a bandaid to discuss a concept you can&#39;t actually name or technically talk about. Because what are you talking about? Etc. etc.</p>

<p>Now let&#39;s go even more quantum. Just humor me further on this. Let&#39;s say that in the 10th Dimension, you have all waves of probability that could ever be for every thing, situation, moment, event, etc. etc. How does one collapse a wave function in this case? Observation. So to observe things on the 10th dimension... yooooou&#39;d pretty much need to nee to be all seeing and have a conscious capable of comprehending what&#39;s going on. At the level of seeing everything forever, you pretty much have to decide (say) what you want to observe. And so on.</p>

<p>So even if that is a logical understanding of the Divine, the next question is: is it taking the information of what&#39;s happening in (passive observation) or is it more or less projecting its will down through the dimensions (active observation) or just yes? Probably just yes.</p>

<p>And then you can take that further and it&#39;s not a god-&quot;proof&quot; but more of a soul-&quot;proof&quot;. Using &quot;proof&quot; as a &quot;catch all/you know what I mean&quot;. But that&#39;s a whole other conversation involving planes of existence that only theoretically exist, maybe. :D</p>

<p>No, that&#39;s fine, I have a basic grasp of multi-verse theory--then again, any proper geek does. Problem is, I believe that while yeah, there are other universes out there, we&#39;re either all cut off, or cut off in such a way that passage between them is <del>impossible</del> exceedingly difficult, for matter or energy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(your entire second paragraph)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ll offer a counter to this, using purely physical and biological principles. What is a soul? What is intellect? Near as we can tell, it&#39;s electro-chemical impulses jumping between neurons, flipping biological bits in the brain to store data. Your brain is a living computer, in essence.</p>

<p>But let&#39;s dumb it down further, eliminate some biology. Imagine a light bulb. Power goes to the bulb, runs through the filament in a vacuum, and produces light and heat. Shatter the bulb. What happens to the electricity running through the filament in those last few seconds? Where does it go? What happens to the electricity flowing through your processor and ram if you suddenly pull the plug? Energy can neither be created nor destroyed, but it can change state. It bleeds off as light and heat, escaping as cosmic background radiation. Entropy. And once it&#39;s gone from those various parts, it has no access to your data storage or emotional centers. So, what makes you <em>you</em> rots, while the power fueling your brain bleeds off into space, bouncing around and mixing with the rest of the heat, completely non-sentient.</p>

<p>I like your idea better and I&#39;ve had the thought before. It is pretty much the one possibility that I&#39;m wrong and gives me any hope whatsoever. But hope, as I&#39;ve come to learn time and again, is a fairy tale we tell ourselves to convince us things really aren&#39;t as bad as they are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>but then i almost literally have to ask about where that energy is coming from in your light bulb analogy. What is that special... bioelectromagnetic... &quot;ummph&quot; that animates a body? You can&#39;t just shock a corpse and expect it to animate. You can make a heart run but not a whole body. But even then, forget our concept of living... the energy that makes everything move in the cosmos. That the stars throw about and the black holes suck up.</p>

<p>That energy. That &quot;force&quot;. Existence. Source. </p>

<p>Therein does the doubt lie. You could argue &quot;biological processes just happen, it&#39;s not magic,&quot; but.. I&#39;m not 100% on the science there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Labeling a &quot;trust in evidence&quot; as a &quot;belief&quot; is a BS move from the religious upon the atheist. Let us ignore the &quot;cleric&quot; smear and posit that most atheists do believe scientists, without question. The religious cleric bases their knowledge on a static, iron-age text, whereas the &quot;science cleric&quot; bases their knowledge on a growing, evolving picture of reality. The &quot;faith&quot; of the atheist in this analogy comes from a trust in the systematic exploration of the real, whereas religious faith comes from belief in an invisible friend and his apologists. Equating the two is insincere.</p>
