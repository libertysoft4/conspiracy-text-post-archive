        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Up until now I had the <em>tendency</em> of believing every alternative source presented to me. As long as it went against the official story, as long as it fitted my anti-government agenda, it was at the very least partially credible to me. This kept my guards down on picking out those little details that are actually false. Yesterday my &#39;partially credible&#39; beliefs were cemented, these alternate sources are almost always only partially correct.
So what made me realize this?</p>

<p>Yesterday a thread was posted with this video:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhW0o2ym8h8&amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhW0o2ym8h8&amp;feature=youtu.be</a></p>

<p>This video is discussing their own article which can be read on this page:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.corbettreport.com/the-paris-terror-attacks-an-open-source-investigation/">https://www.corbettreport.com/the-paris-terror-attacks-an-open-source-investigation/</a></p>

<p>The article lists the alleged creators of ISIS.
The thing that stood out for me here is the claim that Turkey also created and is helping ISIS. Having done more personal research on the Turkish side of the story, I recognized easily that this article tries to paint Turkey in a certain false light.</p>

<p>Open the article link above and click on the &#39;Turkey&#39; hyperlink. What is the general idea you get after reading the entire article? You start to form a view that those Kurds the article is talking about are peaceful freedom fighters who are merely doing their best to fight against ISIS.
The YPG (the Kurds fighting against ISIS that are being attacked by Turkey) are armed forces alligned to the PYD (a Syrian Kurdish political party) which is in turn alligned to the PKK.
The article never mentions the fact that PKK is a well-recognized terrorist organization notorious in Turkey for their methods of bombing public areas, slaughtering entire families and murdering Turkish civilians and armed forces since the 1970&#39;s, all done in the name of creating their own Kurdish state.
At one point it even writes <em>Kurdish “terrorists”</em>, writing terrorists in quotes. The article also cleverly addresses the PKK as &quot;The Kurdish Workers’ Party&quot; (actually translated full name)  but doesn&#39;t make mention of the fact that they are a terrorist organization.
The intentions of YPG fighting against ISIS is to gain control over the region of the Syrian-Turkish border to shatter Syria in pieces and form a Kurdish state where once North Syria would be.
The Turkish president Erdogan is aware of the geopolitical strategies the YPG Kurds have, disguised under the idea that they are fighting off ISIS. He is merely thwarting their plans. Erdogan and Turkey are <strong>not</strong> supporting ISIS.</p>

<p>This gave me a <strong>reality check</strong>. I am not gonna blindly believe <em>any</em> proof or explanation or alternative source just because I personally side with that side of the story. Not even claims of CIA did this or Mossad this that should be fully believed unless you do a full research on this. 
I realized that most conspiracy theories, articles and documentaries are made up of part truth, part speculation and part false information.</p>

<p>However, one thing I want to absolutely make clear here is that this does <strong>not</strong> mean that I will believe more in official stories. The point here is that even <em>our perceived truth</em> is partially corrupted. And this is dangerous. I personally realized that I should hold out my judgement before having done extensive research examining both sides of every story. We should especially do research by reading up on sources of countries other than our own.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I understand what you mean. But the thing I wanted to make clear here is that those &quot;details that don&#39;t matter&quot; actually <em>do</em> matter.</p>

<p>An on point example of this is that these claims that Turkey supposedly created or supports ISIS could be used in a future propaganda campaign against Turkey. Let&#39;s say in the future the Western powers decide to start making Turkey look bad in the media. People who have previously read that &quot;Turkey created ISIS&quot; will be more easily swayed in believing that Turkey is a bad country, since they already have a notion of Turkey being involved in anti-human activity. 
So in your hunt for truth, <em>they</em> managed to plant a lie in your head amongst the truths that you also read.</p>

Yes you&#39;re right to a point, but I see a bigger picture of what they are doing to humanity and a time like this I treat everyone from across the globe the same. They want to divide us on manufactured lines when the real fight is against the 99% of us vs the 1% at the top. I try to remind other people of that as well, lest we forget that we are all being oppressed by the same folk!</p>

Are any of us going to follow up on the convoluted path and is his conclusion logical? There is NO conclusion about &quot;all conspiracies&quot; possible. By their nature a conspiracy is partially or completely hidden. It is useful to even make up a conspiracy to see how it matches observed reality. Example: just the goals (whether true or not) of the &quot;Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot; seem to be happening in reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My sources are various Turkish channels. State-owned and independant. I realize that this may make you feel like I am standing with my own country for the sake of doing that, or that I am a sheep who believes everything my television tells me but I want to assure you with my own personal promise that I am in no way nationalistic for the sake of being nationalistic. In fact I didn&#39;t even follow Turkish politics until the last recent years. I am a sider of truth. I side with the people who preach truth and honesty. And everything I have seen from Erdogan and his party made me see that they are legit.
I was not born in Turkey and I do not live there, I am watching Turkish channels through satellite.</p>

<p>Do you know want to know what made me watch Turkish channels after ignoring Turkish politics and news for my entire life? I was made of aware of certain channels that have programs where discussions of global and national politics were done in a such a way that they are actually discussing things conspiratory in nature on national television. These few programs that I watch that can be counted on 1 hand make no effort in hiding the fact that conspiracy theories are real. These people have openly stated that it&#39;s simply not possible that the official story of 9/11 is right. They have reached the exact same conclusions we have. That it was a false flag to start the &#39;war on terror&#39;, fuel hate on islam and invade the Middle East.
These same programs are discussing <em>today</em> that the Paris attacks were carried out for the same purpose. They are also laying out minor issues about the hypocrisy of the Western world with the French flags being set up everywhere and the &#39;minute of silence&#39; that are happening, which weren&#39;t done for other tragedies in non-western countries. This happens on national television. In what other country can you find news and politics discussion that doesn&#39;t leave out the fact that conspiracies play a huge part of our daily life?
Not many.</p>

<p>I am in no way trying to convince you of anything I say. That is not my intention. I am stating where I stand and how I got here.</p>

<p>That is smart but you have to take in all sources. When you want to control the mind you have to confuse it. Main Stream Media is awesome at doing this with their reporting and commercial breaks. Its breaks the mind. Research &quot;operation mockingbird&quot;. </p>

<p>You also need to remember that &quot;they&quot; will send in moles to just to post information to get you off the scent of discovering the truth. One truth I know is that the government and media only want you to know one truth. They are right and we are wrong! </p>
