    <div class="md"><p>ISIS is a CIA/Mossad/Saudi creation meant to destabilize the middle east, and rationalize western intervention in Syria/Iraq, as well as justify more police state style measures in the US and Europe.</p>

<p>The end goal is total Israeli hegemony in the middle east, an Iran under control of central banks, and more control measures implemented on the general population in the west.</p>

<p>ISIS is the new bogeyman meant to get western populations to give up freedoms. </p>

<p>Mossad who operates ISIS actually wanted an attack to go off on the anniversary of 9/11, but their jewish operative who was organizing the bombing was caught by the FBI right before it was to have occurred:</p>

<p>The recent attacks in paris were real, but the perpetrators were not ISIS, but french/western agents who killed real people and blamed it on ISIS, more information here (this website is fantastic for general information by the way):</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are living in a manufactured reality. After ww2 the Nazi scientists moved to America (operation paperclip) where under CIA they architected the biggest propaganda machine known to man. In fact all new advancements in technology, TV, radio, internet were used to this end. We did not really go to moon, they knew they just had to show us grainy video and then most of us will believe. Then after convincing us the world is round and we are just mere coincidences, we would indulge in immoral ways without guilt. Look around you, we treat each other just like a bag of meat and are willing to trample your neighbour for some temporary monetary gain. We are being encouraged to feed the flesh, and kill the spirit. Will the spirit fight back? That is left to be known.</p>

<p>9/11 was another of the events they orchestrated so they can kick of PNAC (Project for new American century) where they want to expand out of the north american continent and establish their empire. What we see now is them clearing out parts of middle East that they can directly control. They want to destroy multiculturalism and alternative ways of life to establish a one/new world order. Do you want to be part of that agenda? If yes, then you become one of their shills that manipulate online forums and people via media, you are also rewarded handsomely with money. If no, you speak out on forums and to people in real life, but you don&#39;t have any reward and risk being ostracised in society, because humanity is quite like a herd of sheep, they like to follow the masses as it brings them a sense of security. The Nazi (or social) scientists know this very well, they also know which string to pull and when. For example fear is a powerful tool in their book. What we see via the war on terror is them instilling fear on the people to install a full fledged surveillance and police state. That will dawn in the new world order. We the masses can still stop them if we were aware of what I just told you, but most people are just like zombies - their minds are fast asleep.</p>

<p>This was already accomplished by the fake moon landings though.</p>

<p>Of course religion is their power base because the majority of people in the world are still monotheistic, and are easily manipulated by politicians appealing to these people. Look no further than the republicans.</p>

<p>Science is becoming a new religion in a way, but aliens are almost certainly real given the vastness of the universe, it&#39;s unlikely to be disinfo...</p>

<p>Most religious people are monotheistic. And monotheism pretty much does actually.</p>

<p>And another thing to note, if religion was used as a tool to control people, how do you explain the anti-religion movements throughout the last century and even this very day?</p>

<p>Are you referring to systems such as communism that basically banned religion? It&#39;s just swapping out one control system for another..</p>

<p>No, your problem is basing your belief system off of a system that makes the entire story of existence/reality an earth centric one. Aliens create a problem for that belief structure. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Remember I said &quot;religion doesn&#39;t outrule the possibility of <strong>aliens</strong> or inter-dimensional beings.&quot;</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t just mention the existence of djinns, but also the possiblity that aliens exist. In the Quran it says:</p>

<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p><em>(Quran 65.12) Allah is the one who created seven heavens and from Earth like them (of corresponding type); [Allah&#39;s] command descends among them (heavens and earths) so that you may know that Allah is capable of anything and that Allah knows everything.</em></p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p><em>(Quran 42.29) And from His signs He created the heavens and the Earth; and the land animals that He scattered in BOTH of them (heavens and Earth); And He is capable of gathering them (in one place) if He wishes.</em></p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<p>Read and also watch the video linked below for a further explanation on these verses:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.speed-light.info/islam_life_other_planets.htm">http://www.speed-light.info/islam_life_other_planets.htm</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7yilbA0Mw4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7yilbA0Mw4</a> </p>

<p>You can google &quot;Islam aliens&quot; yourself if you want to read further into this.
And besides all that, we are all thinking about a future possibility. This is all assumptions about <em>if</em> aliens exist. And now that you have seen that Islam <em>does</em> indeed not rule out the possibility of other life-forms living in other planets, hopefully you realize and accept that you have not done enough research into the religious view on aliens. Islam does not make the entire story of existence an earth-centric one.</p>

<p>Simply because islam leaves the possibility of aliens open (according to your interpretation) does not mean it isn&#39;t earth centric.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well that&#39;s a good start at least :)</p>

<p>I believe Islam may not only just leaves the &quot;possibility open&quot; for aliens, but might even cleary state for a fact that they exist. As we see from this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(Quran 42.29) And from His signs He created the heavens and the Earth; and the land animals that <strong>He scattered in BOTH of them</strong> (heavens and Earth); And He is <strong>capable of gathering them (in one place)</strong> if He wishes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now I am in no way a scholar and I could be wrong, but this can be interpreted as that if Allah wishes, he will &#39;gather&#39; the land animals together. 
It&#39;s interesting to note that they are being refered to as &#39;land animals&#39;. This may mean that aliens don&#39;t have to be the intelligent or human-like creatures we see and read about in science-fiction.
Even a single living cell, a form of insect, or a larger animal that is living on some other planet would be considered alien.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s a stretch. The definition of alien would be a contradiction if that were the case.</p>

<li>You don&#39;t understand what intelligence is, there is no such thing as a simple creature, every living system is tied to every other living system and intelligence arises from that.

    <div class="md"><p>No, we study theories. These theories are still just theories accepted as truth until someone proved them wrong. So you have to have a inquisitive and open mind, or else even if a theory may not be wholly correct, we would never know. Such is the scientific method. So please don&#39;t take people who consider theories as facts, to know anything what they are talking about.</p>

Look up jeranism on YouTube, he does a good job walking you through a new, open minded inquiry into flat earth.
