    <div class="md"><p>Yeah the problem is that the truly dedicated trolls (and dare I say shills) will continue doing what they do regardless.  We&#39;ve had people message the modmail after they&#39;ve been banned telling us they&#39;d be back or that they have 50 accounts just waiting in the wings and, while I&#39;m sure some of them are just trolling, I expect that some of them aren&#39;t.</p>

<p>What I have seen time and time again is unsourced tall-tale sob stories like the one you&#39;re spinning.</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve been shadowbanned for your behavior in worldnews before and you keep coming back and starting shit with people, causing the mods a headache, then you will rightfully be shadowbanned again for ban evasion. It&#39;s not that complicated.</p>

<p>why would you want to make a new poster wait a month to &quot;learn what is acceptable&quot; - before they speak from the heart, this proposal you are making is is a system that dulls new truth. questioning the establishment is always about asking new questions. the impulse to share what is on one&#39;s mind should not be dampened until that person knows what &quot;acceptable&quot; questions are. there should be no training period where a mindset can be normalized to those who are already asking questions - to express ones original thoughts and questions.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>maybe I don&#39;t understand exactly what you are doing/why. </p>

<p>I am not in favor of real trolls or racist. </p>

<p>but my experience has been a lot of people calling me a troll/shill because I sometimes post about flat earth, and I think it&#39;s super lame that people think they can decide what is ok to talk about and what is not. I don&#39;t try to shut down anybody talking about aliens - and i think its all  bs. but I don&#39;t feel angry about it, or want to shut them down.  I believe  - we don&#39;t all have to think the same things. </p>

<p>so I think people take advantage of the idea of identifying shills and just label people they don&#39;t agree with that. and I&#39;m sick of it. that&#39;s specifically why this convo makes me so annoyed. </p>

<p>but also -- I really do think we should greet newcomers openly - because with each new sketchy event in news there&#39;s an influx of cospiracy curious -- and i would want them to feel welcome not like they had immediate restrictions. I really think there is so much strength in the possibility that numbers can grow rt now -- Paris attacks for example gt new round of people thinking -- is the news not so honest - andI think we should encourage that like hell. </p>

<p>i guess I&#39;m no afraid of shills - i feel their own weak arguments will be their undoing, and keeping gates open for new conversation should be our priority, </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you&#39;re doing right now clearly isn&#39;t working for our community.  Why is this not being discussed as the most important challenge facing us?  Why aren&#39;t members and moderators alike working together to fix some very easily addressed problems?  If there were a vote for mods for exactly this, based solely on performance - past and present, for permitting and sometimes promoting long standing members, who were highly beneficial contributors of our communitu to reach their breaking points and either leave all together, or see themselves wrongfully banned. And I hate to say it, but it would purely be a vote of <strong>no confidence</strong>.  I can&#39;t recall knowing if I&#39;ve even witnessed you or any other mod (FT excluded) so much as acknowledge the problems that are now growing in size and frequency.   And if not addressed, will likely ruin the board.  There&#39;s an old saying: what you permit, you promote.  And what we see is you promoting these attack shills. Lack hunters with only one purpose. They refuse debate. They refuse reason.  And this is what&#39;s being promoted here?  [ed. Clarity]</p>

<p>Are you saying because of the administrative overhead of manually approving certain submitters that don&#39;t meet very fair criteria, you would rather we continue with the same inaction seen today?  The key issues that plague us could almost entirely be handled by a few common sense changes.  Instead of continuing down this same path, month after month, allowing the same contrarian disruptors to not only continue unabated, but to further grow in size.</p>

<p>This comment on our current state of affairs is NOT an insult or attack.  This is an attempt to spark further discussion and ultimately action on this matter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe you have me confused with someone else. And yes, I&#39;m breaking character.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a semi regular here. As I said, I&#39;m playing devil&#39;s advocate. I&#39;m not sure why you think me referring to your old screen name or to &quot;conspiratard&quot; users who have a history of using alts (unhinged ursines, for example) is any sort of telling, other than the fact that I&#39;ve been around a bit longer than my screen name would suggest. Which is something I&#39;ve kinda hung a lantern on. </p>

<p>Bottom line: I don&#39;t like censorship. I don&#39;t see how increasing censorship for the sake of convenience is reasonable, especially when such an increase won&#39;t result in anything constructive. If people are gonna troll or shill or disrupt or go on rants praising AE911 before devolving into calling everyone shills and crying about being stalked and getting banned (again) with a new screen name on a monthly basis, they&#39;re going to do it regardless of how many usernames they go through and how often those usernames get banned and how long the waiting period is. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not going to fix anything. </p>

<p>All its going to do is make it so people who genuinely want to be part of the discussion and should be part of the discussion can&#39;t be. How many times have you seen a new user being called a shill because they&#39;re actually ignorant of the truth (and looking for it)? How many times have you seen someone dismiss another person&#39;s comment or question or even outright insult them because their account is only 3 months old? </p>

<p>This place is intimidating enough for new users, shut them out more than they are already ostracized now and this place will run stagnant.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a deterrent. I think that only a small fraction of those people you described will have the patience or drive to wait a month or even two weeks to go through with their hysterics and/or bullying behavior again.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Not that often. Then again, I don&#39;t go out of my way to look for that kind of stuff like some do. Getting this sub banned/quarantined is the White Whale for a <em>lot</em> of redditors for myriad reasons, and as a result they comb through this sub for anything and everything that they can possibly highlight to deride and whine about. Many of them even abuse reddit&#39;s anonymous username system and make new accounts to deceptively manufacture things to whine about.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s just a month. You&#39;re trying to make a tempest in a teapot out of this. Reddit isn&#39;t fringe or obscure any more, it&#39;s one of the most visited sites in the English language WWW. Most people already have an account. </p>

<p>The net benefit to the quality of the sub achieved by deterring the ban-evading jerks will greatly outweigh the loss of a handful of legit users who want to participate with their new account. And regardless, those who think they&#39;ve got something important to say can simply send a modmail and ask that their comment/post be un-removed.</p>

<p>The vast majority of new users I see posting here are malicious and contrarian. It&#39;s almost certain that they are butthurt ban-evaders who faithfully believe the SRD/#modtalk-fueled smear campaign that this subreddit is openly racist/bigoted.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...I like to get a new account every now and then to help maintain my anonymity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a moot point. Reddit is anonymous by design. I&#39;ve been here for 7 years with two accounts (I would still use my original if it wasn&#39;t shadowbanned because a fallacious report was believed) and I&#39;m still completely anonymous. Just don&#39;t post your PI and you won&#39;t have to keep reinventing yourself here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Education &amp; open minds are the best ideas of you ask me. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed in principle, but disinformation and hostility toward open mindedness from the ban-evading new accounts works directly against that principle. It&#39;s made this subreddit a hostile and annoying environment for most of the regular users. Driving them away by allowing throw-away trolls blurting out &quot;teh jooos dun it!&quot; and ban-evaders attacking every idea that they subjectively disagree with is only making this subreddit that much less respectable and enjoyable.</p>

<p>That&#39;s on you.</p>

<p>The Feds already have a profile for you (and everyone online), no need to pretend like you&#39;re successfully hiding from them by creating new accounts on reddit every time you get nervous that you revealed too much PI (which you should <em>never</em> do online regardless).</p>

<p>Usually after a post you get a load of downvotes. Meanwhile you can see articles like &quot;trump has highest SNL ratings ever&quot; get upvoted to the front page. Loads of non conspiracy posts, political shills and general trolls have made this board lesser in quality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know it´s unproductive up to plain sickening to read through a lot of stuff here. I don´t, well, didn´t, post here, but read a lot. </p>

<p>But do you really want to risk missing/letting down someone who comes here to post something really new, something that might be important and urgent,  something that might even bring people to not just talk but act, just because their account isn´t old enough? Someone who´s in a pinch about something and had no involvement or idea of such things before might search the interenet for a forum and come here to try to reach a public, uncensored, in the hope of not exposing themselves to whatever people who might not just not listen to them. A month can be <em>very</em> long. Sure most people could wait a month to contribute without the world stopping to turn, but what if they have something to post that <em>can´t</em> wait a month?</p>

<p>As others say, the kind of people who do detrimental things hardly will have scruples about hoarding accounts, or already have hoarded them, or will make and hoard them, either.
Banning trolls as they troll, is one thing, keeping people from participating here based on nothing more than the date they created their account, another.</p>

<p>People who come here because they have something important to say might rightfully go elsewhere if they can´t say it. Let´s hope there is an elsewhere for them then and that not everywhere won´t let anyone post who hasn´t a minimum 1 month old account.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Easy for professional shills to get around. They just have to churn out accounts on a daily basis and have a 1 month buffer for them to mature. It&#39;s almost no trouble at all for them.</p>

<p>For the growth in popularity of the sub-Reddit it&#39;s highly inconvenient. New users to the forum who may have been unjustly banned from other conspiracy forums for having the &#39;wrong ISP&#39; will come here and find they can&#39;t participate here either. They might have little interest in the rest of Reddit, and forget about joining in here.</p>

<p>The only kind of shills it might deter are non-professional, non government users from political forums who wish to make this sub a recruitment ground. I suppose such a rule would make a dent in their influence.</p>

We are like minded, we know to take everything with a grain of salt, and at the end of the day it&#39;s our choice to believe what we want and dismiss what we deem false. Ours and no one elses. You dont have to call someone a shill or troll because you dont agree, discuss why the earth is round instead of calling flatearthers retards. People come here because they are tired of the hate and attacks from msm sites.
Maybe it&#39;s the government agents (jtrig?) Doing there best to destabilize online communities trying to make a difference.</p>

<p>Reddit is a big place. Like you said, &quot;they&#39;ll find a different sub&quot;, there&#39;s plenty of other places for them to pass the time. Meanwhile <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> will be here when they mature their account for a measly month. </p>

<p>No one is suggesting banning new users, just limiting their contributions entirely until the account of a certain age.

<p>Yes, in subs opened to undermine and ridicule r/conspiracy. They&#39;ll go to r/shittyconspiracy or r/topmindsofreddit, they&#39;ll hear a bunch of negative shit and they&#39;ll probably believe it because we won&#39;t let them post anything and they&#39;re already pissed at us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure I will. but that does not invalidate my insights on day one. censorship is censorship, - free speech is not just for the established, seasoned voices. </p>

<p>why would you want to make a new poster wait a month to &quot;learn what is acceptable&quot; - before they speak from the heart, this proposal you are making is is a system that dulls new truth. questioning the establishment is always about asking new questions. the impulse to share what is on one&#39;s mind should not be dampened until that person knows what &quot;acceptable&quot; questions are. there should be no training period where a mindset can be normalized to those who are already asking questions - to express ones original thoughts and questions.  </p>
