I&#39;m not very experienced with guns so I have a lot of learning to do.  Right now I&#39;m looking into taking the safety class, etc, so any suggestions are welcome!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But now you can identify and arrest the crazies, because they&#39;re the ones with the guns.</p>

<p>wee anecdote; a friend of mine was mugged at gunpoint in a Scottish city. He wandered into the police station to report it and the place goes crazy, police are running out of there with the description of the guy to hunt the streets on foot. Hes hustled into the back of a police car to cruse around looking for this guy. </p>

<p>Didn&#39;t catch the guy that day, but my point is if only criminals have guns, then its easy to spot the criminals; they&#39;ll be the ones with the guns. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But it sounds like your friend wouldn&#39;t have been successfully mugged if he had a firearm and trained himself how to wield it. So in your version of the story your poor friend has to run to the cops to report the mugging because he wasn&#39;t able to protect himself, and in doing so found no justice that day. Sounds like your buddy might have been alright if he had a firearm! I think it&#39;s your right as a human being to protect yourself from intruders of your rights and safety.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is exactly the effect that these events are supposed to inspire. These attacks are meant to instill fear and incite action. The fear causes those who were against gun ownership to fear guns even more and cause those who were for gun ownership to speak up and fight more for ownership rights. </p>

<p>You are meant to be afraid. It doesn&#39;t matter whether or not you trust the government to handle the situation because they are the entity that controls the military. They will enact and enforce any laws that are for our &quot;safety&quot;, but are really only in the interests of the corporate banks. </p>

<p>Fear also causes us to point fingers and place blame. Whether this blame is on a religion, ethnicity or other generalized group of people does not matter either. Please remember to take a breath and ground yourself. Do not allow yourself to be riled up by these fear mongering tactics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Noithing against you getting a gun, but statistically speaking terrorist attacks have a statistically insignificant chance of effecting you.  If you are planning to keep it in your home then the chance of it coming into play in a terrorist attack are essentially zero; even closer to zero than in public and that is <em>really</em> close to zero already.</p>

<p>If you want to carry a gun with you, you must either openly display it (not have it hidden in a pocket or under a coat that passes your waist.  Alternately you can acquire a concealed carry permit however, last I heard they are basically never granted in CA except to law enforcement personnel.  There has been at least one lawsuit on the constitutionality of their not being issued with any frequency recently, so this may have changed.</p>

<p>Realistically and probabilistically terrorism should not come into your decision making much more than should dangerous escaped zoo animals or being suddenly transported to the wild west.  Much more important factors: </p>

<p>Do you live in a dangerous neighborhood?  Even if yes, you&#39;re probably safer outside your home without one than with.  A free gun not registered to a criminal is a nice prize and a gun doesn&#39;t stop a baseball bat to the head from behind.  Further you are several times more likely to be shot in an assault if you are carrying a gun.</p>

<p>Do yu live with children, drug users or idiots?  If the answer to any of these is yes, then a gun should be stored in a combination locked gun box for your safety and for that of others.  This makes it much less likely to be useful for home protection.  You are also several times as likely to have an accident with a gun in or around around the house than to use it in self defense in the house.</p>

<p>Does your job involve an unusually high risk of being attacked (attorney, jeweler, Apu).  If yes, then you have an added incentive to get one, concealed carry permit or no.</p>

<p>It&#39;s your right, but for most people  the risks outweigh the gains and based on the statistical likelihood of various occurrences, terrorist attack should not significantly influence your decision one way or the other.</p>
