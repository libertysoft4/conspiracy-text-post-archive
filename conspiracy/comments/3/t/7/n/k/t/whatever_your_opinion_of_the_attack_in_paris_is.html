<p>It&#39;s curious how many users will find themselves drawn into long debates, defending the 100% legitimacy of reporting on these attacks.</p>

<p>These narrative control efforts are definitely happening regardless of what you think actually happened in Paris.</p>

<p>IMO this points to an organizational effort.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I find interesting is that going to bat with these kinds of nasty/nay sayer posters over months of putting my ideas in comment threads - has actually taught me strength in my convictions and strategy in persistence - rather than led me to back down or change my mind. They have given me a boot camp of dialogue rigor -which led to my fortitude. And I feel strong. Spills over into my conversations in real life too. I can share with more and more people now and I can weather initial negativity and navigate to common ground. When before I was afraid of social response, now I feel much less fear through all this on line practice and learning I can take it come what may. Haha. yay. thanks for the training. </p>

<p>I think maybe a few people were shot. and the mass of casualties were staged, and/ but maybe they were all staged. I&#39;m not sure tho. &amp; I&#39;m not sure how I&#39;ll get sure how real or staged it all was. </p>

<p>But I&#39;m SURE it was organized by US-England-Isreal-world bankers-freakers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Either there are patterns by chance (chance is what governs most of the universe anyway) or patterns that are put there on purpose. Some events are false flags yes but I , in my opinion, could not disagree more about this one. And even if it was, I sure as hell dont want millions of unregistered immigrants into Europe. So for once this makes sense. Oh and people going on about the passport there why , oh why, if you think so critically hasn&#39;t anyone asked what if the terrorists actually just put them there on purpose? Doesnt it make sense that they want to gain more followers? They stop more immigrants coming into Euope and like that they get more pissed off Muslims wanting to join a &quot;cause&quot; and haters joining on the &quot;destroy the west&quot; bandwagon.

<p>You can call people who disagree with you &quot;shills&quot; all day long, but if your theory carries any weight you should be able to handle the burden of proof.</p>

<p>You should consider this process to be a positive thing. Debate is good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I agree with you.</p>

<p>The highest tenents of conspiracy are deception and secrecy.</p>

<p>So you can see why we aren&#39;t easily deterred by the demands that our theories be proven beyond your doubts immediately</p>

<p>Furthermore, once a theory has been thoroughly flushed out and significant evidence (I recognize that for some of the detractors, public admission via the proper channels is the only acceptable evidence)  has been assembled in support of it, it will still face rejection from supposed &quot;unbiased&quot; readers.</p>

<p>The fact is, there is an element present here who will deny everything.</p>

<p>It&#39;s their mantra.</p>

<p>That being said, I&#39;ve not drawn any conclusions about what happened in Paris yet.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>But you see, what we&#39;re supposed to be doing here is assessing the &quot;potential legitimacy&quot; of what the mainstream media and the purveyors of official history tell us about events. That&#39;s all I do anyway. I also assess the &quot;potential legitimacy of a conspiracy theory&quot; too, but more often than not those theories which are not legitimate are fairly easy to spot. Over time, bullshit is weeded out. </p>

<p>The issue the OP brings up is that when this sub is flooded with useless posts and comments after an event like the Paris attacks, it becomes very difficult for substantive discussion to take place when legit posts and discussions are brigaded, buried, and derailed, while terrible posts often wind up on top. You get moronic posts from users you never see here , which generate the usual responses that always mention &quot;you people&quot;. It&#39;s like &quot;Hey,  buddy post something stupid to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and I&#39;ll jump in and show them how stupid they all are&quot;. </p>

<p>Yeah, debate is good, but when you get some guy coming in and saying, &quot;We know who shot JFK, it was solved within hours, LHO did and that&#39;s the end of the story&quot;, it&#39;s a complete waste of time and energy. Why does someone come here at all if they know LHO did it and it was solved within hours? To disrupt discussion. </p>

<p>Ha! Oh, you&#39;re funny. Sad but funny. Your post history shows that you are <em>never</em> sceptical of any mainstream narrative, yet you only ever post to this sub under this account. All you do is deride anyone who doesn&#39;t believe the shit we get every day from the corporate media. You are so obviously here to disrupt discussion and nothing else. You post frequently and are usually always on the side of the mainstream narrative. So why are you here then? And if you tell me you&#39;re here to be entertained, well, you really are sad. </p>

<p>It&#39;s clear that when someone frequently posts to a sub, usually mocking users and never actually contributing in any positive way, that&#39;s disruptive. Troll, shill, useful idiot - it makes no difference to me. All I know is, you are disruptive. </p>
