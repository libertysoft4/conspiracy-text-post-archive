        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I know that in the past, and many documentaries I&#39;ve watched mentioned in this community, pushed the narrative of a world communist conspiracy. So I would like to know where people stand on the question now? I don&#39;t mean what people think of past socialist or communist movements, but what people think about the actual socialist message and in particular the anti-authoritarian kind put forward by anarcho-communists, libertarian socialists, etc.</p>

<p>I think there is ample evidence to show that not only was the &quot;communist conspiracy&quot; a spreading of false consciousness, but it is the global elites who were/are behind it. I look at it both historically and analytically. </p>

<p>Historically, we know that the US imperialist machine spent most of the cold war invading/meddling in countries like Vietnam, Cambodia, Guatemala, Chile, El Salvador, Cuba, and so on under the pretext of &quot;communism&quot;. These wars brought on severe devastation to the local communities, puppets were installed to serve their interests, and mass movements and uprisings were squashed through paramilitary force, propaganda, and so on. Along with these foreign invasions, the elite needed to convince the population at home that they were sending their children to war for a good cause. Thus the Red Scare was pushed heavily on Americans throughout the cold war, which had a lasting effect. This lasting effect is still seen today where some &quot;truth-seekers&quot; still believe there is a world communist conspiracy in spite of the ample evidence of massive propaganda campaigns waged by the media and the controlling elite to misrepresent or bash socialism and its adherents. We also know that the US military industrial complex is at the service of the global elites, so it stands to reason that they did not want the spread of communism (even if those movements were severely flawed) because it was a threat to their hegemonic power. Secondly, when the ideology of the elites were threatened by both the left (socialism) and right (fascism) historically the elites united with the fascists to defeat the socialists. In Italy, the birth of fascism, the Italian fascists beat the communists with the help of the business class. The Italian elites, including Jewish businessmen such as Ettore Ovazza, supported the fascist movement and contributed media propaganda. Likewise, in Germany Hitler was able to secure a populist victory with the aid of wealthy men including Prescott Bush (George Bush&#39;s grandfather). Thus it was clear that when capitalism was in crisis, the elites allied with the fascists to defeat the socialist movements. </p>

<p>Analytically we see why the global elites would want to convince the masses that socialism is evil. Socialism at its core seeks to have the means of production controlled by the workers and not by a small group (the bourgeoisie). It also recognizes that under capitalism the bourgeoisie would get smaller as wealth would concentrate into fewer hands due to competition and higher barriers of entry into markets. A simple, yet effective, analogy of this would be the board game Monopoly where several players compete only to have one dominate through the purchasing of property. Capitalism is actually less fair, because in Monopoly all players start with the same amount of capital, but in the real world those who were already wealthy from the aristocracy, slave trade, and so on had a head start in monopolizing their wealth and power. Peter Joseph <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gn2EU5CLIgM">goes through great length</a> speaking about differential advantage and how market systems naturally lead to this consolidation of wealth and power. Socialism was a direct threat to this ideology of private property and market systems. Socialism recognized the exploitation of the markets and the wage system. Thus, from an analytical point of view it is perfectly clear why the global elite would oppose such an ideology and adopt liberalism instead. Socialism (in particular revolutionary socialism) seeks to mobilize the workers to take power from the ruling class. Liberalism, on the other hand, maintains the ruling class&#39; power while giving us the illusion of democracy, freedom and so on. Liberalism is what the elites have widely adopted and I would include the American version of libertarianism as well, since it is just the modern version of classical liberalism. Often it is this sort of liberalism that gets confused with Marxism and I have seen some in the conspiracy community refer to this as &quot;cultural marxism&quot; which is completely misguided and again spreads false consciousness.</p>

<p>So my question to you guys is, where do you stand on socialism now?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_socialism">libertarian socialism</a>, the kind that Chomsky and many anti-authoritarian socialists are a part of. Quite frankly, the concentration of power is exactly what happens under capitalism. Socialism is to dismantle that. I too am against authoritarian socialists who believe they must seize the state, implement state capitalism to transition toward socialism. </p>

<p>It&#39;s also worth mentioning that &quot;libertarianism&quot; was always a socialist ideology before it was hijacked by business elites. The Koch brothers have their money all over this new false form of &quot;libertarianism&quot;.</p>

<p>State welfarism is not what socialism is. Otto Von Bismarck is considered one of the fathers of the modern welfare state and he was an ardent anti-socialist. State welfarism was used by capitalists to pacify the working class from demanding what is truly ours</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You realize that the &quot;Withering away of the state&quot; is just some fake concept that has never happened in the history of any government in the world.

    <div class="md"><p>The state has not always existed so the notion that it could never go away is absolute nonsense and attempts to suggest that the state is part of human nature when it&#39;s a relatively new concept in the history of man.</p>

<p>Of course I&#39;ll reference Marx and Engels. Marx wrote the most important socialist works, so if someone mistakes socialism for something it is not I would point them to the fundamentals. Do you want me to point you to Proudhon, Bakunin, Kroptkin? They&#39;re anarchist socialists, so we know where they stand with regard to the state. Or should I point you toward modern socialists like Chomsky.</p>

<p>This is one of the problems I spoke about in my original post. Capitalist propaganda has convinced people like you that socialism means &quot;big government&quot; and when I point you to the very words of actual socialists you just brush it off. The propaganda has been so successful that you can&#39;t even have a meaningful discussion about socialism, people just assume the propaganda they were fed is a correct representation of it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyyvzrMzJFg">State socialism is a contradiction</a></p>

<p>EDIT: I just want to add that it serves the ideology of the elite to equate socialism with big government and &quot;big government&quot; of course meaning taxes and labour protection laws, while not meaning laws that entrench corporate power as it does now. Because in the latter sense, the corporate elite love big government but that is usually not what it&#39;s associated with. Big government is usually associated with programs that are aimed to help the working class, while programs that help bankers and corporatists are called &quot;free trade&quot;, &quot;economic liberalism&quot; and so on. In reality socialism at is core is the means of production controlled by the working class, which is something the elite is absolutely against. So long as they have people like you associating socialism with big government, they&#39;re happy.</p>

<p>You know that the Ancient Egyptians had a government right? That was 12000 years ago.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Which ones? Do you consider Das Kapital a &quot;socialist work&quot;? Do you consider The Holy Family a &quot;socialist work&quot;? When I read them, they seemed like critiques of other systems/ideologies already in place. The most that Marx ever said about what a communist country should be was &quot;To each by his need, from each by their ability&quot;. And that&#39;s literally it. He never even says the word &quot;socialism&quot; in any of his writing. It was always &quot;communism&quot; and literally the only book that&#39;s in is the Communist Manifesto (and it&#39;s not even a book, it&#39;s a 37 page pamphlet). Marx was a social critic. He never put forth any ideas about how his ideal society work besides the single motto I already mentioned.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and when I point you to the very words of actual socialists you just brush it off. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. I do brush off the idea that in a socialist country, the government just &quot;withers away&quot;. Regardless of whether or not there was a time when government didn&#39;t exist, the idea that those in power would just kindly give up their power because everything is so great has absolutely no basis in reality. </p>

<p>I agree it&#39;s possible for there to be a society without a government but it would most likely come from a violent revolution and overthrow than from everyone being so happy and getting along so well that the state just....... &quot;withers away&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>LOL. You have not at any point made any coherent argument for socialism. Your entire dumb post is an explanation of why you don&#39;t believe there was ever a &quot;communist conspiracy&quot; and nothing more. There&#39;s no definition of what you believe socialism actually is. There&#39;s no explanation of how it would function and who would be in charge. And there&#39;s no explanation of how we get there from our current government system.</p>

<p>Literally, you said NOTHING about what socialism is, you just made some dumb anti-conspiracy rant and now you&#39;re mad people are &quot;brushing off&quot; your ideas? Lol. Keep your day job bud, you ain&#39;t the next Marx.</p>

<p>TIL only Egyptians existed 12000 years ago. You realize states are a human construct right? It came about due to a necessity to organize the means of production when there was a surplus of production. You realize there were stateless societies before and after the ancient Egyptians right? To say a stateless society is just utopian fantasy ignores actual moments in history when stateless societies have existed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Which ones?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you honestly debating whether Marx was the most influential socialist writer? Yes, Das Kapital was largely a critique of capitalism, however he wrote it to inform and stir up the working class where he saw the revolutionary potential. He wrote The Communist Manifesto for socialists in Britain, Critique of the Gotha Programme for German socialists, The German Ideology, and Economic &amp; Philosophic Manuscripts. These all talk to socialists and when he talks about communism he talks about lower phase (socialism) and higher phase. This is right in the Critique of the Gotha Programme where he not only talks about &quot;each according to his ability&quot; under higher stage communism but under socialism being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_each_according_to_his_contribution">&quot;each according to his contribution&quot;</a>. Marx saw socialism as a transitional stage toward communism (stateless and classless society). Communism is a branch of socialism, they are not two different things. Marx was involved with British, French, and German socialists. All communists are socialists, but not all socialists are communists.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the idea that those in power would just kindly give up their power because everything is so great has absolutely no basis in reality. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who said those in power would kindly give it up? Either power is decentralized among the masses (socialism) and the state just serves an administrative role and eventually become redundant or a revolution occurs as Marx and revolutionary socialists all agreed would be necessary so long as there is class conflict and power imbalance. It&#39;s important to note that state itself is a tool of power, those who control that tool (in today&#39;s society the capitalist elite) would certainly never kindly give it and Marx was well aware of that in his time. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s no definition of what you believe socialism actually is</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right in my original post I explained the very basic tenets of socialism which is &quot;the means of production controlled by the workers&quot;. That is the most basic definition you can get. I didn&#39;t come here to write a treatise on socialism but to get a gist of where others stand presuming they actually know what socialism means. Of course, if someone comes here spouting nonsense like you have then I will refute your ignorance on the topic.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>now you&#39;re mad people are &quot;brushing off&quot; your ideas</p>

<p>People aren&#39;t really brushing off my ideas. It&#39;s just you ranting like a poor brainwashed lunatic</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would argue that the elite uses socialism as a populist tool in order to appeal to the egos of the people and funnel their gullible money into their own pockets. The power of the state will grow further and people become dependent if not addicted to the state. An analogy is the drug dealer, giving away his pills for &quot;free&quot;. Well, we all know that there is no &quot;free&quot; in the world. Everything has its price. </p>

<p>Politicians promise you something like this: &quot;You have a right for free college, universal healthcare, a car, an airplane, an island and a hot wife. And guess what? You only have to work 3 days a month!&quot; Don&#39;t get me wrong, I would really LOVE for all people to have those things. It&#39;s just not possible. Things don&#39;t just emerge out of thin air.<br/>
If you have a right on free education, that translates to: Somebody else has to be forced to educate you for free. If you have a right to a free car, you&#39;re stealing a car. Of course, I can hear you say: &quot;No, wait a minute teachers are payed for by taxes. That&#39;s not stealing.&quot; Of course it is stealing. Socialists promise you a free car and then steal ten times the money from you to gift you one. Socialism cripples autonomy, it retards the natural balance of supply and demand, hinders prosperity, it hates families, individuals and even health. It only resonates with our greed and shortsightedness.</p>

<p>Socialism could work in theory. Maybe all of those systems are perfect. It is just us people who ruin those systems. What we, as imperfect beings need, is to better ourselves as individuals. Maybe we should be social because we want to and not because we&#39;re forced to. Maybe we shouldn&#39;t buy those things that we don&#39;t need. Maybe we shouldn&#39;t envy our neighbors car.</p>

<p>Edit: The word Socialism is such an Orwellian term. If I don&#39;t agree with socialism, I am automatically a an anti socialist. And it&#39;s not even social because it forces people to act like they&#39;re social.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suggest you watch this to get an understanding of what Socialism actually is: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysZC0JOYYWw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysZC0JOYYWw</a></p>

<p>What you have repeated is precisely the propaganda I referred to about socialism and again this is just further evidence how much the elites fear socialism when they actively misinform people, such as yourself, on what socialism actually is. Socialism is NOT about state programs or big government, this is a common misconception. There are socialists who are anti-state, such as myself. Socialism is about workers controlling the means of production and collectively owning what they produce. </p>

<p>To understand socialism you must take yourself outside of the capitalist paradigm. You&#39;re making comments about &quot;free&quot; things, taxes, etc is all operating within a capitalist paradigm. Capitalism and socialism cannot coexist.</p>

<p>Again, I suggest you watch that video because this misunderstanding of what socialism actually is only serves those who seek to misinform the masses about it, because it threatens their power.</p>

<p>I would say I would like to know how you think socialism cripples families, but you are so far off on what you think socialism is that there&#39;s no point. If I accepted ruling elite propaganda on what socialism is, I too would think it cripples everything and is evil. The question is, why are you accepting ruling elite propaganda?? Propaganda that&#39;s spread by Koch funded institutions like Cato. Socialism has been smeared by both factions of the ruling elite parties: the Democrats and Republicans, and I include Sanders who mistakes socialism with welfarist social democracy. David Koch called Obama a hardcore socialist, which is pure red baiting. Ask any socialist if they would consider Obama a socialist and they would laugh at you. The goal of the elite is to continue to smear and associate the word &quot;socialism&quot; with big government and all that is bad in the world so that you don&#39;t think critically about the actual system that benefits the ruling elite, capitalism and its use of the state to enforce its hegemony.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for replying with a detailed post. I have watched the video you posted. I do not agree with you. Of course you could say I am brainwashed by the capitalist elite. But we would not get very far arguing about that because I could simply state that you have been brainwashed by the socialist elite. </p>

<p>&quot;Socialism is about workers controlling the means of production and collectively owning what they produce.&quot;</p>

<p>If this is such good idea, why isn&#39;t this a standard business model? What exactly is the problem when a business owner creates a contract with his workers on a voluntary basis? The business owner has a lot of risks and responsibilities. He can&#39;t just quit his job and work somewhere else like normal worker. Of course you could also have business models where the workers are controlling the means of production. There is no rule in capitalism that forbids you that. Capitalism is in fact no ideology. It&#39;s just what we call people interacting with each other without interference from the state.</p>

<p>&quot;Again, I suggest you watch that video because this misunderstanding of what socialism actually is only serves those who seek to misinform the masses about it, because it threatens their power.&quot;</p>

<p>I have watched the video and I must say I did not learn much new things about socialism. He said that government is just the means of the socialists to transform society by force. But why do you need force to transform society if your model is a better one? Just start businesses that are owned by workers and they should skyrocket to the moon if that&#39;s such a good way of making business. </p>

<p>His ideas on how businesses work are not grounded in reality. Of course there is an evil executive that hates all his workers and wants to bleed them dry like slaves. Look at a small business owner. Is the Deli-Shop owner an evil person, just because he owns a business and makes more money than his worker? No, he&#39;s not. Of course he makes more money. Compared to the worker he takes a HUGE amount of risk. What happens to him when there are no customers? He doesn&#39;t generate any money but he still has to pay his worker. What if there is no customers for a month because there is a competitor across the street? He&#39;ll go bankrupt but his worker can just get another job. There are just so many things that could happen that the regular worker does not care about, especially if he works at a giant corporation. So yes, the business owner might not work as hard manually, but he takes the fall for the whole company and that&#39;s what he&#39;s getting payed for basically. </p>

<p>&quot;I would say I would like to know how you think socialism cripples families, but you are so far off on what you think socialism is that there&#39;s no point.&quot; </p>

<p>Well, how can I answer that if socialism can&#39;t be described? </p>

<p>There is either freedom and very little meddling from state. Then, the system which is most profitable for workers and business owners will assert itself because those are grounded on social, voluntary contracts. If what you call socialism (owners own the means of production?) is such a good idea, then it would automatically assert itself in society. 
Reality is, it wouldn&#39;t work and would have to be enforced by the state.</p>

<p>Just because the Koch brothers are funding it, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s propaganda. If Hitler had said that snow is white, it wouldn&#39;t have made snow automatically black. The Koch&#39;s are not the authority of the free market. </p>

<p>&quot;Ask any socialist if they would consider Obama a socialist and they would laugh at you. The goal of the elite is to continue to smear and associate the word &quot;socialism&quot; with big government and all that is bad in the world so that you don&#39;t think critically about the actual system that benefits the ruling elite, capitalism and its use of the state to enforce its hegemony.&quot;</p>

<p>I know a lot of people who would call themselves socialist. They&#39;re all in favor of big government, Obama and Sanders. We could argue about the goals of the elite and we&#39;d always go back and forth. My opinion stands. The goal of the elite is to smear honey around the mouths of their voters with their form of socialism that you might not agree on. The actual, current system is not a capitalist system. That&#39;s a deception.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>EDIT: Just so you know, there was a part 2 with the video I sent you, so if you felt it didn&#39;t answer most of your questions the 2nd part may do that: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMUuw_K-ky0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMUuw_K-ky0</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>If this is such good idea, why isn&#39;t this a standard business model? What exactly is the problem when a business owner creates a contract with his workers on a voluntary basis?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, this is looking at things within the capitalist paradigm. A worker cooperative self-managed enterprise, although they exist, can barely compete against a capitalist enterprise that exploits its workers in a capitalist world. The ability for a capitalist enterprise to exploit workers (ie: hire cheap labour and extract as much profit from what they produce as possible) gives them an advantage. Much like slavery was a competitive advantage and if it existed today in the same extent it did over a century ago, then enterprises that run slave plantations have a competitive advantage. So to put it shortly, it&#39;s not the standard business model because the current legal regime favours exploitative capitalist businesses.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The business owner has a lot of risks and responsibilities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A slave plantation owner also took risks, it does not justify his exploitation of slave labour. Likewise, the risks a business owner takes does not justify the exploitation of labour.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What exactly is the problem when a business owner creates a contract with his workers on a voluntary basis?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem is that for the large majority of people on this planet, this is not voluntary. They must work to pay their rent, pay for food, pay for transportation to work, pay for a mobile phone, internet, etc in order to work in modern society. For most people they take what they can get and do what they&#39;re told, which is hardly voluntary. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s just what we call people interacting with each other without interference from the state.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I disagree with this definition. Capitalism relies on a state. When a wealthy business man claims he owns a lake used by a local community, who recognizes this ownership? It is the state. Who enforces this notion of private property? It is the state. Capitalism cannot survive without state violence enforcing private property laws (not to be confused with personal property). So next time you see locals protesting the actions of a foreign company, remember that the company does what it does and gets away with it through the sanctity of private property, enforced by state. Furthermore, we see that as capitalism evolves capitalists consolidate and concentrate their wealth. As these entities get bigger they are able to control the state at a much more effective capacity. The Federal Reserve was created jointly by powerful capitalists and the state. It is rational of them to do so since capitalism is about competition and growth and the larger a capitalist enterprise grows the more they will do to protect and grow their wealth. This inevitably means controlling government policy, pushing foreign interventionism to get other governments to bow down to their demands. In the high state of capitalism we live now, we see that we live under economic dictatorship imposed by the World Bank, IMF, and other capitalist alliances used to force state to implement policies that serve their interests.</p>

<p>When capitalism begins to fail large segments of society, society responds with violence. How is that violence squashed? It is squashed by the police who serve the state to protect the private property of capitalists. When people feel alienated by capitalism and fight back, the state responds with violence. Capitalists are heavily dependent on a police state.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But why do you need force to transform society if your model is a better one</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because those who control society now will not relinquish power. Just as the middle class started a revolution against old feudal societies, transformation of society came with the guillotine. Transformation of society would mean ending private property laws which favour the rich over the landless workers. Especially in this era we&#39;re in a new neo-rentier economy where we not only have landlords but owners of intellectual property and it is through these property laws that the rich keep us in debt and servitude. The rich will not allow the transformation of society, so we the people must fight for it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Look at a small business owner. Is the Deli-Shop owner an evil person, just because he owns a business and makes more money than his worker? No, he&#39;s not. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree and most socialists do not look at small business owners as some big evil enemy. Yes, we consider them <em>petty bourgeois</em> but we recognize that these small business owners also get trapped by the system and often exploit themselves just to break even. They must work long hours, pay a large amount to the landlord of the shop, and ultimately they struggle to survive.  If they get innovative with their business, larger ones will appropriate their ideas and put them out of business. This happened with independent-run gas stations that started selling general products like snacks, newspapers, etc. Big companies got wise to this idea, squeezed the independent owners out through rent (since they still owned the property), and put in a gas station clerk working for minimum way in order to take the profit that the independent owner was making. </p>

<p>Furthermore, a company going bankrupt does impact workers in more ways than one. They may now need to move to worker somewhere else which can be very difficult if they have a family. They may not get all wages owed to them if the company filed for bankruptcy. Bankruptcy doesn&#39;t just effect the owner, and if we&#39;re talking about large corporations well Trump has gone bankrupt several times but it was not him but the workers that ultimately suffered. Trump used the bankruptcy laws as a tax avoidance tool. Again, laws designed by capitalists for capitalists.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just because the Koch brothers are funding it, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s propaganda.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They&#39;re funding it precisely because it benefits them. Big corporations push forward NAFTA, TTIP, TPP, TISA, because it benefits them over us. Spreading misinformation about socialism makes complete sense considering socialists want to end their dictatorship.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Obama and Sanders.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t know of a single socialist who considers Obama a socialist. They would be objectively incorrect in calling Obama a socialist. He bailed out the banks while implemented austerity on the working class. That is the antithesis of socialism. A socialist does not save capitalism, he seeks to end it. The only people I&#39;ve seen call Obama a socialists are tea party-ists and unsurprisingly they&#39;re a movement largely funded by the Kochs. So I would say it doesn&#39;t matter what your friends call themselves and Obama, but to say he&#39;s a socialist is just objectively wrong. Unless Obama calls for the overthrow of capitalism and transition to a society where workers own the means of production, he&#39;s not a socialist. If you want to know what socialists (those who are actually consistent with basic socialist principles) think about Obama, read this: <a href="http://www.socialistalternative.org/socialists-2012-elections/obama-democrats/">http://www.socialistalternative.org/socialists-2012-elections/obama-democrats/</a> </p>

<p>You say that the current system is not capitalist, but I argue that this is exactly what happens when you allow the private control of industry. Those with more power will use it to concentrate more into their hands and this inevitably means controlling the state. A video you may find more interesting in critiquing capitalism is from Peter Joseph of the Zeitgeist Movement. Check it out: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIFK0NhMVws">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIFK0NhMVws</a></p>

<p>Keep educating yourself, I don&#39;t claim to have all the answers but when I put what people in the mainstream told me what socialism is alongside what actual socialist organizations were saying it was clear to me there was a massive smear campaign going on. It is no different than when the media calls anyone in the 9/11 truth movement as &quot;conspiracy nut&quot;. It&#39;s just pure smear. It makes sense since it is only a continuation of propaganda against socialism that was pushed heavily throughout the cold war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for your lengthy answer. I really appreciate that you took the time to read my comment and to reply to my arguments. But there seem to be too many fundamental things that we can&#39;t agree on and those things can&#39;t be changed by a discussion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A worker cooperative self-managed enterprise, although they exist, can barely compete against a capitalist enterprise that exploits its workers in a capitalist world.</p>

<p>You claim we live in a capitalist world that relies on the state. I claim there is no capitalist world if it relies on the state. We can&#39;t argue if you can&#39;t agree on that.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Capitalism is not a business model that can be enforced. It is the natural extension of nature and evolution. Look at animals, look at plants. You can find the same structures. There are niches, competition, symbiosis, specialization, optimization. You can&#39;t live against the will of nature and life. And that does not mean that you have to kill your enemies and that the weak deserve to die. Voluntary donations are a thing, believe it or not. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes, but if there was no state his ownership would be recognized by the people. He either bought it from someone who had owned it or he discovered it first. He does not rely on the state, he has to put up with it.</p>

<p>That&#39;s sadly not how it works. Those psychopaths that strive for power and have no soul will succeed in every system because they&#39;re not held back by empathy. They&#39;re very good at manipulating us with fear and greed. They will be able to replace all the good people in a couple of years and then they will change the system as they need. (That&#39;s exactly what is happening right now around the world. Capitalist countries are turned into &quot;socialist&quot; countries. I know we don&#39;t agree on the term socialist.) I am however, against laws that favour a specific group of people, that&#39;s not what capitalism is about. And not all rich people are capitalists, I hope that&#39;s understandable. There are some rich politicians out there who advocate &quot;socialism&quot; they&#39;re quite rich. There are people like me who are not rich and who would call themselves capitalist. Don&#39;t favour the rich, but equally don&#39;t piss on their leg.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not capitalism if there are laws made by the sate. It would be stupid for trump to not use these laws because it would give him a disadvantage compared to all the other businesses who would use it. This law was probably lobbied by rich people but I would not call them capitalists just because they&#39;re rich.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s also the antithesis of capitalism. You don&#39;t bail out banks if they fuck up. They get weeded out by the system. That&#39;s the marked.</p>

<p>No, it&#39;s not capitalist because the state is bigger than ever. I agree, there are some wealthy assholes that want to take other peoples money away. But they&#39;re not capitalists.

<p>Yes, I will keep educating myself. I feel the same for you. I&#39;ll keep an eye open and try to see it your way when I&#39;m reading the news. It&#39;s important to note, however, that we&#39;re both on same page on trying to make the world a better place. I think we can agree that we&#39;re not trying to cheat the system or feel like we deserve more than other people. Even if we disagree on the means of getting there, the over all intent is the same. </p>

<p>Putting our ideologies aside, the best thing we could do to better this world is to become better ourselves. All those fucked up people that  want to control us, are a reflection of our society. They can play with us because we&#39;re weak and fearful. So let&#39;s just try to become the best versions of ourselves and the ideology is just a secondary thing. The world would be a better place irregardless of the system we live in.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Fair enough, but Richard Wolff addresses this argument in the second part of the video. He makes the distinction between private capitalism and state capitalism and how every economic system had a private and state sector. Slave systems had private and state owned plantations. Feudal systems had serfs owned by private (Lords) and state. Capitalism is much the same and in his example the post office is a state capitalist enterprise. Functionally the surplus value produced by USPS goes to the state managers who then decide what to do with it. USPS workers get paid a wage. This is functionally capitalism as it has all the elements of capitalism: Wage, profit extraction, workers distinct from bosses. In the video you can see his argument @ 17:30 where he talks about state capitalism.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Capitalism is not a business model that can be enforced. It is the natural extension of nature and evolution. Look at animals, look at plants. You can find the same structures.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is capitalist ideology to suggest it is part of human nature. Every oppressive system justifies its existence on something beyond our control. The question I pose to you is where in animals and plants do they have a notion of private property? If Capitalism cannot be enforced, then explain how a capitalist can claim to own a natural resource with a piece of paper? He can only do this through the threat of violence if the community does not accept that piece of paper claiming he, and he alone, is entitled to that natural resource because he used something called money to purchase it. Tell me how else one person can claim ownership over a natural resource if not enforced through private property laws.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes, but if there was no state his ownership would be recognized by the people. He either bought it from someone who had owned it or he discovered it first. He does not rely on the state, he has to put up with it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bought it with what? Money? Who backs this money? The state. Why would people recognize someone&#39;s claim to a lake because he has pieces of paper with dead presidents on it? Historically, what people have recognized is those using a piece of land gets the products they produce with their labour. It is only through systems like capitalism does this notion of private property come into play. Locals all over the world protest when a company claims ownership of resources they&#39;ve been using for thousands of years. The reason why the state recognizes and violently defends the company&#39;s claim over the local community&#39;s claim is because the company has enough state money to trade for state protection. The fact of the matter is, in the real world, you cannot separate capitalist claim to private property from state.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am however, against laws that favour a specific group of people, that&#39;s not what capitalism is about.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Except that is what it&#39;s about. What do you think TTP, TTIP, etc are about? Those are agreements created by capitalists to server their own interests at the expense of others. It is class warfare. The capitalist class and the working class have conflicting interests, this is just the reality and so long as there is class conflict there will be one group trying to dominate the other and since the capitalist class holds the bulk of the wealth, they dominate over us. Those supposed &quot;socialists&quot; who are wealthy are mostly liberals, not socialists. Those like Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, George Soros, are liberals attempting to maintain their power but through a compassionate form of capitalist, as opposed to people like Kochs. Both are capitalists and seek to expand it or save it depending on whether they&#39;re on the left or right of the capitalist class. As socialists we seek to get people like you to become class conscious. Understand we do belong to classes, we have class interests, and we are in the middle of a class war and the capitalist class is winning.</p>

<p>You say you&#39;re a capitalist, but what you mean is you&#39;re pro-capitalism. A capitalist is someone who actually does not need to work for a living, but makes his living by owning capital and taking the surplus value (ex: profit) produced by his/her workers. Capitalists also promote their ideology because it benefits them to have workers be pro-capitalists as it prevents workers from being class conscious and challenging their hegemonic power.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They might be spreading misinformation. But that&#39;s not argument. That doesn&#39;t make capitalism wrong.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re right, capitalism is not objectively wrong. For capitalists capitalism is absolutely right.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No, it&#39;s not capitalist because the state is bigger than ever. I agree, there are some wealthy assholes that want to take other peoples money away. But they&#39;re not capitalists. They&#39;re just rich psychopaths that use unfair tactics by using government, media and private corporations to fuck us all over. They want us all to be mindless slaves without any power. That&#39;s why want to take our private property away.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m afraid you&#39;re putting capitalism in a bubble that makes it immune from any criticism. If you say that &quot;rich psychopaths&quot; are not capitalists, you&#39;re basically saying capitalism is good but the moment rich people do something bad they cease to be capitalist. If we look at what a capitalist really is - one who makes a living from the profits extracted from the surplus value produced by their employees - then we see we have both good and bad capitalists, but one thing is for sure, as capitalists as a class have certain interests that are diametrically opposed to the interests of the working class. </p>

<p>My argument, and one that Peter Joseph puts forward eloquently, is that the rationale of the system elevates the rich psychopaths over the benevolent rich. &quot;use unfair tactics by using government, media and private corporations to fuck us all over&quot; is a perfectly rational thing a capitalist would want to do to beat out their competition. That is the problem. Capitalism encourages that kind of behaviour. It rewards it.</p>

<p>I agree we need to become better ourselves, but we must also realize that our culture, ideas, etc are corrupted by the ruling class and we must be conscious of class and class warfare. This helps us understand why the wealthy elite do what they do. Why us, as workers, are being enslaved by debt and must payback this debt doing jobs we don&#39;t like earning wages that remain low. This isn&#39;t accidental. This isn&#39;t government incompetency. This is intentional and neoliberalism with austerity are just the latest assaults on our class by the capitalist class.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll just end it at this. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll convince you, but hopefully I&#39;ve at least opened you up to the idea that you have misunderstood socialism, as I have in the past as well. I do urge you to seek out what socialism actually means by actual socialists and avoid liberal and conservative sources. Peter Joseph does have some good critiques of capitalism and market systems, which I think is essential to understand these flaws before looking at socialism. I think once people recognize the inherent flaws of capitalism that gives rise to a powerful ruling class, as past economic systems have done, then they will seek better alternatives on their own. </p>

<p>This is capitalist ideology to suggest it is part of human nature. Every oppressive system justifies its existence on something beyond our control. The question I pose to you is where in animals and plants do they have a notion of private property?</p>

<p>Dogs and cats pee on their property :)</p>

<p>Bought it with what? Money? Who backs this money? The state. Why would people recognize someone&#39;s claim to a lake because he has pieces of paper with dead presidents on it? Historically, what people have recognized is those using a piece of land gets the products they produce with their labour.</p>

<p>Gold for example or money that is backed by gold. He could also trade wood or pigs and apples. Gold is just easier.</p>

<p>I&#39;m afraid you&#39;re putting capitalism in a bubble that makes it immune from any criticism. If you say that &quot;rich psychopaths&quot; are not capitalists, you&#39;re basically saying capitalism is good but the moment rich people do something bad they cease to be capitalist.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, I&#39;m not. Morality is still a thing. You can&#39;t just do whatever you want. You can only do those things that do not harm other people. You can not steal, you can not harm.</p>

<p>I think the problem is that we&#39;re trying to convince each other. Maybe we&#39;re both wrong. Your arguments haven&#39;t shifted my opinion by an inch and I suspect the same on your side.</p>

<p>Thank you for debating with me but I think we&#39;ve reached a dead end here. I wouldn&#39;t worry too much about ideology. The power lies within our good actions and not in the system.</p>

<p>Explain to me why people call them &quot;cultural Marxists&quot;. Do you understand why SJWs get called &quot;Marxist&quot;? Hint: It&#39;s not because they are socialist/communist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was popularized by Christian conservatives such as Pat Buchanan. Those on the economic right had made an unholy alliance with the Christian right and just as the economic right accused anyone to the left of them being a &quot;marxist&quot;, &quot;socialist&quot; and so on, the Christian right accused anyone socially to the left of them of being a &quot;cultural&quot; Marxist. I do find it interesting the the Nazis used this same technique against their opponents by calling them &quot;cultural Bolsheviks&quot;.</p>

<p>Anyway, they had some legitimate concerns such as the destruction of the family. However, it was not homosexuals marrying that was destroying the family. Ironically, capitalism (the very thing they defended) is what has destroyed family and community. The reason why most families now depend on the state (or private) daycare is because both parents must work to make ends meet. Communities have also been replaced with ideology of individualism. With regards to religion, capitalist culture has turned their Jesus into Santa Clause and their religious holidays into consumerist events. So they get mad at &quot;cultural Marxists&quot; because Walmart says &quot;happy holidays&quot; instead of &quot;merry Christmas&quot;. Of course, the Christian right leaders won&#39;t make this connection because they are well paid by business elites who they have allied themselves with.</p>

<p>EDIT: And on multiculturalism there is irony too. Capitalism is the reason why many are migrating from their homes seeking a better life. I am not against cultures living together peacefully, but this is not what is happening now. What&#39;s happening is people from different cultures are forced to leave their homes ravished by capitalist wars and live in someone else&#39;s home under very difficult circumstances. This sort of environment only breeds animosity between cultures partly because it&#39;s not a situation that neither the native nor the migrant wanted, but were forced to accept due to capitalist forces at play and partly because it is more competition within the local labour market</p>
