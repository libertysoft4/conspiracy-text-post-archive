<p>And we found out recently that Israel ends up with most of the oil ISIS is selling. The $1.5 million a day that funds ISIS. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3vwryz/isis_is_a_tool_of_western_governments_to/">First link on this page has lots of information about this.</a></p>

<p>So what is the purpose of Genie Energy? Is it really 100% about the oil, or is it about the desire to expand Israel to create <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VoBH86DTwDA/hqdefault.jpg">&quot;Greater Israel&quot; from the Euphrates to the Nile</a>, just as the Torah/Bible promised the Zionists? (Zionists are people who want Mount Zion in Jerusalem back, aka they want Palestine gone. People of this belief largely run the governments of Israel and the US.) Or is this just another pressure point on Syria to destabilize it so they can set up their own government and banking system? Is it all of these things combined?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing will ever be certain, nor will it ever be possible to prove it, all we can do is suspect, unfortunately :/</p>

<p>The little bits of information here and would not be enough to hold with any court (not that taking a corporation / the whole nation to court is feasible).</p>

<p>We can only spectate, the general population (throughout the world, not only in the western nations) has little interest in revolting, and TPTB is actively combating our capabilities to unite.</p>

<p>But I&#39;m glad we still have the means to discuss the observations, we should savor every moment, because I&#39;m certain that we have but 2-3 years, before the internet is de-anonymized worldwide and boards such as <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> will become distant memories.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I fear you are right, which is why it&#39;s so important to take this window of opportunity where the internet is free to wake people up to downplayed truths as much as possible. Informed people have a lot better chance than those who don&#39;t know hidden truths.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m afraid that window closed a few years ago.</p>

<p>I&#39;m more than certain that in an event of domestic uproar and unrest, US government would simply start using drones, claiming that they are fighting domestic terrorists, and it would further their cause. And the rest of the world has similar plans, or is even ahead of the US (China&#39;s Firewall, Russia&#39;s censorship, Kazachstan&#39;s mandatory installation of gov&#39;t spyware, Five Eye&#39;s mass internet surveillance going on for the past decade).</p>

<p>I mean we can try informing people, but I&#39;ve lost any hope for a significant impact and altering of the status quo. Things will only and have always deteriorated. I&#39;m sorry if I sound decadent and defeatist, but there&#39;s a plethora of evidence that we&#39;re royally fucked, with no way out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Psh, it is not closed. I just wrote an article yesterday that got 10,000 views and was deeply questioning the mainstream narrative in a way that would be censored. But I did have to write it on this subreddit...</p>

<p>There&#39;s going to be some kind of war, no doubt, but it&#39;s a matter of mitigation. If some more people are informed, maybe one bombing campaign can be avoided for a particular burst of public outrage that wouldn&#39;t have happened otherwise. </p>

<p>It&#39;s okay to feel defeated though, it&#39;s not your job nor my job to save the world. It&#39;s just nice to try and make things a little better when you can. I bet people felt the same way during the last two world wars. Things will improve and deteriorate, improve and deteriorate, it&#39;s the story of our species. Things may not be so fun for the next decade, but I bet the decade after that will probably be relatively nice. Just like the 40s vs the 50s. Or the 1910s vs the 20s. It goes in cycles, it&#39;s just a bad time now. Also being in the US means we&#39;re in a collapsing 200-year empire, so it&#39;d probably be best to go to another country at some point instead of just riding it out, imo. It&#39;s going to be so much more exaggerated in the US then other places, because we have so much farther to fall. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a great place for now though, they don&#39;t want to get too crazy over there with Taiwan. There is a nice stalemate. I lived there for a year, I never felt unsafe. In fact the crime rate is super low, as low as japan. But if there was military troubles I would try to leave. Also the east side of the island is very beautiful and probably wouldn&#39;t be involved in any attack and would give you plenty of time to get out. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s as big a concern as living in a big US city... I dunno.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, many people sharing sources of information, surely none are better than <a href="http://genieoilgas.com/about-us/strategic-advisory-board/">GENIEs website themselves for teh big names</a>. </p>

<p>Spent a small amount of time looking into this just last week when I stumbled across an image macro on Facebook claiming Murdoch&#39;s news empire rush to war in the UK was for Syrian oil.</p>

<p>Brief timeline : </p>

<p>Feb 2013 - <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/israel-grants-golan-heights-oil-license-2013-2?IR=T">GENIE Oil are granted license to explore for oil and gas in Golan Heights</a> - Rather contentious since Golan Heights are Syrian territory illegally occupied by Israel, but at this stage it&#39;s only exploration</p>

<p>Oct 2015 - reports that <a href="https://www.rt.com/business/317906-oil-golan-heights-israel/">billions of barrels of oil have been found at sites in Golan Heights</a></p>

<p>w/c 2nd November 2015 - <a href="http://www.theecologist.org/News/news_round_up/2986289/israel_to_annex_golan_heights_after_billion_barrel_oil_find.html">Netanyahu seeks US support to officially annex Golan Heights</a> (I wonder why). Apparently this support didn&#39;t happen</p>

<p>15 November 2015 - Bataclan concert hall massacre. Despite being attributed to French and Belgian nationals, there is sudden an over whelming urge in France and the UK, especially in the right wing media (owned by Murdoch), to step up bombing campaigns in Syria</p>

<p>Now, since Golan Heights is illegally occupied, Israel cannot claim the oil in those lands, it is Syria&#39;s oil after all, as recognised by the international community. Can&#39;t imagine Assad being too happy with the West and/or Israel taking his country&#39;s liquid gold. 
However, should the Assad regime be replaced by a puppet government, or the entire region thrown into complete chaos? Well, that might make it a bit easier for the oil to be claimed and sold</p>

<p>I&#39;m not convinced there is a higher agenda here other than what we already know. Steal oil. Sell oil. Destabilise the Arabic Middle East. </p>

<p>I mean, think about it: if there is oil in the Golan Heights, does Isreal really have to be there to get it? We have the technology to drill at 90 degree angles. They could have easily built a rig well within Israeli borders and drill at an angle to get it, i.e. I drink your milkshake. </p>

<p>There has to be something else there as well, like Lithium or Coltan or something. </p>

<p>Also just found this, too.  Apparently the CEO of France&#39;s second largest energy company- Total Energy, was killed in a plane crash in Moscow at the end of 2014.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll also point out that Nobel Energy is the US company currently drilling in the mediterranean on the Leviathon field.

    <div class="md"><p>Do the oil/gas reserves under Golan magically stop at the Syrian border?</p>

<p>I doubt it, and neither to the ambitions of Genie Energy <strong>or</strong> the Zionist State.</p>

<p>I have long said that one of Israel&#39;s primary goals WRT the Syrian coup is to <a href="http://i.imgur.com/IPwJ9PE.png">SNATCH a huge swath of Syrian land</a> that lies adjacent to the Golan Heights - which is not only coveted for its mineral reserves, but because it contains some of the most fertile farmland in the entire Middle East.</p>

<p>And of course, there are the &quot;Greater Israel&quot; ambitions mentioned by OP - the Conquest that is everpresent in the minds of the Zionist Colonists.</p>

<p>But when the SNATCH happens, Israel will insist that it is necessary for &quot;security purposes&quot;.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t they always?</p>

One was Larry Summers, who was treasury secretary in the Clinton administration and director of the National Economic Council under Barack Obama. Also added were two other Clinton-era appointees: Bill Richardson, an ex-ambassador to the United Nations and energy secretary, and James Woolsey, a former CIA director.</a></p>

<p>Does that guy seriously have nothing better to do than help out this oil company with geopolitical advice? I can&#39;t imagine they&#39;d pay him enough to make it worth his time. Unless it was pushing Zionist goals, which he&#39;s a big fan of.  </p>

<p>Genie Energy&#39;s Strategic advisory board is composed of Dick Cheney...</p>

<p>so maybe they&#39;re not company officers? it&#39;s still a connection, just a <em>different</em> one</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True it doesn&#39;t seem like they&#39;re company officers after some research... here&#39;s a list of the major shareholders: <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/mh?s=GNE+Major+Holders">http://finance.yahoo.com/q/mh?s=GNE+Major+Holders</a></p>

<p>Not those guys.</p>

<p>But as you see at the bottom there are a lot of hedge funds that have major holding positions, like Vanguard which I think is owned by Rothschild. So while they have an advisory position, it&#39;s also possible they have voting rights on the actual board of directors, via these mutual funds and investment companies.</p>

Like as if they have some connection to the divine. It freaks people out but really, it&#39;s all just stories. But they stir people&#39;s emotions in ways that gives them a free pass. It&#39;s a power grab.</p>

<p>Think about it, Zionism is an entire religious ideology basically created around the single idea of taking land away from Palestine. But the power grab is the primary drive, the religious prophecy crap is just another tool for them to use to control the opinions of masses and get the war they want in the way they want, no matter how many decades it takes them. The religion is a shield to hide their crimes.</p>
