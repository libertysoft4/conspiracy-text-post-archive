        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>After &quot;opening my mind&quot; and contemplating a lot of things, I realized something that was right in front of my face. In fact, realizing it was personally a very eerie experience. I realized that the government created rap music to keep us close-minded, hateful, and glued to material objects. Now, you already think I&#39;m crazy I assume because rap is the most popular genre of music as of now, but the things I am about to tell you might change your mind. In the 60&#39;s two very big things were happening. One, LSD was now introduced to the public, and second, the Vietnam War was unfortunately happening. Now, in my United States history class we talked about how people were not funding the Vietnam War because they were taking LSD, listening to the decade defining music known as Psychedelic Rock, and &quot;freeing their minds&quot; from hate, violence, and material objects. This got me questioning the situation. Take a moment to think about what you would do to get people to fund the Vietnam War. Obviously, you&#39;d get rid of the things stopping them from funding the war. (LSD and Psychedelic Rock). Then, what do you know ... LSD was immediately illegalized and scheduled as a class III drug. (Which basically means your life is over if you&#39;re caught with it.) Around this exact same time, a new genre of music was also introduced to the public: Hip-Hop. Hip-Hop was originally typically a simple beat with some funky bass lines and a man rapping over the beat usually about things that typically weren&#39;t considered important. It was mainly played at clubs or parties and was really popular until the late 70&#39;s. Compared to the wild notes and lyrics that were supposedly freeing peoples minds in 60&#39;s, Hip-Hop seemed to not be headed in that direction. This is where you might not consider me as crazy hopefully. Around the 90&#39;s is when Hip-Hop evolved into a darker version of the genre: Rap. Rap&#39;s main message was exactly what the government would want us to be listening to. It&#39;s almost insane that we don&#39;t see how bold that is. I mean, if you were to turn on the radio and go to a rap station you&#39;d hear at least 9/10 songs talking about buying things, repopulating, and killing people all in a monotone voice with a lazy beat behind it. These things are all the EXACT opposite of the message of Psychedelic Rock. It&#39;s very scary to contemplate sometimes how it all spawned from Hip-Hop: A music genre founded along side the illegalization of LSD. I hope I don&#39;t sound to crazy, but to finish off this text wall I&#39;ll summarize my conspiracy .... + 60&#39;s music freed peoples minds from material objects (material objects gives the government money). The way the government ended that was by popularizing a genre of music that&#39;s main message is killing people, buying into/obsessing over material objects, and spreading hate. Side Note 2: +Not all rap music is about the evil it&#39;s made out to be. You can find art in anything. </p>

<p>But so what? </p>

<p>You are trying to link, having associations with someone who is Jewish as being controlled by Jews </p>

<p>The lack of logic in this sub is amazing. Maybe it got taken away.....by the jooozzzzzz</p>

<p>And the beastie boys are the only top rappers you can list who are Jewish. Nice job, you deserve a cookie </p>

<p>Next time you want to support asinine claims, have more evidence. Beastie boys wouldn&#39;t even be considered top ten </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry but you need to do your research before you say something like this. Listen to some KRS - one, Immortal Technique, Lowkey, Akala, DISL automatic. Hip hop began as a voice for the lower class, It was a culture that spawned from a lifestyle. Modern day hip hop, the crap you hear on the radio is definitely influenced by major record labels and in turn the government. Hip hop began as a voice for the people, as a way to spread messages of love and unity. The government and so called powers that be realized this and were afraid of the lower class unifying through hip hop and so they took what was (and definitely still is if you find the right artists) a beautiful art form backed by loving messages and turned it into the ugly materialistic, consumer-friendly beast it is today. All mainstream hip hop, at least the vast majority of it promotes murder, drugs and most of all materialism. This is a direct result of the ghetto-bred capitalist mentality and the guidance of the new world order through record labels. Listen to some Immortal technique, listen to some lowkey, Akala and Disl Automatic if you are truly interested in this topic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice theory. The only thing that didn&#39;t make sense to me is when you said that people weren&#39;t funding the Vietnam war. What do you mean by that? The other thing I would say, is that you need some evidence to back up your theory. I&#39;m not trying to shoot your theory down. I&#39;m just saying that your logic is sound, but you need evidence to back it up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re completely right. I&#39;m in U.S. History currently and we were talking about how LSD was preventing people from funding the war, so that&#39;s where I got that information if that helps.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have a very narrow view of rap. The radio tends to play only the catchiest tunes of any given genre so of course you&#39;re going to get a bad/shallow impression. 
Trust me I used to feel the same way but I gave real hip hop a shot and now it&#39;s my favorite genre, there&#39;s just nothing like it. The clever flows and metaphors, the intricate rhyme patterns, and a lot of rappers have real substance to their lyrics. Check out non phixion, Mos def, lupe fiasco, immortal technique, Ill bill, De la soul, earl sweatshirt etc.. then get back to me.</p>

<p>Also you mention that people were not &quot;funding&quot; the war because they were taking lsd. Could you elaborate? I believe wars are paid for through taxes and debt obligations if I&#39;m not mistaken so I don&#39;t think their was really much choice in the matter for the average citizen on whether they wanted to &quot;fund&quot; the war or not</p>

    <div class="md"><p>here&#39;s a link to a book -- called weird scenes inside Laurel Canyon -- that supports the entire musical revolution of the 60&#39;s was a government agenda to flood the anti-war movement with druggies and hippies, in efforts to weaken and dissolve it. <a href="http://www.davesweb.cnchost.com/">http://www.davesweb.cnchost.com/</a>
summaries of chapters are found in links on the site. you will probably find it pretty interesting.</p>

<p>also, rap, totally meant to destroy the black community. -- look at Jay Z -- selling drugs turned out to be the best investment in that guys life. how many &quot;oh-zee&#39;s&quot; did he have to sell, before he cashed out and got a record deal where he could rap about it for the next thirty years. -- I wonder. crime is encouraged, so they can fill the prisons. (with slaves). before the &#39;60&#39;s, the black family unit was very strong, divorce rates were low. they were trapped in ghetto&#39;s where opportunities were low, the black man was denied work -- and aid was given to families that did Not have a man in the house. the father was cut out of the picture. children were raised with no fathers. yeah, I wonder when the black community will stop supporting rappers that rap about drugs, objectifying women, exploitation, self-indulgence, apathy, consumerism, and crime-life, etc, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactely, and yet a growing amount blame &quot;white-Privelidge&quot; for their Ill&#39;s. I also think THAT is a covert gov&#39;t sponsored front to cause trouble and distratc people from more important issues. NOT that racial inequality and things like that Aren&#39;t important, because they are...Every race of people should be treated equally b/c its the right thing to do, but thats my opinion. Anyway...I agree with alot of what you said. When the Black panthers were established, the gov&#39;t did everything they could to destroy them. And eventually they succeeded, with GANGS and CRACK. Crack was distributed thru inner city &#39;hoods and peoples lives were fucking destroyed. That shit was purposefully made strong, likely maybe even engineered in a lab, to kill and get people hooked. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Before I even read this, there was a lot of shit in the 40s and 50s that was &quot;rap&quot; as we know it. Scat etc. etc. and other countries have rap-like tunes from the past. Rap &quot;as we know it&quot; that is shitted out of TV onto your eye balls, that was created by some sort of fraternal order / government, but I am not sure the exact group. There is a few theories that bad rap music increases criminal behaviors, and raises stock prices, of publicly traded prison stocks like $GEO and $CXW. <a href="http://www.complex.com/music/2013/11/rap-conspiracy-theories/record-labels-own-stock-in-jails">http://www.complex.com/music/2013/11/rap-conspiracy-theories/record-labels-own-stock-in-jails</a><br/>

    <div class="md"><p>Something to keep in mind. A lot of America&#39;s radio stations are owned and/or controlled by Mormons via Mobile Romney and  Bain Capital.<br/>
That should tell you a lot about what&#39;s going on in the music industry.<br/>
Btw, rap is not the only genre of music this has happened to. Country music is another genre that, imo, has been hijacked by the corporatistas. Don&#39;t believe me? Ask the Dixie Chicks.</p>

IMO, the rise of the whole two turntables and a microphone thing is the result of the cuts to music education in schools.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rap music actually originated in places like jamaica, kinda ..the beat and dancing was taken from that type of tribal music/dancing, and when started in america, rap was very very positive and all about the troubles these people faced and how they were gonna overcome their situation. NOW, its the exact opposite. Its all about things that oppress people..Money and material objects. Theres no personal style anymore, its alla bout &quot;fashion and trends&quot; in everything from clothes, to art, to tech. Everyone is consuming instead of creating. Everything now is bought. Nothing is made. While their may be a few out there like Holtz, who go out and do things and build stuff, most have been condiitoned to always buy, buy buy. People dont even buy albums anymore, they download them. Easy to delete, make room for more. No feel anymore, nothing permanent. Thats the way TPTB want it. Easier to remove or take away, and start anew. Like 1984, The news always changes, papers are burned. I really think i was born in the wrong year. Ive always wanted to be a part of the 50&#39;s, when america made shit and we exported things. Cars were cooler, and had style, and so did people. They all dresses nice, button up shirts. Nowadays, were all a walking billboard. Why do we wear t-shirts with a Logo on it now? Whats that for? What are we doing? It&#39;s like having a logo on your car, or tattooed on you is cool now. Why? </p>
