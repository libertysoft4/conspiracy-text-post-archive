        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>TLDR: alchemists were making DMT</p>

<p>The conventional understanding of alchemy is that it was an arcane <em>protochemistry</em> by unsophisticated ancients who were breaking into the roots of modern science, and whose goal was to convert base metals such as lead to gold.</p>

<p>Those who have studied the occult know that this is totally wrong, that alchemy was an internal craft of refining one&#39;s mental faculties, turning himself (a leaden mind) into gold (a mind perfected), by metaphorically emulating stages of chemical process (distillation, putrification, fermentation, rarefaction, etc) of dissolution and then reintegration (&#39;solve coagula&#39;).  This was done through the language of symbols and a deep mediation on the symbols as aspects of the self Thus, alchemy was a type of mystical self-psychology that was later popularized by Carl Jung and his personality archetypes (&quot;Man and his symbols&quot;) and touched upon by Joseph Campbell and his explanation of the self as a universal mythology (&quot;hero with a thousand faces&quot;).  These ideas were further elaborated to a very high degree through Terence McKenna, who found parallels between <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YNdBpYh1eA">shamanism, psychedelic drug use and alchemy</a>, finding the thread that connected all three together, which was the idea that reality is made of language, and that the psychedelic experience was a place in which language was unconstrained, boundaryless--and by extension so was reality.  Thus, one is living literally in imagination.  Through this trait, McKenna asserted, one is then able to change their minds--quite literally--and therefore the world around them.  The psychedelic experience was then, to <a href="https://youtu.be/rjCjwZfyyBM?t=1731">Mckenna, a type of alchemy.</a></p>

<p>That said, when one studies even deeper the histories of alchemy--whether real or legendary--by looking into the famous figures such as Paracelsus, John Dee, Sir Isaac Newton, St. Germain, etc one hears stories of con-artistry and woo, many failures, flights of fancy and fleeced royals.  Chickens fed bowls of serpents and vinegar.  It seems, however, they weren&#39;t as successful at transmuting lead to gold as they had claimed.  But certainly, there was no shortage of people willing to sponsor their efforts!</p>

<p>And of course, when you look at descriptions of ancient lab equipment (or those preserved in heidelberg as shown by mckenna in his movie), it nearly always included <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Book-Aquarius-Alchemy-Philosophers/dp/1451020163%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAILSHYYTFIVPWUY6Q%26tag%3Dduckduckgo-d-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D1451020163">a reference to urine and the refining / slow heating of urine for a very long time (reduction)</a>.  This was said to produce either <a href="http://alchemy-forums.forumotion.com/t81-the-white-stone-of-urine">a white</a> or purple stone, which is said to be white phosphorus, a key ingredient in flash grenades and early photography.  Symbolically, this was considered to be the &#39;light of life&#39; that was collected and refined, but this was [not the philosopher&#39;s stone, because--as we said before--alchemy was psychological and thus the stone is a mental construct.  </p>

<p>I believe this &#39;heating the first urine collected at dawn&#39; (Order of the Golden Dawn) to be yet another misdirection to throw people off from the real knowledge of the craft.</p>

<p>However, it seems that the alchemists <em>were up to something</em> in burning the midnight oil to refine their insidiously smelly pee for years at a time.  Because they did engage in this activity.  What was it?  What possible motivation could this be?  What were they trying to make?</p>

<p>Consider this factoid: The &#39;third eye&#39;, the pineal gland organ was assayed as having high concentrations of DMT.  It seems its function is to release small amounts daily for dreaming, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N,N-Dimethyltryptamine#Detection_in_body_fluids">large amounts upon death</a>.  It&#39;s also the case the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1070024">DMT is excreted by everyone in urine, albeit in small amounts in regular people and in much larger amounts in mentally ill people</a>, specifically schizophrenics (in archaic times: &quot;witches&quot;, &quot;wizards&quot;, &quot;sorcerors&quot;, &quot;visionaries&quot;, &quot;prophets&quot;, &quot;lunatics&quot;).  According to Dennis McKenna, Terence&#39;s brother, people with <em>temporal lobe epilepsy</em>.</p>

<p>It is not only possible, but likely that heating urine carefully, over a candle, and distilling the vapors, one could, with sufficiently large amounts of urine over a long enough time, could recapture and refine dmt, &#39;the philosophers stone&#39;, which is itself--to anyone who has taken it--not only a chemical, but not unlike other psychedelics is a transdimensional enzyme that unlocks doors to infinity, wherein magick truly does exist.</p>

<p>Of course, many other reactions would be needed to separate dmt from all the other things present in urine, but those are details best left to chemists who also have a fetish for ancient protochemistry.</p>

<p>Shifting gears a bit--who were the alchemists?  They were part of an elite group of clergy class that was not involved directly with politics due to their activities of grifting royals, travelling &quot;from library to library&quot;, from mentor to mentor, etc seeking truths, seeking the stone.  They were Rosicrucians, Templars, Knights of Malta, who vanguarded ancient mysteries passed down from various eclectic occultic traditions harkening back to ancient egypt and beyond.  They incorporated traditions from the essenes, the eleusinians, the mithraic, orphic and other roman mystery cult / school traditions and other pagan witchcraft folkloric traditions such as astrotheology, syncretizing the sum total of wisdom one complete alternative mystic teaching called &#39;alchemy&#39;.</p>

<p>Freemasons eventually adopted and took over the Rosicrucian tradition, and cryptographically encoded the use of visionary sacraments, alchemy, and the mysteries as symbols within their motifs.  &quot;Solve Coagula&quot; is shown upon Levi&#39;s Baphomet, this means dissolution -- reintegration.  This is futher shown in the Waite Deck of the Tarot&#39;s Magician with the same body position, pointing above and below, to mimick the hermetic / gnostic tenet of &#39;as above so below&#39;.  In the contemplation room of lodges, it&#39;s said there are relics including momento mori of skulls and human bones, as well as the phrase &quot;V.I.T.R.I.O.L -- visita interiora terra rectificando invienes occultum lapidum&quot;-- visit the interior of the earth and there you will find the hidden stone.  In this case, it&#39;s talking about going deep into your mind to find the metaphorical stone.  </p>

<p>Finally, the <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/mas/sof/sof30.htm">Acacia leaves</a> (whose more common names are &quot;gum arabic&quot; or &quot;egyptian thorn&quot;) are always shown in freemasonic motifs.  The exoteric reason for this is that <a href="http://www.masonic-lodge-of-education.com/acacia.html">Solomons temple and the ark of the covenant were made of Acacia wood</a>.  The esoteric reason I posit is that <em>Acacia</em> is a specific genus whose species members nearly all contain psychedelic DMT (and methamphetamine, phenylethylamine (mescaline)) in significantly large amounts to be able to refine, extract and utilize for the purposes of psychedelic use.  In fact, ayahuasca is an admixture containing a DMT relative of acacia, the mimosa, along with an oral activator that inhibits an enzyme that prevents DMT from being orally active.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, the great work of alchemy is the unification of opposites and the resolution of paradoxes.  This is why the psychedelic experience works so perfectly, its a living place of paradox as the boundaries between concepts are dissolved and the nondualisms (light and dark being two sides of the same thing) are resolved (ex: The Disney movie &quot;Inside out&quot; in which the &#39;core memory&quot; in the end was a combination of both joy and sadness--this is a perfect gnostic theme.  Did you get that?).  Psychedelic experience however is not the only means to achieve this state of unity.  Psychological dissociation will work.  And that can be achieved by severe abuse, by mental illness (schizophrenia, extreme depersonalization), and total overstimulation, or complete fragementation of ones worldview.  9/11&#39;s tower collapses were an example of global dissociation, as we watched in disbelieve, for a moment, we all thought a similar thing: this can&#39;t be real: pinch me, I&#39;m in the twilight zone.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, I believe <a href="https://www.academia.edu/10337663/THE_USE_OF_DMT_IN_EARLY_MASONIC_RITUAL">Freemasons of a certain degree are psychonautical alchemists</a>.  So if that&#39;s the case, why have they--whose ranks form a large majority of most major political institutions worldwide--crafted such a prohibitive drug policy, specifically, and viciously inhibiting psychedelics, keeping them far from the hands of the so called &#39;squares&#39; (us, the non-elite)?  If it&#39;s so great, and if the Freemason as such pious, good-intentioned people, and their exlir so magical and perfecting, then shouldn&#39;t they then find a way to bring it back to the lumpen masses to help everyone &#39;perfect themselves&#39;?  </p>

<p>Why not turn everyone into gold?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The biggest mystery is the nonfalsifiability of both your assertion and mine.  It&#39;s also possible they do both <a href="/r/rationalpsychonaut">/r/rationalpsychonaut</a>, which happens to be what I think they did.  People who do psychedelics fall into 2 camps: irresponsible people who do it recreationally; and people who use it as a tool for growth, finding answers about themselves and the world around them</p>

<p>There is, however, is much evidence from multiple sources including dead sea scrolls, apocryphal chapters, nag hamadi and other historical religious indian texts on the use of visionary sacraments (psychedelics) in mystery schools, referred to as soma, haoma, kykeon, ambrosia, amrita, nectar, elixir of life.  People who&#39;ve studied mystery schools and gnosticism extensively like Carl AP Ruck have many candidates for the ingredients in these things, including acacia, ephedra, mushrooms (specifically a type of ergot / parasitic fungus that grows on rye/barley/bearded darnel that doesn&#39;t cause &#39;st vitis dance&#39; or st anthony&#39;s fire, a terrible disease that necrotizes the extremitities and feels like burning fire), syrian rue, and various other plants or even possibly an extinct plant</p>

<p>Anyway, thank you for the thoughtful comment.</p>

<p>The philosopher&#39;s stone is the beating heart.  It&#39;s what drives action, through which godliness exists.  Alchemy only represents the change that drives us.  What we wish to produce and create.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The astral perisprit is contained and confined within the physical body as ether in a bottle, or magnetism in magnetized iron. It is a centre and engine of force, fed from the universal supply of force, and moved by the same general laws which pervade all nature and produce all cosmical phenomena.Its inherent activity causes the incessant physical operations of the animal organism and ultimately results in the destruction of the latter by overuse and its own escape. It is the prisoner, not the voluntary tenant, of the body.</p>

<p>occultism and esotericism is just the usage of symbols and sigils to manipulate thought and drive that change.</p>

<p>You didn&#39;t &quot;correct&quot; my statement.  You told me I was wrong and that what I said was too materialistic.  But what I said didn&#39;t indicate that I was talking about limited to the physical.  Maybe you took me literally when I said that the philisopher&#39;s stone was the beating heart.  It&#39;s not literal- just a symbol.  The quote i used was blavatsky.</p>

<p>You &quot;corrected&quot; me without any correction.  You made an incorrect assumption and told me I was wrong without offering any information to add to what I was saying.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ya, Its really a weird thing. I would say that the key difference in having the effect take hold is passing the threshold of the negative effects. If you don&#39;t ingest enough to peak you just feel really strange, like your body is made of TV static. It can make you feel very irritated and start to associate your negative feelings with the people around you. I suppose I shouldn&#39;t promote its use but I feel that exploring consciousness is one of the few frontiers us common plebs can explore without too much backlash.</p>

<p>Then again the mind is a delicate organ and one should do their best not to damage it. We all have our things to work through, self exploration kept me off of pharmaceuticals for depression and insomnia. The difference between depression and not-depression is a change of attitude.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s easy to guess that the alchemist were up to a lot of different things. Probably, trying to make different kinds of drugs was one of them.</p>

<p>For some reason, most people have this perception that drug use (esp. psychedelics) is something that got started back in the 1960&#39;s. Nothing could be farther from the truth.</p>

<p>I suspect that this perception has deliberately engineered to keep the public ignorant. Something that&#39;s new is more easily seen as suspicious and risky. Something that people have been doing for thousands of years is easily seen as normal, a tradition, even a human right.</p>

<p>He who controls the past, controls the future. Keep people from knowing what they used to be capable of and they&#39;ll be easier to keep under control.</p>

<p>As for DMT and alchemy? I honestly don&#39;t know. There&#39;s other compounds that are very psychoactive and known to be available in Europe at that time. Magic mushrooms are one likely candidate. So are hashish... and harmaline from syrian rue. </p>

<p>I mention harmaline because it is the drug behind all those tales about flying carpets. The Arabs of the medieval period had plenty of scientific knowledge at a time when Europe was still in darkness.</p>

<p>Europeans were also pretty biased against Arabic habits and this is the reason for the general cultural bias against hashish and cannabis. No doubt, the religious leaders of the day would have branded psychedelics as some sort of witchcraft.</p>

<p>So the alchemists might have been running the medieval equivalent of a drug lab. Just like users and dealers today, they would have had to keep a low profile and use their own slang when referring to what they were doing.</p>

<p>This might seem a bit sketchy for some people. But if you think about it, in every place and time in all of human history, people are always trying to get high on <em>something</em>.  </p>

<p>I doubt medieval Europe was any different. If you really want to go deep down the rabbit hole... maybe this was the real secret of the Templar Knights. They went to the middle east during the Crusades and learned about all the awesome drugs people were doing out there. Then they set up a network for dealing back home in Europe and got fucking rich in no time. All the nobility would have been getting stoned all the time and the Templars knew their secret.</p>

<p>Terrence McKenna: “I don&#39;t know how true it is, but is theory is: Jesus was a mushroom. This would not probably have cut too much mustard, except that this guy was a dead sea scholar of world renown. With an academic grasp of Aramaic and Akkadian, and was fully lisenced to be one of the people who tell us what the primary documents of Christianity really mean. The problem is, when the laypeople got a hold of him, he said, &#39;well what they really mean is that a sacramental mushroom was being grown in caves by Nabbateans down in Qumran, and they caled it “Jesus” in order to befuddle the Roman authorities, and created the theory of the friendly carpenter who tells us to render unto Caesar that which was Caesar&#39;s and that this was all just a publicity stunt to keep the Roman authorities guessing, and he claims he has textual support for this, the problem is, you have to be an Aramaic philologist to follow the argument, which is unbelievably tortured.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;re telling me that shamans throughout Central and South America had a comprehensive understanding of how to refine DMT from various plant species for thousands of years, but, even after traveling to these areas and incorporating the occult knowledge of various tribes into their own crafts, the best thing the high magicians of the Middle Ages could come up with is fuckin&#39; <em>Jenkem?</em></p>

<p>I&#39;m just saying, OP. Are you for real with this shit? Your understanding of the esoteric elements of alchemy is sufficiently accurate, but this DMT production theory couldn&#39;t possibly make any sense. Maybe if these magicians really were schizophrenics like you claim - but that&#39;s a pretty ridiculous accusation to make of anyone lucid enough to internalize the principles of alchemy, since doing so definitely requires a competent and able mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, because they didn&#39;t have airplanes and didn&#39;t know about the americas until very late in the game.  Africa, the near and middle east as we believe were deficient of psychedelics, in stark contrast with central and south america.  Also, north america is deficient as well (abundant nicotine, tropanes).  In the middle east you had a couple things:  ephedra, syrian rue, cannabis, acacia, and poppy all xeriscape plants able to weather droughts.  That said, in india you had nutmeg and mushrooms, probably many other psychotrophic candidates such as spikenard, available to Europe via the silk road.</p>

<p>The only cosmospolitan (world wide, all regions) psychedelic is the amanita muscaria, which happens to be the mushroom purported by both Wasson and Allegro as the candidate for sacramentalhood.  McKenna believes Wasson was trying to throw people off the trail of psilocybin after he drummed up attention of hippies wanting to flood Oaxaca (again, keeping this among the elite only).  </p>

<p>To this day, northern asiatic shamanism continues to use the amanita muscaria as it is a dissociative psychedelic.  The interesting thing about it is that it 1) must be dried first, 2), that urine of the shaman is drunk by his clients as it contains the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanita_muscaria#Pharmacology">body-metabolized ibotenic acid into the active psychedlic subtance muscipol</a>.</p>

<p>So yes, urine and shit (coprophilic fungi) is again implicated in psychedelic use.  This is probably where the idea even came from originally.</p>

<p>Psilocybin mushrooms don&#39;t grow in the desert (middle east) or really commonly in america  (florida the exception, or up the west coast), as they are tropical and grow on fermented grass under cowshits... so they aren&#39;t a good candidate for soma, unless soma came from india originally, or from africa if / when it was a tropical forest (pre-climate change)</p>

<p>Also, I&#39;m not claiming that the alchemists were schizophrenics.  I&#39;m suggesting that perhaps they collected urine from people with these &#39;unusual&#39; or &#39;visionary&#39; or &#39;prophetic&#39; traits because--as alchemists commonly believed--the forces within us are concentrated in our fluids so if you collect them you can concentrate them.  According to that book of aquarius which I consider disinformation, btw, there is some truth around it generally, that alchemy was about &#39;speeding up natural processes&#39; and refining forces of nature.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This post and it&#39;s subsequent comments gave me a lot of food for thought. I&#39;d always forgotten the path that led me from waking up to government corruption.......somehow to......DMT.... McKenna and Watt ....and ibogaine and shamanism and .....ancient mystic practices..... this post summed things up well for me, especially my quandary in understanding the Freemasons. I could never hoard wonderful knowledge and freedom for myself, I&#39;d want to tell everyone! So, the fact they are so exclusive and secretive, operating all in occulted fashion, makes me disappointed and skeptical of them even before learning anything else about the organization. </p>

<p>My quest for the truth did lead me, after one year, right to DMT. Not using it, or any psychedelic (sadly? Yet?) but researching it. Watching hours of testimony from other psychonauts...reading and searching... listening to lectures by McKenna brothers and Alan and Timothy and so on...</p>

<p>......
 it&#39;s interesting that most people who wake up venture into the land of psychedelics in their quest for truth.</p>

Until then, I suppose, it&#39;s just meditation? Though I&#39;ve been doing that for some time and while it relaxes me and has helped with my pregnancy anxiety, I haven&#39;t felt anything near divine inspiration or the type of consciousness expansion I felt in 2012 when my mind naturally .....opened and I started thinking differently.

    <div class="md"><p>The Freemasons that were are not the Freemasons that are.</p>

<p>The elite do not use psychedelics, or they would be vastly kinder and smarter people.</p>

<p>Consider that there are other dimensions that are accessible to minds utilizing DMT, a kind of space-faring technology.
There are benevolent and malignant entities that inhabit those dimensions.  The malignant ones benefit from those who are braindead and sheep-like, and the elites are kept in this way, and become demonically possessed.  The suffering and horror feeds back into their dimension, and the objective is to keep the Earth in a state of Hell so that it may be dominated by a master/slave relationship so that Satan+family can have free reign of luxury and rape.</p>

<p>It&#39;s rather the solution to deliver psychedelics to the elite, in order to wake them up.  </p>

<p>DMT or psilocin is more likely the Holy Grail, the key that is within us, the magic elixir in the cup, that restores humanity and enlightenment.  It is our sacred journey to find and deliver the sacrament (psychedelics) to King Arthur (the elites) in order to restore Heaven on Earth.</p>

<p>Kidding aside, we <em>do</em> know that the elite used psychedelics at one time.  R Gordon Wasson and Huxley-- look into that.  Jan Irving of Gnostic Media podcast channel on youtube has made some impressive arguments that the CIA created the counterculture, and spoke with Peter Levenda on the subject as well</p>

<p>The only thing I&#39;d like to say here, is that your body produces DMT naturally and unlocking this process is the purest form of alchemy. Taking DMT externally to achieve spiritual transcendence actually a very dangerous process and is actually a perversion of the real kundalini.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is totally wrong and far from the truth.  Have you ever read any of the old ancient alchemy books?  It&#39;s  quite obviously to me that you haven&#39;t. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been leisurely studying alchemy for several years, and have read Manly P Hall&#39;s writings, and much older writings on alchemy such as The Last Will and Testament by Basil Valentine, which dates back to 1671.</p>

<p>In Basil Valentine&#39;s book he describes how he healed a fellow monk who was on his death bead, in three days. He also talks about the three main base elements which are inherent in man, that being mercury, sulfur, and salt.  This is doesn&#39;t sound like the writings of someone who was messing around with urine, or looking to have a psychedelic experience.</p>

<p>Basil Valentine also mentions the fiery phoenix, the mystical bird that dates back to the Egyptians, in my opinion this deals with transmutation, but he was not clear and most old alchemy texts are very illusive in their nature.</p>

<p>What about ORMUS, the Monatomic Elements? I good punch holes in your theories all day.  I&#39;m not saying I have all the answers, but what I can say without a doubt, is that your theories are not very accurate when looking at some of the older texts, and you have not researched this subject deep enough to give a holistic opinion.</p>

<p>True alchemy definitely deals with chemistry, transmutation, the periodic table of elements, and the art of alchemical healing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, sorry.  I know at least as much as you have about alchemy.  I have read many books, have listened to countless hours of Manly P Hall, Terence McKenna, old alchemy books and witchcraft books on librivox, countless hours of various videos on gaiam.tv.  It all goes back to this.  </p>

<p>If you read my thing and think that I&#39;m saying <em>all alchemy is a medieval drug lab</em> you got the wrong thing from my writing.  I was saying that they were making drugs to augment the process of their craft and to perform the psychological process.  They had to know what they were doing before making the plunge, so they had to study the process, meditate on it and then jump in with the fruits of their craft.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So there&#39;s the <em>study</em> and there&#39;s the <em>lab or practicum</em>, just like in modern college science.  The two things aren&#39;t mutually exclusive.  You can go through a jungian process in normal consciousness but you won&#39;t get very far.  As TM said, you can get to the same place on a heroic dose of mushrooms that would take a buddhist monk 20 yrs of sitting on his ass.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think the bubble you and some others are in, who give this idea I proposed a bad rap is that modern american culture is devoid of a shamanic tradition, by design.  So you assume that if I mention DMT I&#39;m talking about it strictly recreationally and not shamanically.  Again, because our shamanic roots are &#39;lost&#39;--I am positing they aren&#39;t lost but that freemasons have vanguarded this tradition but like the shitty elitistst priestcraft they claim to fight, they&#39;ve effected the same thing: to inhibit common man from access.</p>

<p>So you know what I&quot;m talking about, this lack of western shamanism is discussed at length by TMckenna, but he doesn&#39;t go specifically into <em>why or how</em> other than something like :  &quot;the government wants you drink coffee and have cigarettes so that you can be productive past 3pm...can you imagine how much work would be done if pot were legal?  Well there you go&quot;.  </p>

<p>But others have gone into it and it&#39;s this: &quot;you do acid for the first time and while you&#39;re listening to the radio you think to yourself, &#39;what is this crap they are trying to sell me?  They are lying--do you hear this?  They&#39;re trying to pull one over on us!&#39;+-.&quot; and &quot;it dissolves cultural programming&quot;  and &quot;it makes you question the government, organizations, institutions and culture&quot;   Oh they cannot have that!  So that&#39;s why psychedelics are illegal AND tabooo.  Specifically by religious institutions, making them &#39;extremely sinful&#39; and &#39;substances of devils&#39; and &#39;the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, given by the snake (satan)&#39;   In fact, it&#39;s all these things, except, strangely and by their own words we&#39;ve already eaten of the fruit so why would we stop?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are a few problems, here. Mostly you&#39;re leaping from point to point, but never firmly establishing that they&#39;re related.</p>

<p>You also drop this line:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Freemasons ... whose ranks form a large majority of most major political institutions worldwide</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is absurdly false. There aren&#39;t enough of us left to form a large majority of anything on that scale.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If it&#39;s so great, and if the Freemason as such pious, good-intentioned people, and their exlir so magical and perfecting, then shouldn&#39;t they then find a way to bring it back to the lumpen masses to help everyone &#39;perfect themselves&#39;? Why not turn everyone into gold?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m going to expand this beyond Freemasonry and talk about the Western initiatic traditions as a whole. The goal of initiation is two-fold: to give and to withhold. On the one hand, initiatic traditions preserve a bit of knowledge. In primitive societies, it might be how to hunt or other practical knowledge for everyday life. In modern societies (basically from the founding of cities on) initiation preserves knowledge of the internal; the self.</p>

<p>On the other hand, initiatic traditions withhold information from those who are not yet prepared to deal with it. This is why we don&#39;t teach toddlers to use band-saws; it&#39;s why we don&#39;t teach everyone how to perform open-heart surgery. Yes, these are incredibly useful tools, but if you&#39;re not ready to respect them, you can hurt yourself.</p>

<p>All such traditions ensure that their prospective candidates are prepared to look at themselves honestly and then they proceed to hold up a mirror.</p>

<p>Side point: the DMT/acacia link is tenuous at best. I never really bought it, but it&#39;s certainly possible that there was some ancient tradition that used the plant for its latent psychoactive properties. Still, to retroactively try to assert that as the reason for its allegorical significance is a pretty massive leap for which I&#39;d need much more evidence.</p>

<p>Nice job trying to gatekeep, but it won&#39;t work.  I know you freemasons are an international network with an astounding membership and brother, sister orgs like the FOP and the red hat society not to mention higher level orgs like royal arch masons and order knights of malta; which you clearly don&#39;t belong to, because you&#39;re engaging here on reddit.   And that&#39;s probably because they asked you to spit or pee on the cross, and as a good protestant or mormon you said &#39;no&#39; so they congratualted you and kept you at low levels.  </p>

<p>This network is integrated with all the financial elite and intelligence agencies all the way through. If you aren&#39;t specifcially trying to discredit this theory, then they&#39;ve duped you along with maybe 90% of the world into thinking they are a kind, loving, charitable organization (which they clearly are but not to the exclusion of other foul things they do like enable pedo cults in intelligence).</p>

<p>If I could only get an audience with a higher up, man what a conversation that would be.  On the one hand, I dont&#39; give a rats ass if you worship lucifer--that is your right as an american.  I do have a problem with sacrificing 3000  people in fire to jabulon.  So we need to put in end to this kind of thing posthaste.  Also you guys need stop selling heroin / drugs and find another way to make vast amounts of money that doesn&#39;t hurt people.  </p>

<p>Here&#39;s what I would say: Show people how good lucifer can be by ending the drug war, apologizing, getting people out of jail, giving them back their drugs and sovereign rights (ie: their individuality or luciferian aspects), end all the wars and make the world a garden.  Do those things, and I&#39;ll start worshiping lucifer too.  SO far the christians seem to have done nothing but create this big terrible mess of the world.</p>

<p>And how do you &quot;know&quot; this? Our raw numbers have been dropping since 1960. Our per capita numbers have been dropping since &#39;55.

<p>Dude book of aquarius is where I got the idea of pee from.  Then I verified DMT was eliminated in urine (along with over a hundred other things) from a deep chemical assay of human urine made by nasa.</p>

<p>other books on that site are helpful though, thanks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as why these substances are kept from us: with the unification of reality and imagination comes great power, a power that those that are subversive among us would use to cause great harm and only personal gain. It is unfortunate that some among the Freemasons have chosen to utilize that power in such a way.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t quite follow?</p>

<p>Ask any TRULY successful person how they did it: they followed their dreams, they used hard work, willpower, and determination to turn their imagination into reality. This is the secret that Freemasons guard. This is why Masons strive to teach men to become morally strong, respectable, and kind people- it is all in an attempt to prevent the abuse of this power.</p>

<p>But what do I know, I&#39;m just an extremely well read 24 year old who&#39;s chasing his own dreams and WILL make them his reality.</p>

<p>The thing is, you haven&#39;t made it yet. So indeed what do you know?
Most &quot;successful&quot; people became what they are because they don&#39;t have boundaries. they will kill if they have to, to achieve their goal. They take what they believe is already theirs.
And you and i won&#39;t get in their way.</p>

<p>Hard work, willpower, determination. Is what good people do, but they won&#39;t take what is really theirs. Since their too kind and still believe in society&#39;s values, morale right and wrongs  </p>

<p>But in all actuality being successful isn&#39;t that great. Just like the alpha male lion one day you&#39;re on top, next day you&#39;re in a ditch bleeding out, and no one gives a single shit about it.
Just like you, didn&#39;t give a single shit about them when they needed you the most,most likely didn&#39;t even know they needed you in the first place since all the focus was on &quot;ME&quot;
to busy chasing the perfect life and guarding you&#39;re turf. </p>

<p>I never seen an miracle fall on those who expect them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow you need to study the occult harder.  These books written by hippies on acid go back to at least 1400ad.   Before that even, although written in different languages than english at that point, so the ones that emerged in post medieval times are translations of those books.</p>

<p>Most recently Blavatsky condensed all occult knowledge this into her works which were widely adopted as theosophy, upon which the black occult german prehitler cult the SS formed.  By recently I mean late 1800s.  She influence Aleister Crowley who was half a century before hippies existed.</p>

 IMO, one of the greatest modern day examples of abracadabra was Bill Gates saying &quot; A computer on every desk&quot;  </p>

<p>The greatest modern day example of the alchemical transformation of lead into gold is the works of engineers at Texas Instruments, Intel,etc...  to turn the common earth element sand/silica into transistors and computer chips.<br/>
