    <div class="md"><p>If a populace is armed to the teeth with small arms, shotguns, semi-auto rifles, etc., the government would need to use weapons an order of magnitude greater. If a populace doesn&#39;t even have guns, the government can fairly effectively subdue the populace with small arms. Even if the government can absolutely overpower the people, there&#39;s a psychological component which I think is key to this. The unarmed populace will be less likely to even try to rise up. </p>

<p>I do agree with your last sentence though, that controlling perception and dehumanizing the populace is a major part of this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem to be under the impression that the ONLY reason these shootings make the news is because there is someone behind the curtains orchestrating a media frenzy for these particular events.</p>

<p>As it turns out, a mass shooting on a “soft target” is news because people want to hear about it. It’s news because it’s out of the ordinary. I’m sure shootings in gangland Chicago or Detroit (I’m Australian, I don’t know where the worst gun violence is) don’t make the news very often because it’s the norm. Mass shootings in populated areas aren’t the norm. People want to hear about these events when they happen, and that’s the media’s job.</p>

<p>I know there’s plenty wrong with the way mass media works in America and worldwide, but it still serves the purpose of bringing news to people. Throw all the conspiracy theories you want at them, they’re still doing a job that billions of people rely on to hear about what’s happening in the world. These events make news because they’re big events, not because the FBI or whatever are making them.</p>

<p>The smartest thing to do would be to shut up about mass shootings to prevent the spread of fear and the allure of being on the 6 o’clock news spreading the shooter’s message, but the news media has proved that views are more important than social good countless times. They’re a business.</p>
