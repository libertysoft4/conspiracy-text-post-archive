        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>If the US media is so far corrupted and corporate interest controlled in the name of radical statist beliefs and federal interests, let us try and piece together how the &quot;official&quot; narrative would like if it were the complete opposite of the lies the news and police are reporting. </p>

<h1>The opposite of the official narrative:</h1>

<p>So the scenario would play out like this: 14 police-types surround and abduct 2 people in their home, the man is strict, not a cuckold. The mercenaries drive the couple to a crime scene and it looks like they are chasing each-other&#39;s large black SUVs. Agents kill them , and then head into the Inland Regional center, and they hold a live drill where the crisis actor look like were killing 14 people in another crisis actor hoax, but really killed no one. This would be exactly the opposite story, right? Would give the 909 and Riverside/SB people a reason to tighten up on gun laws, more federal funding, and could lock in some new nation control policy while they are at it.  </p>

<h1>Oddities surrounding the San Bernardino &quot;mass shooting&quot;:</h1>

<ol>
<li>Highly trained and professional Lawyer risking his entire reputation and life saying it&#39;s a hoax <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2K2iAJUVo0">HERE</a><br/></li>
<li>Several witnesses that day saw 3 athletic white male <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-12-06/san-bernardino-attack-eye-witness-three-tall-white-men-did-it">HERE</a>. The &quot;lead&quot; shooter turns out to be a woman....<br/></li>
<li>The muslim families apartment is raided by 50 reporters not wearing clean suits, to muddy investigation<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3vg16p/journalists_storm_san_bernardino_shooters/?ref=search_posts">HERE</a></li>
<li>Death threats being issued from San Bernardino &quot;resident&quot; to independent journalists covering alternative.stories. REad the death threat sub <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3vtox8/little_psa_about_san_bernardino/?ref=search_posts">HERE</a><br/></li>
<li>A second eye witness saw white shooters in the regional center <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3vqgnr/second_eyewitness_testimony_of_san_bernardino/?ref=search_posts">HERE</a><br/></li>
<li>News of the shooters wearing GoPros™ has been removed from the news. GoPros are a tactical things troops and martial law types wear, so they have the footage to study or possible trophy <a href="http://carryingthegun.com/2014/06/13/can-a-soldier-wear-a-gopro-on-deployment/">Have a look</a><br/></li>
<li>There was a mega thread here in this sub where a guy reported and transcribed to all the scanners and basically created a vivid map of all the police chases happening around the down, and there were other people shooting around town as a distraction. This sounds high level planning.<br/></li>
<li> The guy in Redlands / San Bernardino who bought the young muslim couple the guns, just happens to have locked himself in a mental institution. Whether this is a witness protection thing, or he is really crazy, we probably will never find out.<br/></li>
<li>The news starts publishing this ridiculously absurd photo of the guy that sold the couple the guns <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/online/police-raid-home-of-san-bernardino-shooters-former-neighbor-who-bought-them-guns/">HERE</a> an impotent photo which basically convolutes and warps the guys face so no one will ever recognize this guy in a normal state. It&#39;s quite absurd and <a href="http://i.imgur.com/4WUfEkT.png">funny looking</a><br/></li>
<li>This one is a stretch, and funny side note, but I the only one that think the neighbor&#39;s name Farook really looks similar to the word Facebook like a misspelled Arab Facebook = Farook? Just seems like an odd wink or something indicating that this thing was planned out and had some winks in it.<br/></li>
<li>Cuckold gate trigger warning: News reports start to come out saying racist shit like &quot;Jihadi Bride&quot; influenced man to kill everyone. This seems to benefit the cuckold programming that is happening in sitcoms, news, music, and literature, making men more passive cuckolds that become bankrupt debt slaves chasing the ultimate cuckold dream. I know it&#39;s a stretch but could this be a part of the cuckold agenda just as much as it is a part of the gun control agenda?</li>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m still forming my own opinion on how these things may happen, and it seems like there are three likely general scenarios.</p>

<p>1) All deaths are faked and all involve crisis actors</p>

<p>2) Some deaths are real (killed by professional operators) and some deaths are fabricated using crisis actor families</p>

<p>3) All deaths are real (killed by professional operators) and only the official &quot;shooters&quot; are framed patsies.</p>

<p>Now, regarding this San Bernardino thing -</p>

<p>If scenario #1 were true, it seems unlikely that three, military type men would be needed to carry out a mock shooting. If the entire thing were a performance, then why not use a man and woman who look like the patsies?</p>

<p>If scenario #3 were true, then why do we get these strange &quot;victim&quot; interviews that appear (badly) acted?</p>

<p>This leaves scenario #2. Perhaps real people are killed to the lay some groundwork of real devastation and create a blood trail of sorts.  Then when dealing with media, the actors or managed assets are trotted out to get the right sound bites and spin out into the air.</p>

<p>In any case, it&#39;s all very strange.</p>

<p>Btw, good point about contaminating the apartment crime scene.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>She&#39;s the only &quot;real&quot; death I&#39;ve heard about yet, and I&#39;m a local. Interesting. I personally think this event is part of the agenda to divide California into multiple states (which, as I recall, already made enough signatures to go to a vote in 2016). Two locals who can only account for one death, and I don&#39;t know anyone who knows anyone who knew any of the others allegedly killed. Odd...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m just speaking theoretically, with no dispresect to any deceased, but it&#39;s not that your coworkers would be making it up. The health inspector&#39;s death could have been staged as part of a shocking incident with the purpose of creating psychological and political impact.</p>

<p>In reality, the health inspector could have been an implanted operative of some sort who will relocate and take on another assignment in another part of the country or world. Basically, he works as a health inspector for a &quot;day job&quot; while collecting a CIA payroll as well. When needed, his death is faked, and he disappears from the community.</p>

<p>But anyway, like I said, theoretical. None of us have enough information to say otherwise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The following video is an absolutely brilliant discussion from a clinician who explains why the staged or hoax model is used rather than real events. This is a must-listen for anybody interested in understanding this topic. </p>

<p>Almost all criminals tend to start with the “Poor Me, I’m a Victim” meme as cover for their evil or criminality. Ownership of victim-hood is a powerful franchise to be used to attack and suppress targeted groups and critics.</p>

<p>Real people and real events “go off the tracks.” Real victims don’t follow scripts, can’t be controlled and get to be problems for the Crime Syndicate. The first truthers from 9/11 were real families of real victims.</p>

<p>They may mixed in some real killings for effect, but hoaxes predominate.

<p>P.S. this is an open forum for the discussion of conspiracy related events. Telling a participant to &quot;drop it&quot; is not in the play book. I raised a valid question, and have now posted proof. You could have looked it up yourself rather than calling me out. Enjoy the video, it happened four times.</p>

<p>If this was planned, it was done with care, and strategy, and done with a multi angle approach to confuse, and to optimize the messaging. The cuckold thing is a real thing right now, and it just stuck out to me they are making the wife a last-action-hero character with a cuc husband as her cohort. </p>

<p>Did you read the main theory? There are 11 points, 10 of them aren&#39;t cuc so I assure you this is not a distraction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I agree there are some oddities and discrepancies btwn first hand accounts and the current media story...all of which have been discussed in other posts so I don&#39;t really see anything new here...besides your own personal &quot;cuck narrative&quot; and the fact that apparently &quot;Farook&quot; looks like a &quot; misspelled Arab Facebook.&quot;</p>

<p>Top notch detective work! </p>

<p>I really hope you are trolling. If there was ANY legitimacy to your first 9 bullet points, you pretty much threw that out the window when you got to number 10.</p>

<p>My advice to you would be to spend less time on /pol/ and more time in /reallife/.</p>
