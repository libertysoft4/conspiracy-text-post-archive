        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>My alt account which I had been using, <a href="/u/Freedom-Seeker">/u/Freedom-Seeker</a> was hacked the night of the San Bernardino shooting (hoax) after I made some pretty controversial, and popular comments and posts.</p>

<p>It clearly shows that I was having a big effect IMO.  My question is who hacked my account, and why?</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t put an email address in, so after the password was changed, I was unable to reset it or change the password.  I was still logged in on one device, and was able to comment for a time, but then that device was logged out of after I contacted the admins and informed them of the breach (they never responded to me also).</p>

With a single admin working as a mole, they gain access to account details that identify the poster, private messages, as well as the ability to pull off influence operations by shadow banning people.</p>

<p>One founder aaron schwartz argued against the buyout. He went on to continue to try to reveal massive pharamceutical corruption through the medical journal study publishing racket.  Now that guy is famously dead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey man...as the main person you were going back and forth with in that thread I must say, I am sorry to hear that your account got &quot;hacked&quot; or something happened to your password, but I also think that those downvotes that you are so proud of are in fact real people, like myself, who legitimately believe the things you were posting are mind-numbingly stupid and do not help progress intelligent rational discussions in this subreddit.</p>

<p>You were literally praising and promoting YouTube videos that are <em>absolute garbage.</em> Videos that were being made and posted before the shooting/chase/manhunt/whatever you want to call it was even <em>finished.</em>  Somehow the fact that 81 morons with access to the internet and the wherewithal to register for a YouTube account are supposed to be some sort of beacon of hope for free-thinking?  Give me a break.  </p>

<p>I am very glad to have seen the amount of people who agreed with me that this is the very kind of thing that HURTS this conspiracy community. </p>

<p>There needs to be more rational thinking and analyzation of real evidence before people start shouting &quot;FALSE FLAG!&quot; and &quot;HOAX!&quot; </p>

<p>There needs to be less promotion of videos that <em>expose the NWO&#39;s satanic agenda with mind-blowing proof because THAT GUY OVER THERE HAS A HAT WITH A FREEMASON SYMBOL ON IT!!!!!!!!!</em> </p>

<p>I would ask anybody in this current thread reading this to actually go and read what <a href="/u/Freedom-Seeker">/u/Freedom-Seeker</a> was actually saying.</p>

<p>There is <em>CERTAINLY</em> nothing in there that would warrant some sort of conspiratorial Reddit inside-job downvote brigade to <em>hide the truth</em> found within your comments. Let&#39;s be real.  There was nothing of substance in any of your comments...so I don&#39;t think you have anything to worry about.</p>

<p>As I ended our last back-and-forth, I would like to say once again that your comments/posts display a <em>very high</em> level of paranoia. Might be time to take a break from the conspiracy forums for a bit and try to enjoy life a bit more. And I swear that I offer that advice with all of the best intentions....buuuuuut, based off of your previous responses, I imagine you will probably think that is some way of trying to <em>silence the truths</em> you are putting out there....so I&#39;m not even sure why I bothered typing all of this out.</p>

<p>Anyway, good luck in life. There is a lot more out there than watching shit YouTube videos that make Alex Jones productions look like works of Steven Spielberg. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Huh. Thanks for answering, admittedly I could have checked myself but was on toddler duty. </p>

<p>Interesting case. Sounds like it wasn&#39;t hacked to much as seized by reddit staff. I&#39;ll keep an eye on this - I&#39;m wondering if they&#39;ll see this thread and block this account too :-/</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Last year, the password to my my first account, <a href="/u/badbiosvictim">/u/badbiosvictim</a> , was changed. I had given an email address during account setup. All the temporty passwords that reddit emailed did not work. Error message was that they timed out. Several times, I asked the admins for help. No response. </p>

<p>Subsequently, the hacker changed my email address to circumvent reddit from sending more passwords. I asked the admins to reset my password. No response.</p>

<p>I could not respond to redditors commenting to my posts and PM me. I could no longer edit my posts to update them. </p>

<p>I was forced to create a second account. Reddit&#39;s accused me of creating a second account to bypass my negative comment karma and to confuse redditors into thinking I am a different user.</p>

<p>lol...If that is really the case, and I pissed someone off that badly, it should be a huge red flag to any critical thinker that can actually digest information and decide for themselves the truth.</p>

<p>The fact that I was hacked for saying these things should just give substance and meaning to what I said.  They wouldn&#39;t hack my account and lock me out of it of it if I wasn&#39;t making a difference.</p>
