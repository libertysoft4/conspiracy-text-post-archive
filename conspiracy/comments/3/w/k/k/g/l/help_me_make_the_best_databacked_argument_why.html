        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi guys, first time posting here. Let me know if I am doing something wrong. So, I am into conspiracies. I will admit that I am initially very open-minded, and even interested in ideas that seem crack-pot-ish. I like when some of them turn out to be true, but obviously false information and arguments must die. Regardless of how you came to this sub, we are a minority. Most people&#39;s reaction to a suggestion that powerful interests may be conspiring to screw someone because of incentives to do so are frequently met with strong skepticism at best, personal attacks at the worst.</p>

<p>So, I posted this link: <a href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2014/06/20/complete-history-monsanto-worlds-evil-corporation/">http://www.wakingtimes.com/2014/06/20/complete-history-monsanto-worlds-evil-corporation/</a> on a different sub (please remember Reddit&#39;s rules for following into a different sub)</p>

<p>and got this challenge:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This and similar articles have been recycling these false claims for years. It is a menu of the 1000x debunked claims by anti-GMO / anti-science activists. <strong>Just pick what you think is the best one and we will examine it.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I want to be prepared. I want to know my stuff before a debate. I have been not careful / wrong before, and even though &quot;fallacy fallacy&quot; (failure to argue well is not the same as being wrong) is technically a fallacy (lol), first impressions matter quite a bit.</p>

<p>To me personally it seems pretty obvious that Monsanto would pollute food, soil and science for its own gain. I would like to have water-tight verifiable data, facts that I can use to convince others.</p>

<p>Could you help? Thanks.</p>

<p>Would not that be nice? That is not how a human mind works.</p>

<p>Everybody is biased. I am just more open about it. I have a preference for non-mainstream ideas. Others are in reverse. I believe that it is better to be safe than sorry (it is darn difficult to demonstrate that something is &quot;safe&quot;). Several countries banned GMOs. Monsanto&#39;s past is apparently (if that article is to be trusted) very murky.</p>

<p>Not all issues are black and white. There are different degrees of belief associated with different hypothesis. When the rules of the debate and the scientific methods are followed, the truth will eventually come out. Informed and thorough fanatics on either side could actually be helpful in trying to test / break / defend a theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably late to the shindig but, I&#39;d say to: Make sure you have a very clear main argument, like a thesis, that puts all of your arguments into one nutshell. Refer to this nutshell a lot. Make your own original arguments, but use the other sources, data, info, etc. as evidence to back you up. Don&#39;t rely on the evidence to build your claims or argue for you, let the evidence be your support. Like others are saying, relying only on personal feelings is ill-advised. If anything, use the feely-feels along with all three: logos, pathos, ethos. Make claims that appeal to logic, claims that appeal to feelings, and claims that appeal to your or the evidence&#39;s credibility. Always consider the opposing viewpoints. That is probably most important. Be so well-versed in the opposition that you can easily shoot-down those viewpoints before they have enough time to simmer. Good luck :)</p>

Show them the light and let them go.
They allow no independent studies using their copyrighted seed and all studies are funded by them. 
They might be safe or not.
Without independent peer reviewed science that can be be replicated, I have no cause to believe they are. 
Also the chemicals they need to grow has been proven to create bigger stronger weeds, so, 
I guess if you trust that gmo food producers wouldn&#39;t be as corrupt as corporations say like Enron were, well, that would be where choice comes in.
The fact that they are so strongly against labeling their fine products, instead of insisting due to their foods obvious benefits tells me they want to keep us from knowing what we are eating and how it is grown. </p>

<p><strong>The Royal Society of Medicine</strong>: ”Foods derived from GM crops have been consumed by hundreds of millions of people across the world for more than 15 years, with no reported ill effects (or legal cases related to human health), despite many of the consumers coming from that most litigious of countries, the USA.” (http://1 usa gov/12huL7Z)</p>

<p><strong>The European Commission</strong>: ”The main conclusion to be drawn from the efforts of more than 130 research projects, covering a period of more than 25 years of research, and involving more than 500 independent research groups, is that biotechnology, and in particular GMOs, are no more risky than e.g. conventional plant breeding technologies.” (http://bit ly/133BoZW)</p>

<p><strong>American Medical Association</strong>: ”There is no scientific justification for special labeling of genetically modified foods. Bioengineered foods have been consumed for close to 20 years, and during that time, no overt consequences on human health have been reported and/or substantiated in the peer-reviewed literature.” (bit ly/1u6fHay)</p>

<p>Can you specifically show me the parts of my post that they &quot;disagree&quot; with, because you&#39;re just posting fucking nonsense. Your first extract in fact confirms that what I just said is correct. We have been using GM for less than a generation and therefore we haven&#39;t been physically able to research its effects over the course of even one lifetime.</p>

<p><strong>I retired 10 years ago after a long career as a research scientist for Agriculture Canada. When I was on the payroll, I was the designated scientist of my institute to address public groups and reassure them that genetically engineered crops and foods were safe. There is, however, a growing body of scientific research – done mostly in Europe, Russia, and other countries – showing that diets containing engineered corn or soya cause serious health problems in laboratory mice and rats.</strong></p>

<p>Let&#39;s ignore the fact that I&#39;ve posted dozens of quotes from massive scientific agencies. Okay.</p>

<p>I suggest you look into what Dr. Vrain has to say. He cites Seralini - who, if you&#39;re unfamiliar with the infamous story, is a fraud and has had his research retracted. Seralini forces journalists to sign contracts preventing them from speaking to other scientists; Seralini fraudulently manipulates data; he ignores regulatory standards; and he&#39;s funded by organic firms (via CRIIGEN/ENSSER). Seralini writes books on anti-GMO rhetoric, he is the definition of anti-science woo. Vrain cites other anti-science quacks like Rowett and Seneff (who believes vaccines cause autism); he rejects the mainstream papers and instead supports papers that have been dismissed by the academic community as deeply flawed. </p>

<p><a href="http://wiki.skeptiforum.org/wiki/Thierry_Vrain">You can read more about Thierry Vrain here</a> or check out <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/GMOSF/permalink/345803832225540/">this facebook comment thread on GMO Skepti-Forum about him</a>. There is a lot of data to talk about. If you have any specific concerns, I am happy to address those individually. <strong>Literally every single study Dr. Vrain cites is bunk.</strong> He only refers to papers by fringe scientists funded by organic firms.</p>

<p>What you are ignoring is that the Russian and European scientists do not agree with your &quot;scientific statements&quot;.

<p>Do you perhaps need a short course in the meaning of English?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you really have to get caught up in the semantics? Here, I&#39;ve added emphasis to some quotes:</p>

<p><em>American Council on Science and Health</em>: ”The consensus of scientific opinion is that the application of <strong>genetic modification technology introduces no unique food safety or environmental impact concerns</strong> and that there is no evidence of harm fromthose products that have been through a regulatory approval process.&quot; (http://bit ly/1sBCrgF)</p>

<p><em>American Society for Microbiology</em>: ”The ASM is <strong>not aware of any acceptable evidence that food produced with biotechnology and subject to FDA oversight constitutes high risk or is unsafe</strong>. We are sufficiently convinced to assure the public that plant varieties and products created with biotechnology have the potential of improved nutrition, better taste and longer shelf-life.” (http://bit ly/13Cl2ak)</p>

<p><em>International Seed Federation</em>: ”The development of GM crops has benefited farmers, consumers and the environment… Today, data shows that** GM crops and foods are as safe as their conventional counterparts**: millions of hectares worldwide have been cultivated with GM crops and billions of people have eaten GM foods without any documented harmful effect on human health or the environment.” (http://bit ly/138rZLW)</p>

<p><em>Society of Toxicology</em>: ”Scientific analysis indicates that the process of <strong>GM food production is unlikely to lead to hazards of a different nature</strong> than those already familiar to toxicologists. The level of safety of current GM foods to consumers appears to be equivalent to that of traditional foods.” (http://bit ly/13bOaSt)</p>

<p><em>Council for Agricultural Science and Technology</em>: ”Over the last decade, 8.5 million farmers have grown transgenic varieties of crops on more than 1 billion acres of farmland in 17 countries. These crops have been consumed by humans and animals in most countries. <strong>Transgenic crops on the market today are as safe to eat as their conventional counterparts</strong>, and likely more so given the greater regulatory scrutiny to which they are exposed.” (http://bit ly/11cTKq9)</p>

<p><em>Union of German Academies of Sciences and Humanities</em>: ”Food derived from <strong>GM plants approved in the EU and the US poses no risks greater than those from the corresponding conventional food</strong>. On the contrary, in some cases food from GM plants appears to be superior with respect to health.” (http://bit ly/17ClMMF)</p>

<p><em>Society for In Vitro Biology</em>: ”The SIVB supports the current science-based approach for the evaluation and regulation of genetically engineered crops. The SIVB supports the need for easy public access to available information on the safety of genetically modified crop products. In addition, the SIVB feels that foods from <strong>genetically modified crops, which are determined to be substantially equivalent to those made from crops</strong>, do not require mandatory labeling.” (http://bit ly/18yFDxo)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/gmolol/scientific-consensus-of-gmos/319215948218392?hc_location=ufi">More quotes can be found here</a>. The fact of the matter is, GE crops pose no additional risks - <em>and they are studied more thoroughly, so risks are reduced even further</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Escalation of signs of liver and kidney toxicity found in Monsanto 90-day feeding trial</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://gmoseralini.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/GES-final-study-19.9.121.pdf">http://gmoseralini.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/GES-final-study-19.9.121.pdf</a></p>

<p><strong>A groundbreaking new study [1] shows that pigs were harmed by the consumption of feed containing genetically modified (GM) crops.</strong></p>

<p><strong>GM-fed females had on average a 25% heavier uterus than non-GM-fed females, a possible indicator of disease that requires further investigation. Also, the level of severe inflammation in stomachs was markedly higher in pigs fed on the GM diet. The research results were striking and statistically significant.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Lead researcher Dr. Judy Carman, adjunct associate professor at Flinders University, Adelaide, Australia,[2] said: “Our findings are noteworthy for several reasons. First, we found these results in real on-farm conditions, not in a laboratory, but with the added benefit of strict scientific controls that are not normally present on farms.</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://gmojudycarman.org/new-study-shows-that-animals-are-seriously-harmed-by-gm-feed/">http://gmojudycarman.org/new-study-shows-that-animals-are-seriously-harmed-by-gm-feed/</a></p>

<p><strong>These results confirm that G formulations  have adjuvants working together with the active ingredient and causing toxic effects that are not seen with acid glyphosate</strong></p>

<p><strong>This study rejects that GM soy is “substantially equivalent” to non-GM soybeans</strong></p>

<p><strong>We argue that the practice of “ripening” sugar cane with glyphosate may explain the recent surge in kidney failure among agricultural workers in Central America. We conclude with a plea to governments to reconsider policies regarding the safety of glyphosate residues in foods.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Glyphosate’s Suppression of Cytochrome P450 Enzymes and Amino Acid Biosynthesis by the Gut Microbiome: Pathways to Modern Diseases</strong></p>

<p><strong>Glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup®, is the most popular herbicide used worldwide. The industry asserts it is minimally toxic to humans, but here we argue otherwise.</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/15/4/1416">http://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/15/4/1416</a></p>

<p><strong>The cytotoxic effects of glyphosate were also evident, as observed by signiﬁcant decrease in mitotic (cell division) index (MI). The present results indicate that glyphosate is clastogenic 1 and cytotoxic 2 to mouse bone marrow.</strong></p>

<p>Would not that be nice? That is not how a human mind works.</p>

<p>Everybody is biased. I am just more open about it. I have a preference for non-mainstream ideas. Others are in reverse.

<p>Not all issues are black and white. There are different degrees of belief associated with different hypothesis.
