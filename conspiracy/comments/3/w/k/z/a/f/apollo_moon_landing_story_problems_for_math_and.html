    <div class="md"><p>This is kind of a kindergarten approach to physics, especially the fixation on Lagrange points and the weird idea that you&#39;d need to fire engines the entire way there. It&#39;s like this is based on a worldview that nixes the laws of motion, the rocket equation, and basic math. (Not to mention the nature of orbiting and probably the shape of the planet.)</p>

<p>I&#39;ll toss this one in, though:</p>

<p>The Saturn V launch and the lunar lander can&#39;t really be compared in scale. Not even close.</p>

<p>The former had to launch the lander and orbiter through the atmosphere with the fuel required for the Moon visit - and then it had to carry all the fuel required to lift its own upper stages too. At launch it weight something like 6.5 million lbs and it had to reach a speed of 17,500 mph while countering drag and high gravity.</p>

<p>The lander, meanwhile, required only enough to launch a small lander from an airless surface that&#39;s got a fraction of the gravity, and accelerate it to about 3,700 mph. There are orders of magnitudes difference here, it&#39;s not a matter of dividing by 6. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you go faster than Earth&#39;s escape velocity, you&#39;re off to the races. Although technically you are never completely out of the pull of gravity of anything, the numbers are so negligible that it makes no difference. About 25,000 miles per hour is enough to leave Earth forever - doable, considering you&#39;re already at a significant fraction of that just orbiting. LEO is halfway to anywhere...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Moon&#39;s gravity is pretty tiny actually, hence why things aren&#39;t meaningfully lighter when the Moon is in the sky. Tidal forces are a bit more complicated than that, being more a cumulative effect due to the tendency for water to flow downhill rather than just literally getting pulled upwards by the Moon. I mean, that logic wouldn&#39;t explain why there&#39;s also a bulge on the opposite side of the Earth...</p>

<p>By the way, the Earth&#39;s gravity still affects a rocket to the Moon plenty. It orbits the Earth, right? That orbit is the effect of gravity - without gravity, objects would just keep going straight. All those bendy paths you see are due to the effects of good old gravity. :)</p>

<p>can you elaborate on this concept of &quot;escape velocity&quot;? it seems one could argue that a bird achieves &quot;escape velocity&quot; because it can fly. why would escape velocity be different for a bird than for a bullet or a rocket? what is so magical about 25,000MPH?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Birds don&#39;t escape the Earth, sorry to say. I wish our avian friends the best of luck, though! ;)</p>

<p>Escape velocity is the minimum speed required in order to break free of the gravitational attraction of a body, generally a big one like a Planet or Moon where the mass starts adding up. For Earth, that velocity is about 25000 mph; if you go slower, you&#39;re not getting out. Note that orbiting objects like the ISS, space shuttles, satellites, Moon landers, the Moon itself etc. aren&#39;t escaping the Earth&#39;s gravitational influence - they&#39;re all well within it. </p>

<p>Meanwhile probes to Mars or the outer planets, or straight out of the solar system, are moving at a rather faster clip and necessarily had to surpass escape velocity to do so. </p>

<p>can you tell us exactly where a rocket has to be when it is traveling at 25,000 to achieve &quot;escape&quot; velocity?</p>

<p>would that be 25,000MPH at the surface of the earth, or 25,000MPH as rocket leaves earth orbit and heads toward lagrange point? </p>

<p>lets face it. you will never go to the moon, and you will never meet anyone who will go to the moon. </p>

<p>its really not that hard to figure out, but you were brainwashed at such a young age that this absurd bullshit got programmed into your mind before you developed any critical thinking skills. kinda like how some people believed in santa claus.</p>

<p>now that you are an adult, you can go back and revisit these absurd ideas and apply critical thinking skills. </p>

<p>for example, if we ask why nobody from Russia, China, England, or France has ever walked on the moon, one simple answer may be that Russia, China, England,and France do not have the technology to go to the moon. </p>

<p>and thats the exact same reason that nobody from USA has ever walked on the moon. </p>

<p>You have been provided direct refutations. You&#39;re just unwilling to accept the explanations provided and continually demand additional evidence.

<p>My proposition is not a superficially similar proposition that would justify it being called a strawman. </p>

<p>My proposition is exactly like your proposition - you are claiming that no matter how much energy a rocket uses, it should not be able to escape earth&#39;s gravity.

<p>“It is commonly believed that man will fly directly from the earth to the moon, but to do this, we would require a vehicle of such gigantic proportions that it would prove an economic impossibility. It would have to develop sufficient speed to penetrate the atmosphere and overcome the earth’s gravity and, having traveled all the way to the moon, it must still have enough fuel to land safely and make the return trip to earth. Furthermore, in order to give the expedition a margin of safety, we would not use one ship alone, but a minimum of three … each rocket ship would be taller than New York’s Empire State Building [almost ¼ mile high] and weigh about ten times the tonnage of the Queen Mary, or some 800,000 tons.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a quote which deals with the scenario of a single stage monster rocket which takes off from Earth, flies directly to the Moon, and lands there before doing the same thing in reverse. Such a scenario would, indeed, be rather absurd.

<p>The actual moon landings weren&#39;t even a little bit like that scenario, of course. (Beyond using some big rockets.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You realize that it&#39;s Apollo <em>11</em> for a reason, right? Not to mention the Mercury and Gemini programs that preceded the Apollo program. All the various parts involved were tested on Earth, in LEO, at the Moon, and ultimate applied to the first Moon landing.</p>

<p>Besides that, of course, you can calculate the exact requirements for the launch and landing with math, including the precise amount of fuel needed for all the various stages. This is why Armstrong knew, to the second, how long he had to land the Eagle, before the mission would be aborted. It was pretty close on that first one.</p>

<p>In the above pictures of flags, let your eye follow from the flagpole to along the bottom edge of the flag. note how the edge bends slightly upward, then down, 
then gets rough/jagged near the the end.</p>

<p>let your eye follow turn the corner and follow the vertical edge upward. note the triangle shaped &quot;tit&quot; sticking out. note that the edge smooths out at the 
4th red stripe from the top, then kicks outward a little at the very top. </p>

<p>let your eye find the star closest to the center of the flag. note that star, along with 2 directly above it, are in a shadow. note that the shadow in both flags is 
identical, and covers the exact same stars in both pics. notice how the shadow continues onto the white strip below, with the same jagged contour. </p>

<p>looks like the numbers 74, 75, 78, 80, 81, 86 were used, and </p>

<p>looks like the numbers 76, 77, 79, 82, 83, 84, 85 are missing </p>

<p>so, we now know that NASA is not showing all of the photos in this series. i wonder why that would be? something to hide? surely even a &quot;bad&quot; photo taken on the moon is worth something to someone.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry if i find your explanation implausible. I don&#39;t think the shadows on the blue field on the flag would look the same taken from different sides of the flag at different times. never mind the fact that this flag is somehow &quot;waving&quot; in spite of no wind on the moon. yes, i see the horizontal part of the flagpole that supports the top of the flag. I&#39;m talking about the rest of the flag, which should be hanging more or less straight down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh for gods sake. We haven&#39;t been back and don&#39;t go back because of one simple reason. There&#39;s fuck all to do on the moon. It&#39;s entirely composed of elements found here on earth, due to it actually being a part of the earth. It&#39;s a dead rock in space, with far less gravity and no way for life to form. Frankly, I&#39;m surprised we went as many times as we did. It costs more than the GDP of many, many nations to get to the moon, and currently there is absolutely no gain from going there, as the US learned anything worth learning on it&#39;s trips.</p>

<p>Yea, I know that quote. Only ever saw it on idiotic conspiracy websites. Funny thing is that those same people quoting it don&#39;t realize that it&#39;s almost a proof for the space program.

    <div class="md"><p>If you launched it straight up (and weren&#39;t going for an orbit) then at 25,000 mph or so, it would keep going up, asymptotically losing speed until it almost stops (barring other gravitational fields.) If it&#39;s lower than the escape velocity it falls back, if it&#39;s faster then it&#39;ll just keep moving away. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s actually feasible to do this perfectly - gravitational effects would turn a straight shot into an eccentric orbit and unless one part of it dips into the atmosphere, that orbit could remain for a long, long time. </p>

<p>In reality, of course, you don&#39;t generally launch straight shots - you use orbital mechanics to get from place to place more efficiently. You could use 25000 mph to orbit at the very edge of the Earth-Moon system, about three times as far away as the Moon is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The 25000MPH figure is from the surface of earth. If I were on an idealized uniform mass version of earth with no atmosphere, and I were accelerated to 25000MPH away from the center, I would achieve escape velocity. As I travelled &quot;up,&quot; the force of the earth&#39;s gravity on my body would provide a negative acceleration, slowing me down. I would continue to slow down indefinitely, but I would slow down less and less as the earth&#39;s gravity had less and less effect. </p>

<p>Eventually, the force of the earth&#39;s gravity would be negligible. If my initial velocity were slightly less than escape velocity, I would eventually stop moving, and then start accelerating back toward earth. If it were slightly more, I would continue moving at roughly the magnitude of the velocity greater than escape velocity. If I were exactly at escape velocity, my velocity would continue to decrease as I approached infinite distance from the earth. </p>

<p>If I already start at a point above sea level, such as the Saturn V after it&#39;s left the atmosphere, the escape velocity is much smaller. You can basically plug your distance from the center of the earth into <a href="/u/Roarian">/u/Roarian</a>&#39;s equation to find your new escape velocity from that point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t have to directly fight gravity to get to the moon. Rockets don&#39;t travel on a straight path to the moon. They launch to orbit, which is a circular path around the earth. Getting to orbit is the hard part, as drag from the atmosphere is pretty severe. It takes significantly less thrust to alter the shape of your orbit. Once the shape of your orbit is changed so that you enter the sphere of influence of the moon&#39;s gravity, you can fire engines and slow down to begin orbiting the moon.</p>

<p>1) Considering the gravity of Earth, in which relative direction would you say the Moon is to Earth? Up, Down, or Neither (Flat) ?</p>

<p>A) Up</p>

<p>now, you might claim that the path taken by a rocket was not 90 degrees straight up, which would make the path more like an inclined plane. however, taking the path of an inclined plane means they would have to travel farther than a straight line distance of 200,000 miles, which has already been shown to be an absurd claim. </p>

<p>3) Considering Law of Conservation of Energy, where would you expect rocket obtain energy required to increase the gravitational potential energy of the rocket?</p>

<p>4) Would you expect to need to continuously use fuel in exchange for continuously increased gravitational potential energy of rocket all the way to Lagrange Point?</p>

<p>A) yes</p>

<hr/>

<p>No. </p>

<p>If you fired the engines all the way up there you&#39;d be going too fast and overshoot the moon. Plus you&#39;d run out of fuel. </p>

<p>Read the Apollo 11 flight plan and you&#39;ll see they made multiple burns lasting between a few seconds to up to 11 minutes. All added up it it&#39;s about half an hour of total burn time. </p>

If you&#39;re not actually trying to start a colony on the moon, it doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense to spend the extra money, as well as risk the lives of humans, to do something robots can do just as easily with less payload.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Earth&#39;s gravity exists in all directions though, so by necessity it&#39;s simultaneously &#39;up&#39; from one side of the Earth and &#39;down&#39; from the other, and everything in between, even if we took down to be the center of the Earth. Not sure what relevance this has...?</p>

<p>If you are in an orbit, say 1000 kilometers above the Earth, then you will remain there - it&#39;s stable. Unless some outside force acts on you (aka not the Earth&#39;s gravity) then you will remain in that 1000 kilometer orbit for a very, very long time - forever, if earth&#39;s gravity was perfectly even. The reason why satellites have some fuel on board (though not much) is to counteract some of the smaller perturbations that happen because of other sources of gravity like the Moon or unevenness of the Earth. </p>

<p>The same thing holds for 2000 km, and 5000, and 384000. If you go fast enough you can visit all of these without worrying that you&#39;re mysteriously and suddenly going to be yanked back by gravity - that force is what even allows this to begin with. The further away you go, the less effect the Earth&#39;s gravity will have - until eventually you escape altogether. </p>

<p>because the rocket will be increasing its gravitational potential energy all the way from earth to a lagrange point, and this continuously increasing potential energy must come from continuously consuming fuel. even if you reached 25,000 MPH you still won&#39;t coast uphill for another 100,000 miles. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP, you have a physics fail. You don&#39;t understand how a rocket trades kinetic energy for potential energy as it travels through a gravity field.</p>

<p>Look at it this way: at the L1 point, gravity is balanced between the moon and Earth. If a rocket starts at this point and falls to Earth, it will accelerate to achieve a certain velocity by the time it reaches Earth.  Conversely, if the rocket starts with this velocity from Earth, it will coast all the way to L1. Any velocity greater, and the rocket will coast past L1 and accelerate as it gets closer to the moon. This is the point you don&#39;t get.</p>

<p>presumably its easier to try and silence someone than it is to debate, because the debate certainly wasn&#39;t going their way, and it never will. so i invited a few people onto this thread to continue the discussion of the evidence for and against the Apollo manned missions to the Moon.</p>

<p>extra karma points for anyone who uses derivatives of phrases such as:</p>

<p>&quot;OP obviously doesn&#39;t understand orbital mechanics&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;why didn&#39;t those ever-vigilant Russians alert me to this fraud?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;what about the moon rocks?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;what about the reflector on the moon?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;where do you think the rocket was going?&quot;</p>

<p>They placed a reflective surface on the moon when they landed. Now using lasers they&#39;re able to measure the rate at which the moon is moving away from the earth. NASA isn&#39;t the only organization able to verify this claim.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>if you really understood science, would you still believe that men walked on the moon, 
and that vaccines are safe, effective, and necessary?</p>

<p>lets face it. you will never go to the moon, and you will never meet anyone who will go to the moon. </p>

<p>its really not that hard to figure out, but you were brainwashed at such a young age that this absurd bullshit got programmed into your mind before you developed any critical thinking skills. kinda like how some people believed in santa claus.</p>

<p>now that you are an adult, you can go back and revisit these absurd ideas and apply critical thinking skills. </p>

<p>for example, if we ask why nobody from Russia, China, England, or France has ever walked on the moon, one simple answer may be that Russia, China, England,and France do not have the technology to go to the moon. </p>

<p>and thats the exact same reason that nobody from USA has ever walked on the moon. </p>

<p>24 questions is dumbed down for idiots like you. unfortunately not even that can help everyone. </p>
