        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am a veteran user of compasses.  Not only am I an Eagle Scout, and Army Veteran, but I have much experience doing navigation for sailboats and motorboats on charts.  Especially for sailboat racing, an accurate compass heading is very important.  </p>

<p>Here is the video that I made on the subject:<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNQKfoiLNv8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNQKfoiLNv8</a></p>

<p>My knowledge of how compasses work clashes with the claims of how our Earth is magnetized.  My claims come from the case that compasses are VERY sensitive equipment.  If the compass is not flat, it can &quot;bind&quot; and will not show the correct heading.  For this reason, it is important to hold your compasses flat.  There are marine and aeronautical compasses that are gyroscopic, but what I am discussing is mainly the handheld magnetic compasses.  </p>

<p>The compass points twoards the Northern magnetic field.  If this magnetism was from the spinning core, wouldn&#39;t the compass point down into the ground?  If the magnetism is from the north pole (on a globe), wouldn&#39;t the compass point slightly into the ground (depending on your location?).  If the magnetism is from the magnetosphere, wouldn&#39;t the compass be attracted up into the air?  </p>

<p>So my questions come from my belief that there is discrepancy in how compasses work and what &quot;they&quot; say the shape of the Earth is.  I believe this is just another clue of the lies that they have told us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, deviation is a change.  And yes magnetic north variation, is the amount of deviation of which you must compute for the difference between true north and magnetic north.  This doesn&#39;t prove a sphere, it just proves that true and magnetic are not at the same place.  And yes, that is a deviation.  Nice attempt to correct me, incorrectly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why don&#39;t you just send a camera up into the air high enough to see the earth, and this entire &quot;debate&quot;, if you can call it that, will be squashed, once and for all. However, it seems that no one either wants to do this, or just doesn&#39;t care enough to. IMO, it seems like the easiest and most reliable way to check. So since no one is really doing that, it leads me to believe this whole &quot;flat earth&quot; debacle is just a bunch of bullshit.  I dont care to do it, cause i don&#39;t believe the earth is flat. I have nothing to prove here. You, on the other hand..are desperate to prove your point. So get to it, and let us know..Okie dokie??</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hahah why on Earth would I do that, when I could just spend the money and do the experiment myself?</p>

<p>Something as cheap as $500 shouldn&#39;t be that big of an issue if you&#39;re SO SURE you&#39;re going to prove the entire scientific world wrong by showing the Earth isn&#39;t a fuckin sphere.</p>

<p>And of course it will get the altitude needed. Do a god damn basic  google search if this is something you&#39;re interested in. Not only do high-altitude balloons enter the stratosphere and generally attain between 60,000 to 120,000 feet you can buy one of those balloons here FOR ONLY 55 FUCKIN DOLLARS:

I personally don&#39;t want to spend 500 bucks, to get a flat horizon, only to have people say ... &#39;you didn&#39;t go up high enough&quot;.  I&#39;ve seen high altitude cameras (like red bull stratos), that show a perfectly flat horizon line. I don&#39;t need to do the experiment.  You sir, believe that it will prove something, and you expect that I do the experiment?  If it proves something to you, do it.

<p>As for doing it myself, why? You&#39;re the one who has something to prove. Like many others have said, you can easily test this yourself but you have a refusal of doing so. I on the other hand believe that the world is round. I live in a coastal city so I can go to the harbour and watch boats disappear bottom first thus demonstrating a curvature in the Earth. I can also view a lunar eclipse and determine the shape of the earth that way. So I have nothing to prove. </p>

<p>Again, if you can completely rewrite history and wipe out everything science has ever told us was true and have your name in the books for all eternity and for generations to hail you as a hero then why is $500 dollars such a big deal? Hell look online for some used gear and maybe spend only half that. Surely you can afford to set aside $50 every paycheque for 10 paycheques. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I look for things that we can prove.  I can look at time lapses of the southern star trails, and see circles.  This means that there is simple rotation.

<p>What the circular star trails prove to me, that we do not travel around the sun and our solar system is not going through the universe.  If we had any movement other than rotation, these circles would be elliptical.  They are not.  These are simple things seen in our physical world, that can not be denied.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t usually participate in these discussions since I was banned from <a href="/r/theworldisflat">/r/theworldisflat</a>, but I figured I&#39;d chime in this time because it&#39;s a slow morning.</p>

<p>The reason a compass doesn&#39;t point toward the ground or into the air is <del>due to the shape of the Earth&#39;s magnetic field.</del> In textbooks, magnetic fields are frequently depicted as 2D pairs of concentric ovals, but this is a simplification. In reality the field of a bipolar magnet is a 3-dimensional torus.</p>

<p>EDIT: My previous statement isn&#39;t as true as I thought it was. It seems like it has as much to do with the way the standard hand compass is designed. Using a spherical magnet, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3Yhf2Vy_M8">you can indeed demonstrate magnetic declination by rolling it on a level surface</a>.</p>

<p>Your magnetic compass isn&#39;t pointing directly at the physical location of the magnetic north pole, it&#39;s aligning itself with the magnetic field running between the north and south poles. Since those field lines are a 3D torus wrapping around the earth, the field itself (approximately) follows the curvature of the Earth.</p>

<p>If you look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_magnetic_field#/media/File:Geomagnetisme.svg">this diagram of Earth&#39;s magnetic field</a> and then mentally fill in additional field lines, you&#39;ll find they&#39;re approximately match the Earth&#39;s curvature.</p>

<p>Also, IIRC, a typical magnetic compass is fairly flat anyway. The needle doesn&#39;t have much room to pivot vertically even if the field lines were pointing toward the surface.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for your response, and I&#39;m sorry that you were banned from a forum.  I say that I&#39;m sorry, because your response is one of the most logical and respectful that I have seen.  This is the type of discussion that is necessary.</p>

<p>Your response is the one that science currently accepts.  I do not know if we have actual evidence of this field, or if people are assuming that this is what creates the magnetism.  I do have some issues with this field model (in my thinking).  If the field extends between the two poles, then there are many places on the globe where that &quot;inner earth&quot; magnetism would be closer to the compass than the poles.  I also view the same problem for the proposal that the field is above the atmosphere.  There would be areas on the Earth, where the field is much closer to the poles.  </p>

<p>The major problem that I have, in the inner earth model, with the field passing from pole to pole, then the magnetic declination doesn&#39;t make sense.  </p>

<p>You are right, a typical compass is definitely flat, but that is one of the reasons that I don&#39;t see the field coming from internal or external sources. I &quot;feel&quot; (no evidence) that the compass would bind if it was really aligning to the pole to pole field, and that a pole to pole field wouldn&#39;t need different magnetic and true norths, or else the entire field would be off (because there is no Southern Declination), becuase this would mean that it goes from the exact southern pole to magnetic north.  </p>

<p>I would love a 3d compass and some more research into the magnetism of the Earth.  It seems like much of it is assumptions.  I still understand that my propositions can be incorrect, but it&#39;s just me attempting to verbalize what I don&#39;t believe makes sense.  </p>

<p>I would also like to see some studies about magnetism that don&#39;t make assumptions of it based on assumed shape of the Earth.  We should be able to test and prove our magnetism aside from these things.  I&#39;m not sure if there are unbiased magnetism studies (where the researcher didn&#39;t base their evidenced on their preconceived notions).  </p>

<p>I find it interesting that our North pole is actually the southern pole of a magnet.  For this reason, I think that either our pole is wrongly named, or that we name magnets incorrectly.  Why?  Because a positively charged compass needle points to the north.  Since magnetism is opposites attract, doesn&#39;t this mean that the Northern pole is negatively charged?  This doesn&#39;t change anything other than magnetism terminology.  If our North pole is a southern magnetic pole, then are there other assumptions in science that are incorrect also?  I believe there is room for error, and so I would like to see much more research done. </p>

<p>In other words, science is based on measurable, quantifiable, repeatable evidence, experimentation, scientific explanation... And once there is evidence-based scientific explanation for something it is true whether it makes sense to you or not.</p>

<p>If you &quot;feel&quot; strongly about this, the only real option for you then is to educate yourself and then through scientific inquiry and experimentation establish an alternative explanation.</p>

<p>If the field extends between the two poles, then there are many places on the globe where that &quot;inner earth&quot; magnetism would be closer to the compass than the poles. I also view the same problem for the proposal that the field is above the atmosphere. There would be areas on the Earth, where the field is much closer to the poles.</p>

<p>The major problem that I have, in the inner earth model, with the field passing from pole to pole, then the magnetic declination doesn&#39;t make sense.</p>

<p>The magnetic field isn&#39;t <em>just</em> above the atmosphere or absent from the Earth&#39;s interior, it extends everywhere from the Earth&#39;s core (or close to it, I don&#39;t know enough to say offhand) into space. It&#39;s similar to the grade-school science experiment with <a href="http://buildingengineertraining.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/magnetic-lines-of-force.jpg">a bar magnet and iron filings</a>. You can think of the Earth&#39;s core as the bar magnet, and draw a circle around it to represent the surface.</p>

<p>I actually wondered if there were cheap 3D magnetic compasses, so I did a quick google and saw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3Yhf2Vy_M8">this video</a>, which uses a spherical magnet to actually demonstrate the declination. I don&#39;t know why I didn&#39;t think of using that, but presumably you could get a magnet like that cheaply and try it yourself.</p>

<p>Well, the terms &quot;North&quot; and &quot;South&quot; predate the use of magnetic compasses, so it&#39;s possible a bar magnet&#39;s &quot;North&quot; pole was probably named so because it pointed north, and vise versa. We didn&#39;t really come up with the idea of positive and negative electric charges until the 1700s.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Given how simple an error it would be, it seems incredibly unlikely for it to even make it to the experiment stage, never mind peer review. If things like encyclopedias are wrong, you should be able to run simple experiments to check their results yourself.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t imagine it would, but then again I&#39;m a nerd, so maybe a &quot;layman&quot; might have a different perspective. Most sources that explain how compasses work that I remember (HS or college level) mention that earth&#39;s magnetic north pole is equivalent to the south pole of a bar magnet.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t used a magnetometer since high school, so I&#39;m not sure if/how it differs from a typical compass, so I can&#39;t really say, honestly. It may have to do with the shape of Earth&#39;s magnetic field compared to a bar magnet&#39;s, or the difference in scale making declination way more obvious, but that&#39;s just an educated guess. You&#39;d be better off asking someone in <a href="/r/askscience">/r/askscience</a> or someone with more knowledge about magnetism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you mean why am I doing this?  I started my research 6 months ago thinking that we were on a sphere.  I have looked for physical evidence in this world, and have found many lies perpetrated upon the public.  I came to find that the solar system model was bunk.  You can see this by looking at the southern star trails timelapses, which show circular movement only.  This proves that we simply rotate, and do not move around the sun.</p>

<p>There are many other lies with this.  I believe that Magnetic North and compasses are another tell of the lie of the shape of the Earth.  I also don&#39;t judge myself by what I see around us.  I believe in the Bible, and we are told that we are special.  </p>

<p>Believe what you want, but I would suggest that you look at the horrible CGI of NASA&#39;s DSCOVR moon transit, that was called EPIC moon transit. It is easily spotted as fake.  To me, it is laughable, because I deal with graphics and video creation daily.  </p>

<p>I can create better images in After Effects with Element 3d at a fraction of the budget that NASA has.  You are making some wide accusations against me.  It is as if this is the first time that you have heard of Flat Earth theory.  Considering your virgin status, I would suggest that you do some research, and attempt to find the proof of a globe.  If you can find that, I will commend you.</p>

<p>If you try to quote Greek mathematicians from 500 years ago, which some have quoted a 16% degree of error, then I would suggest that you look for some more precise and accurate sources of proof.  Also Sir Isaac Newton evaluated the Greek math, and he decided that it did not prove that the Earth was a globe.  It only showed it as a possibility.</p>

<p>So why, in 2015 do the Globe supporters lean on this Greek math as the proof of a globe?  That is ridiculous.  Keep pointing fingers at me jimmyb207.  You really are pointing out your ignorance and the fact that you have not studied this topic slightly.</p>

<p>It may be surprising, but to look at a topic scientifically, you need to look at both sides unbiased.  You are very biased, and haven&#39;t even looked at the other side.  Good luck with that.</p>
