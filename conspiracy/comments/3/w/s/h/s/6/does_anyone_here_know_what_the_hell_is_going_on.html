        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Are they just trying to crush commodities to bring in their cashless society?  Commodities should expose the fact that fiat currencies are always being devalued.  The currency &quot;values&quot; are measured only in relation to other fiat currencies so is of little value.  Warren Buffett likes to use his Big Mac index which is hilarious because anyone who has seen Cowspiracy or know how big agriculture works, with all the subsidies thrown their way the price of a Big Mac should be about $14.  I did find one article on the Chinese commodity industry in China.  It seems they can&#39;t pay their interest out to their bond holders.  How in the hell do you run a business selling your products for less than at least break even?  I think it&#39;s obvious they are being subsidized by the Chinese government or being forced to anyways.  I understand why oil prices are low as it seems obvious it has to do with hurting the Russians.  But I believe what is happening to gold and silver is really quite exposing.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong><em>Low Oil and Commodities Prices</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>1)</em></strong> The economy is in recession and since mid 2015. If you want to be technical the USA has been in recession since late 2007. It will be official in mid 2016 in the corporate owned mass media. Demand for oil and commodities is therefore low. </p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>2)</em></strong> The economy, the real economy, is collapsing. Industrial production is shrinking and they use less and less resources. The official Q3 unemployment number is 5%, the real unemployment number in the USA is between 10-23%. Demand for oil and commodities is low.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>3)</em></strong> The economy in Japan, China, Russia, Europe, Brazil and the USA are also moving into recession. Demand for oil and commodities is low.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>4)</em></strong> Saudi Arabia is pumping oil at 100% capacity in a deliberate attempt to crash the oil market. The Saudi Arabian governments goal is to hurt the USA domestic Fracking industry and their old nemesis Iran. The USA want to hurt Russia, Venezuela and Iran. Demand for oil and commodities will staying low for quite some time!</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>5)</em></strong> The strong dollar is moving into a period of Deflation/Biflation, making the oil and other commodities even cheaper. Mines and raw material extraction in general will slow down.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It will not end well. The USA is bankrupt together with UK, France, Belgium, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Venezuela and Japan. The central banks, both covertly and publicly, print money as if there were no tomorrow. Deflation will either implode into hyper inflation or a slow death by even more Deflation/Biflation. But it is not all is doom and gloom, the <strong><em>TBTF financial institutions</em></strong> will become bigger and more powerful than ever before... <strong><em>/S</em></strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Peak oil makes prices go up, then they go down. They they go up and down again. Each time they further damage the financial mechanisms which represent or rely on energy. Meanwhile oil production enjoys a bumpy plateau for a little but inevitably slows down before we&#39;re ready.</p>

<p>The geopolitics gets (even more) clusterfucked because of it. Subtle and not so subtle currency wars, jostling for access or distribution etc. Have you ever played a Civilization game? The forces at work here are not hard to comprehend if you can zoom out a little bit.</p>

<p>Fracking should be a huge screaming red alert that something is wrong with our energy situation. If we are relying on something that dirty and inefficient, wtf does that say about us as a society and as a species?</p>

<p>Also, supply doesn&#39;t matter if people can&#39;t afford to buy a car. Supply doesn&#39;t matter if the factories already scuttled because it takes 12-24months of red tape or construction or w/e to reopen or move them and by then oil prices are fucked in the opposite direction. Lordy loo even oil prices don&#39;t matter all that much if half a mil ppl need to migrate cuz of water or weather. </p>

<p>If I were you I would read or youtube lectures more. There is a billion good infos and explanations out there while the internet is still sort of free. Use it. A lot of the questions you ask in this thread and have asked in other threads are answered in detail if you look around. Godspeed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see what you&#39;re saying but usuall prices come down to a new higher norm.  We haven&#39;t seen these prices at the pumps for 15 years.</p>

<p>I have played Warcraft and age of empires.</p>

<p>I agree fracking is worrisome and could be a sign, but it seems unnecessary when you look at demand</p>

<p>Apart from oil, the only thing that makes sense to me is there is way more paper gold than physical.  The banks are using that paper to short.  Physical precious metals have never been at a higher demand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is that there is no &quot;usually&quot; with prices anymore because we&#39;ve never been here before. There is nowhere else go to for energy like we&#39;ve had in the past, no new continent to explore and rape. </p>

<p>I mentioned civ because whenever the game gets to certain stages and a new natural resource becomes available there is increased political maneuvering, borders move around more and war often breaks out over the resources. This is a pretty simple analogy and in Civ you&#39;re blessed with infinite resources once you physically acquire it. Apply those same world conditions, but now those little resource nodes are disappearing and the world starts to make more sense.</p>

<p>Re: fracking and demand. When do you suppose the fracking was funded and developed? When oil is expensive(or is slated to be expensive shortly down the road) is when these operations get funding and get installed. Oil was over $100 a barrel not too long ago. That&#39;s when fracking was cool. And then we had a recession.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A good point. Given the secrecy of the fed it is possible to screw around with anything. With physical commodities though they would have to take possession and show themselves. Probably why they usually keep subsidies in their budget. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The futures market is totally corrupted IMHO. When you short you&#39;re betting against the future price of a stock/commodity. There&#39;s so much dark money playing the game, I wouldn&#39;t touch it. Hard (in your hand) assets is the best play.</p>

<p>I will say this. Some of the gods are starting to lose money. A good sign for better, more transparent, markets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get you. But there&#39;s a big difference between physical assets and paper futures. One is much, much easier to cheat for profit. You can see whats happening with oil. They&#39;re having a hard time trying to push back the low oil prices. The bottleneck at the gulf isn&#39;t doing the trick. On the other hand, paper futures can moved with the naked shorts you were mentioning. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, backwardation. Future prices should be higher due to the cost of storage. What we&#39;re seeing is that it&#39;s selling for less. Nobody believes there&#39;s any physical gold to back up the paper. It wouldn&#39;t shock me if the entire futures market collapses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What real value does gold have? Close to none. It&#39;s fiat. We all agree it&#39;s worth something, so it&#39;s worth something. </p>

<p>Water is worth something. Wood is worth something. Steel is worth something. Food is worth something. Most people would give up all their money in exchange for a hearty meal. That is if they are hungry enough. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gold is not fiat mainly because it is limited.  It serves industrial purposes.  It got it&#39;s main appeal though because it was most likely the first metal discovered by man and resembled the Sun.  It had religious value and status value.  believe me the elites still love the stuff.  They just love power more and a cashless society will give them absolute power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gold doesn&#39;t have to be fiat, but in an economy where it is stashed away and there is a public trust put in the fact that there is indeed a limited amount, and that the amount is tied to the value of gold, then yes, it can be considered fiat in many ways.</p>

<p>Cash is more relevant to today&#39;s religions than gold. Cash also has more status value than gold today. </p>

<p>In my opinion, fiat is the way to go in today&#39;s society. No different than gold on a practical level. The only other option is barter, but there are issues with that. I am looking for one hundred pounds of copper. I have four sheep to trade. Unfortunately, the guy with one hundred pounds of copper already has a dozen sheep and doesn&#39;t need any more. What he needs is ten square meters of fabric. I find a guy who has ten square meters of fabric, but he doesn&#39;t need four sheep either. He needs a pallet of wheat. I go to the next town over and trade my four sheep for a single cow, figuring that will be easier to unload. I then trade the cow for a set of car tires. I then trade the tires for a truck-load of apples. I then trade the apples for wheat, the wheat for fabric, and the fabric for steel. </p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t it be nice if there were one item that everybody always wanted, so that the barter system could be easier? That item is cash. Now I can trade my sheep for cash, and then trade that cash for one hundred pounds of steel, and that man can then use the cash to buy his fabric. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not a fiat if the public were educated and demanded audits on the gold supply.  Fiat relies on unlimited resources.  Keynsianism is a ticking time bomb.  The bottom line is we don&#39;t need all this shit.  At least with barter they have to physically steal it from you.  With our system today the bottom of the markets drop out and no one knows what happened to all their money.  </p>
