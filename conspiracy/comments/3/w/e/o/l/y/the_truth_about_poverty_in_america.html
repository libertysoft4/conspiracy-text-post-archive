<p>Nationwide, 1.6 million American children experienced homelessness in 2014.</p>

<p>1 in 7 American households were food insecure last year.</p>

<p>The percentage of Americans living in poverty is between 14 and 15 percent.</p>

<p>2014 was the fourth year in a row that the number of Americans in poverty has remained unchanged from the previous year&#39;s estimate.</p>

<p>The highest poverty rate is among blacks (26 percent), with Hispanics a close second (24 percent). Whites in America have a current poverty rate of 10 percent.</p>

<p>Including the Supplemental Poverty Measure, which accounts for expenses such as the rising costs of health care, the poverty rate among senior American citizens is 14 percent.</p>

<p>21 percent of those living in poverty (or 1 in 5) are children.</p>

<p>The poverty rate for single-parent families with no husband present is 31 percent.</p>

<p>The poverty rate for people living with a disability is 29 percent.</p>

<p>Agree with you completely, which is why it&#39;s so frustrating being mobbed by brainwashed, low-IQ kids with their bubble gum quotes about how capitalism is the saviour of mankind.</p>

<p>Perfect analysis. Capitalism, like military fascism, works great over the short term. But the longer you use it, the more the present economic order becomes entrenched and immovable.</p>

<p>I hear this argument a lot. It simply isn&#39;t true. The faults with capitalism are integral to the system itself. It&#39;s just another poor defence of a deeply flawed system to say, &quot;Oh, it should work but we messed up&quot;. Nobody messed up. Capitalism does what it is supposed to do, and that&#39;s drain resources from the lower classes and transfer them to the higher classes. Corporatism is a natural by-product of capitalism because the elite have a common cause (i.e. to stay elite). It leads to mergers, buyouts and price-fixing scandals like we saw with the UK supermarkets not long ago. The existing market forces strategically conspire with each other to maintain control and dominance over their respective industries. The idea that they are even in competition is a lie. They don&#39;t need to be once they reach a certain size.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes, you are absolutely right. Power does corrupt. And the problem is that capitalism is a system based exclusively on acquiring economic purchasing power.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>capitalism has done more for mankind than any other type of power structure</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, it hasn&#39;t. Jesus Christ, just where do you even get these ideas from? What evidence do you have that anything mankind has achieved in the last five hundred years is because of capitalism? You have no evidence. You&#39;re just repeating stuff you&#39;ve been brainwashed with since the time you were six years old. Don&#39;t you think that a Soviet citizen in the 1970s or 1980s would say precisely the same thing about Communism? You&#39;ve been so ideologically indoctrinated that you seem to genuinely believe there was no technological evolution before capitalism.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>for the fact that it recognizes greed as human nature</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another total fucking myth. Man is a product of his environment. He is not greedy until you put him into a system which rewards him for being fucking greedy. There&#39;s no such thing as &quot;human nature&quot; in the first fucking place. It&#39;s a myth that capitalists use to con you. They show you the way man behaves after thousands of years of being conditioned into capitalism, and then fool you into thinking you&#39;d be that way without capitalism! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) Capitalism has not brought anybody out of poverty. That is not how it works. The country has finite resources, which means that every time someone takes more, someone else consequently gets less. Those people have increased poverty for those they left behind.</p>

<p>2) Even by your own warped standards, military fascism has been more successful at bringing people out of poverty than market capitalism. Nazi Germany, for example, escaped economic poverty far faster than any of its capitalist counterparts. This was proven by Francis Fukuyama&#39;s 1992 analysis of the 20th century economy:-</p>

<p>I meant that the equation is balanced. Your sudden wealth both increases poverty for those left behind and it makes it more difficult for them to acquire wealth of their own. Everybody can&#39;t be rich otherwise being rich wouldn&#39;t have any meaning. You wouldn&#39;t have any more purchasing power than the next person. Your wealth is paid for by the poor.</p>

<p>Deliberately vague, generic, and false.</p>

<p><strong>Many often ask why governments don’t print more money to deal with the problem of National debt. The reason is that printing more money doesn’t increase economic output in any way –  it merely causes inflation.</strong></p>

<p>Thanks. I love it when people condescend to me with terms I am fully aware of the meaning of. Finding a different way to explain something doesn&#39;t necessarily make explaining it another way wrong. Perhaps someone should have taught you that at Harvard.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a particularly selective (i.e. dishonest) way to put it. Capitalism promotes the people in the upper classes using the people in the lower classes to bake pie for them. We are told in economic theory that they will then be generous and give us some pie back. The same pie we baked and they simply took from us.</p>

<p>Are you saying that poverty isn&#39;t caused by segregating and/or hoarding the wealth? The very basis of capitalism? Lol. This is getting fairly bizarre. How can I even be poor unless others are rich? It&#39;s impossible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Poverty is mainly caused by an inability to manage ones&#39; finances.  You leftists just need boogeymen to blame all your problems on.  It&#39;s always &#39;racism this&#39; or &#39;capitalism that&#39; or &#39;glass ceiling this&#39; or &#39;white privilege that&#39;.  Maybe it&#39;s time to grow up and start taking responsibility, instead of remaining infantile and dependent well into middle age, like most leftists.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the same thing, brother. Capitalism is the incentive. Banksters are the result.</p>
