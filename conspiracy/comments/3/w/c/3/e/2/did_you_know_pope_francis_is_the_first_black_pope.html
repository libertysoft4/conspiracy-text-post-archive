<p>Here&#39;s an interesting Islamic perspective on masons I found on wikipedia from the jahbulon article.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masih_ad-Dajjal">DAJJAL</a>-system is of course as we know is FREEMASONRY Every single position in the United Nations, The EEC and every position in the British Parliament is held by people who are Freemasons. Freemasonry has something in the region of 700,000 members in England and Wales, yet the British public hardly know anything about them. Freemasons secretly worship a Devil-God, known as JAHBULON, If you do not believe me (see pages 230-240 of the International best selling book on Freemasonry “The Brotherhood”, by Stephen Knight &amp; “Satanic Voices”, by David M Pidcock)&quot; -- unattributed web author as referenced by Prof Prescott Mission Islam --Free Mason Invasion --<a href="http://www.missionislam.com/nwo/invasion.htm">Mission Islam --Free Mason Invasion</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jahbulon / lucifer is the god of materialism, intelligence, science, technology, fire, craftsmanship, sex, money.  Basically a Promethean force of the material world.</p>

<p>Are you basing your opinion on anything other than imagery and gut reaction and the fact they are part of the church which claims itself to be the infallible middle-man to God?  You see because I have thousands of hours of conspiracy researchers talking about this, hundreds of books and decades of research, mapping out people and tying them to places and events of intrigue, mass manipulation, theft, warmaking, political bribery, assassinations and policy subversion</p>

<p>But you know gut reaction is what you believe so no changing that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So many people deny this, but the truth is, the cap stone on the pyramid is the Holy Sea (all seeing eye, Flavians). Rome never fell, it reorganized. The Vatican is the oldest corp. Kings kneel to it&#39;s power. But duh Jews!!! No idiot, they are pawns and have been since Christianity and go further back to Egypt.... Technically, the Vatican owns the world via domain. People need to look into this, but they wont. Blame Jews or Muslims.....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>why not zoroastrianism? why just christianity? i mean, if it weren&#39;t for zoroaster, we wouldn&#39;t have the concept of monotheism. monotheism is what created &quot;one god, one king, one people&quot; etc and allowed for genocide, slavery, imperialist colonisation, etc. there&#39;s a lot on freemasonry and judaism, but all of it just seems like straight up zoroastrian occultism to me!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are correct, but that&#39;s not really the point I was getting at. My point was that Rome (via the Flavians) made up Catholicism based on a philosopher (Jesus of Nazareth). Some say he was real, same say he wasn&#39;t in this theory. By making up this religion, it gave the Flavian family the &quot;God status&quot; they needed to rule Rome as Caesars. This new religion of peace was used to qualm the Jewish revolts in the Holy Land, by getting Jews to convert to this new docile religion of &quot;peace&quot;. Two birds, one stone. Since then, the Vatican/Holy Roman Empire has run the world and own damn near the whole Earth via domain. You should look into the Tri-Sovereign States: The Vatican (religion/HQ), The City of London (banking), and The District of Columbia (military)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No worries, I probably should of explained it more in my original post.... What you said about the occult though, i believe is true. TPTB (elites) may be using such religions as a disguise, but their true beliefs are ancient occult/esoteric/mysticism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the zoroastrian religions are a good cover-up for what hides beneath. saying you&#39;re &quot;christian&quot; or &quot;jewish&quot; (of whatever sect) is a good way to hide what you&#39;re really doing.</p>

<p>there are occult practises all over the world, often called &quot;left hand paths&quot;. they strive to tap into the power of the &quot;life force&quot; of what runs this universe for personal gain. indigenous peoples, or tribal religions, did not do this. they circumvented that power through ritual in order to maintain order, establish progress, and empower their communities. it&#39;s really sad that most of those practises are gone; many of the shamanic principles are dying out and religion is vastly misunderstood and not practised correctly...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My problem with all this isn&#39;t that they would lack the means but I can&#39;t see the benefit. What&#39;s in it for upper bureaucracy and their enforcers? What does power give them individually? Are they so rich they have control over how they spend their time? Do they work for their offspring? Do they create something worthwhile?</p>

<p>I can&#39;t see these questions to be answered satisfying and that&#39;s why I can&#39;t see their motivation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All one has to do is look at Caesars Rome. The Vatican is no different and there are many ancient aristocratic families making money and influencing power around the world. By, families, I&#39;m talking about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldobrandini_family">old families like this family</a>. Most of the religious figures inside the organization are not &quot;in on it&quot;, they have no idea what is going on. As with all organizations. The higher up you are, the more you know. So, do not think every priest/bishop/cardinal/nun/etc etc are in on it. They have no idea, they are merely blind believers in the faith.</p>

<p>I guess so many of the power elite have left the Church for international banking that they finally after 1500 years could elect a decent guy.</p>
