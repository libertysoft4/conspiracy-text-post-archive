<p>I agree. You&#39;ll note they do this to everyone who calls them out. Speaking the truth about the world is a type of mental illness. It doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re Albert Einstein.</p>

<p>The way these guys rewrite history to exonerate themselves is shameful. Fisher&#39;s case is particularly bad, and I don&#39;t blame him for being bitter about it. Alright, he was fairly arrogant and demanding at times, but the US dumped him like a hot potato the moment they no longer needed him for their Cold War propaganda.</p>

<p>If I remember rightly, he became homeless for a period. I recall watching him rant about the American system on TV just before he died, with his big bushy Father Christmas beard.</p>

<p>Kasparov is another player with highly-charged political opinions. I remember seeing him on TV a while back too, lambasting Putin and the Russian state apparatus.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>His mother, Regina Fisher, was Jewish. 
It&#39;s also interesting to note that nobody really knew (except her) who really was Bobby&#39;s father. He was born while Regina and Hans-Gerhardt Fischer (the father of Bobby&#39;s older sister, Joan) had been separated for many years. At the time of Bobby&#39;s birth, Regina was living in the US, while Hans-Gerhardt was in Chile. Regina vaguely mentioned a short trip to Mexico, where she met him during the war.
In fact, Bobby Fischer&#39;s biological was most probably Paul Nemenyi, a Hungarian Jewish Physicist, with whom Regina had an affair previously (looks don&#39;t lie)...</p>

<p>Just proving you wrong (yet again!). His obvious derangement does not hang on the &quot;one sentence&quot; you claimed. He was a paranoid, rabid anti-Semite who deserves pity for his mental illness. As does anyone who finds that aspect of Fischer&#39;s life laudable. </p>

<p>I think you are very, very confused. Firstly, this is not my quote. It is Bobby Fischer&#39;s. Secondly, posting a different quote about a different topic that he said at a different time, and which has no relevance to the original quote, does not disprove the original quote.</p>

<p>You are posting amazingly stupid and transparent lies. </p>

<p>They can now, but a chess computer is only as good as the database it&#39;s loaded with. I used to be able to beat them regularly. The trick was to make your opening moves completely out of leftfield. Chances are it would have a weak analysis of the outcomes if the opening was irregular.</p>

<p>These days of course, there&#39;s pretty much no move you can make that it isn&#39;t programmed to outdo.</p>

<p>Did Fischer ever play Deep Blue? I know that it beat Kasparov.</p>

<p>Chess computers are considerably more powerful now, too. I used to play Deep Fritz a lot and it regularly destroyed me. I tried Rybka too and that&#39;s just ridiculous. Haven&#39;t ever beaten it in even a single game.</p>

<p>I liked him. He was definitely a character, and possibly the greatest chess player who ever lived.</p>

<p>Computers can beat any human at chess. Chess is a perfect problem for computers to solve.</p>

<p>They can now, but a chess computer is only as good as the database it&#39;s loaded with. I used to be able to beat them regularly. The trick was to make your opening moves completely out of leftfield. Chances are it would have a weak analysis of the outcomes if the opening was irregular.</p>

<p>These days of course, there&#39;s pretty much no move you can make that it isn&#39;t programmed to outdo.</p>
