        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Jet fuel can&#39;t melt steel beams, so why was there molten metal at the WTC collapse sites?</p>

<p>NIST claims that WTC 1&amp;2 collapsed due to jet fueled fires (just normal offices fires for WTC7) which were not hot enough to produce molten steel or iron, but also claim that if there had been molten steel or iron in the debris afterwards, it would have been irrelevant to the cause of the collapses. The evidence of molten steel or iron cannot be called “irrelevant,” given the fact that the building fires, as NIST pointed out, cannot explain it.</p>

<p><strong>Physical Evidence</strong></p>

<hr/>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.fema.gov/pdf/library/fema403_apc.pdf">Early in 2002, Barnett and two WPI colleagues published an analysis of a section of steel from one of the Twin Towers, along with sections from WTC 7, as an appendix to FEMA’s 2002 World Trade Center Building Performance Study</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.wpi.edu/News/Transformations/2002Spring/steel.html">Their discoveries were also reported in a WPI article entitled “The ‘Deep Mystery’ of Melted Steel,” which said:</a></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Steel – which has a melting point of 2,800 degrees Fahrenheit – may weaken and bend, but does not melt during an ordinary office fire. Yet metallurgical studies on WTC steel brought back to WPI reveal that a novel phenomenon – called a eutectic reaction – occurred at the surface, causing intergranular melting capable of turning a solid steel girder into Swiss cheese.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.wpi.edu/News/Transformations/2002Spring/steel.html">Stating that the New York Times called these findings “perhaps the deepest mystery uncovered in the investigation,” the article added:</a></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>A one-inch column has been reduced to half-inch thickness. Its edges – which are curled like a paper scroll – have been thinned to almost razor sharpness. Gaping holes – some larger than a silver dollar – let light shine through a formerly solid steel flange. This Swiss cheese appearance shocked all of the fire-wise professors, who expected to see distortion and bending – but not holes.</p>

<p><strong>Testimony from Firefighters:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQyIN6OTMyY">New York Fire Department Captain Philip Ruvolo said: “You’d get down below and you’d see molten steel, molten steel, running down the channel rails, like you’re in a foundry, like lava.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://fallenbrothers.com/community/showthread.php?2062-Recovery-worker-reflects-on-months-spent-at-Ground-Zero&amp;p=2948">Joe O’Toole, a Bronx firefighter who worked on the rescue and cleanup efforts, reported that one beam lifted from deep below the surface months later, in February 2002, “was dripping from the molten steel.”</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_G21B2qiQM">New York firefighters recalled in the documentary film Collateral Damages, “heat so intense they encountered rivers of molten steel.”</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Testimony from Other Professionals:</strong></p>

<hr/>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjmHqES_lto&amp;t=40s">Leslie Robertson, a member of the engineering firm that designed the World Trade Center, said 21 days after the attack: “When we were down at the B1 level, one of the firefighters said, ‘I think you’d be interested in this,’ and they pulled up a big block of concrete and there was a, like a little river of steel, flowing.”</a></li>
<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060909104247/http://www.seau.org/SEAUNews-2001-10.pdf">Ron Burger, a public health advisor at the National Center for Environmental Health who arrived at Ground Zero September 12, 2001, said: “Feeling the heat, seeing the molten steel, the layers upon layers of ash, like lava, it reminded me of Mt. St. Helen’s and the thousands who fled that disaster.”</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.jhsph.edu/Publications/Special/Welch.htm">In late fall 2001, Dr. Alison Geyh of the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health reported: “Fires are still actively burning and the smoke is very intense. In some pockets now being uncovered, they are finding molten steel.”</a></li>
<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130730103131/http://911encyclopedia.com/wiki/index.php/Publication:20121014014812">Joe Allbaugh, the Director of FEMA, said in an October 2001 interview on CBS: “It’s just too hot for rescuers to get into [some] areas. So we do not know yet what’s in those areas, other than very hot, molten material.”</a></li>
<li>Dr. Keith Eaton reported in Structural Engineer: “They showed us many fascinating slides . . . ranging from molten metal which was still red hot weeks after the event, to 4-inch thick steel plates sheared and bent in the disaster.”</li>

</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Underground fires burned at temperatures up to 2,000 degrees. As the
huge cranes pulled steel beams from the pile, safety experts worried about the
effects of the extreme heat on the crane rigging and the hazards of contact with the
hot steel. And they were concerned that applying water to cool the steel could cause
a steam explosion that would propel nearby objects with deadly force. Special
expertise was needed. <strong>OSHA called in Mohammad Ayub and Scott Jin, structural
engineers from its national office, to assess the situation. They recommended a
special handling procedure, including the use of specialized rigging and instruments.</strong></p>

<li><a href="http://gcn.com/articles/2002/09/09/handheld-app-eased-recovery-tasks.aspx">Greg Fuchek, vice president of a company that supplied computer equipment used to identify human remains, reported that “sometimes when a worker would pull a steel beam from the wreckage, the end of the beam would be dripping molten steel.”</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.sas.upenn.edu/sasalum/newsltr/summer2002/k911.html">Sarah Atlas, of New Jersey’s Task Force One Urban Search and Rescue, arrived at Ground Zero on September 11 and reported that “fires burned and molten steel flowed in the pile of ruins still settling beneath her feet.”</a></li>

<p>The fact that the rubble contained steel or iron that had been melted shows that the buildings were destroyed by something other than fire and airplane impact.</p>

<p>When all of this physical evidence is combined with the testimony about explosions from many types of professionals, the claim that the Twin Towers were brought down by nothing other than the airplane impacts and resulting fires is simply not credible</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it&#39;s correct.</p>

<p>The chips identified in the dust as being &quot;thermitic&quot; were a combination of Iron Oxide, Kaolinite clay and epoxy. To any good materials scientist, Iron Oxide, Kaolinite clay and epoxy are primer paint.</p>

<p>There was one brand of primer paint used on the floor trusses that matched the makeup of several of the &quot;thermitic&quot; chips in chemical composition, XEDS spectra, color, and a DSC peak that is consistent with burning epoxy in oxygen.</p>

<p>The best evidence from the Bentham team that the red/grey chips were thermitic came from a DSC test ran on one of the chips that showed a sharp energetic peak at around 430 degrees. They charted that DSC test in their paper (under figure 29 IIRC) and compared it with a test from another lab, LLNL, which tested actual thermite. Since the Bentham test compared favorably with the LLNL test, the Bentham team thought it proved their chip was thermitic.</p>

<p>Only one problem, they did the DSC test incorrectly.</p>

<p>The 2 authors of the paper the Bentham team used as a comparable came out and said their DSC test was ran in an inert atmosphere of ultra pure nitrogen where the Bentham team ran their DSC test in oxygen. So in essence, all they proved is that their chip made up of over 70% organic material will ignite and burn in air, just like you would expect it to.</p>

<p>Stephen Jones was made aware of this mistake in 2012 and agreed that a follow up inert atmosphere DSC test was needed...too bad it was never done. Mark Basile took $5000 in donations 2 years ago to sent a sample to an independent lab and have them run a DSC test in an inert atmosphere. That also was never done.</p>

<p>In other words, not every red grey chip was LaClede, nor would you expect it to be. There were <em>at least</em> 3 different steel primer paints in the trade towers, and the one (or more) used on the core supports is still unidentified. </p>

<p>Now that we know the DSC test in the Bentham paper was done in a completely different atmosphere than the comparable test from LLNL, we can safely say there is absolutely nothing about the red grey chips that resembles thermite in any way. Not the DSC spike, not the chemical makeup, not the XEDS spectra, not the ignition temperature, not the ratio of organic content. Nothing. </p>

<p>By the way, have you been  keeping up with your buddy Mark Basiles donor funded study? Seems he&#39;s pissed off a lot of his initial supporters with his complete lack of results after nearly <em>2 full years</em>. His donor page actually briefly turned into a picture of his face next to a picture of Donald Trump with the caption &quot;you&#39;re fired&quot; for a few days. Rick Shaddock from ANETA emailed Oystien directly and had a few interesting tidbits to share:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I received an email from Rick Shaddock today. Rick is banned here, so I will not post on his behalf, but some key points in his mail merit paraphrasing:</p>

<p>The main page documenting the project progress no longer is markbasile.org but <a href="http://www.911experiments.org/WTCdust">http://www.911experiments.org/WTCdust</a></p>

<p>Quote: &quot;The $5000 in funds have been raised. We are waiting for the transfer from the first project manager&quot;</p>

<p>The fundraiser was started by ANETA (that is: Rick) on November 1, 2012</p>

<p>Ziggi is only self-proclaiming that he is &quot;the only one authorized&quot; to communicate for Basile.</p>

<p>Ziggi did not donate to the project.</p>

<p>Ziggi is an obstacle to the acceptance of a resulting study by the scientific community.</p>

<p>Rick has left written and spoken messages to Mark Basile many times</p>

<p>Basile must hire independent labs and present results, or return the $5000 funds.</p>

<p>Basile has broken many promises.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seems like Basile is sandbagging a very simple process. Pack up some dust in a Tupperware container, FedEx it to a lab along with a cheque and have them tell you what the fuck it is. </p>

<p>That he hasn&#39;t is <em>extremely</em> telling. </p>

<p>Nah, you&#39;re just being pedantic because I&#39;ve taken your precious paper apart a brick at a time and you have no response for it. You could say I&#39;ve <em>progressively collapsed</em> it. </p>

<p>The theory is that the red grey chips were primer paint, no matter which of the brands they came from (some of which are still unidentified). A good deal of them are a spot on match for LaClede, which supports that argument. </p>

<p>Not only that, but there is not a shred of evidence that the chips are <em>anything but</em> primer paint. The only evidence the Bentham team had that they were thermitic was the DSC test, which was done incorrectly and <strong>never followed up on</strong>. </p>

<p>You get that part, right? Jones and company knew that their test was done in the wrong atmosphere, yet they didn&#39;t follow up with the LLNL lab and they didn&#39;t rerun their tests in an inert atmosphere. They basically left their own paper for dead. Mark Basile&#39;s attempt at a donor funded transparent study has become a laughable flaming train wreck, attacked by the very truthers that sponsored it. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve provided proof that some of the chips are exactly that. Same XEDS spectra, same ignition temperature, same color, same chemical makeup, same ratio of organic material. </p>

<p>But you&#39;ve got it all wrong. The burden of proof is on <em>you</em>. We know for a stone cold fact that multiple primer paints were used in the trade towers. We know for a stone cold fact that those primer paints would have been present in the trade center dust. There is zero question of that. </p>

<p>What there <em>isn&#39;t</em> is proof that your magical <em>thermite</em> pixie dust was in the towers. The sample claimed to be thermite by Jones doesn&#39;t match any known composition of thermite ever seen. Not in XEDS spectra, not in ignition temperature, not in chemical makeup, not in ratio of organic matter. The only evidence that your sample was thermitic came from an improperly done test that the authors <strong>never followed up on</strong>! Without the DSC test, your red grey chips share almost every property with ordinary steel primer paint and none with thermite. </p>

<p>The existence of elemental aluminium in the red chips is proven by the formation of the microspheres in the DSC, largely iron. What else can start to rip the oxygen out of iron oxide at below 400 deg C, then have a runaway temperature increase at least to the melting point of iron? Those who dispute this on the grounds that oxygen was present, and that the energy came from the combustion of organic material, must provide an explanation for why such special conditions are required in a blast furnace to produce iron. The idea that you could heat a little kaolin and coke and iron oxide to a mere 400 deg C and see it suddenly run away and produce molten iron is clearly a fantasy.</p>

<p>Your off topic &quot;points&quot; don&#39;t support your unproven paint hypothesis. I already told you, I&#39;m staying on topic. You want to switch to Basile because you are embarrassed that your claim:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;it was LaClede primer paint. &quot; - <a href="/u/Pvt_Hudson_">/u/Pvt_Hudson_</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>has been disproven. But it isn&#39;t my job to help you prove that now the chips are some other primer paint that you can&#39;t identify. That&#39;s all you. </p>

<p>And I already told you that if our <em>audience</em> wants to see my response to the DSC, I&#39;ll be happy to link to my lengthy response that you tap danced and ran away from in our previous conversation on the exact same topic. </p>

<p>However, once again, I&#39;m staying in topic. You claimed LaClede. You were proven wrong by your own source. Now you&#39;re claiming an unknown paint. So... find it and prove it. No one is going to help you. Not even your own sources apparently.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you aren&#39;t going to address those points, why are you still replying? You&#39;re wasting my time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>0 of your attempts at topic shifting prove the actual topic. You claimed LaClede. You were proven wrong. But you&#39;re still desperately clinging to primer paint. And yet, you can&#39;t prove it. </p>

<p>If I&#39;m wasting your time, why are you still responding with off topic comments? You must have a lot of time to waste.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I provided evidence that someof the chips are indeed primer paint</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope. Not the ones in question from Harritt/Jones anyway.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t Tnemec</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t LaClede.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t prove it&#39;s paint.</p>

<p>Sorry.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Same XEDS spectra, same chemical composition, same ignition temperature, same color.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Based on a computer model based on the authors own &quot;assumptions.&quot; Which of course, is one of the reasons:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am at this point fully ready to admit that something is wrong about the identification of some red-gray chips specifically as LaClede paint.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interesting.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oooops. Guess not. Looks like primer paint in fire produces Iron microspheres</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Dr. Harrit has never claimed that thermitic reactions were the sole method of melting steel.</p>

<p>He does not believe that an ordinary wood fire in a steel barrel is going to heat primer paint to the point that iron oxide will melt into iron-rich microspheres.</p>

<p>Dave&#39;s test is a mess just like is infamous steel wool hand waving.</p>

<p>Take an old steel barrel (likely heavily contaminated with welding-created iron-rich microspheres), dump in a pile of wood fuel, burn off the primer paint from steel, extract steel from debris sludge at the bottom of the barrel, scrap off residue and examine.</p>

<p>Two iron-rich microspheres are found and are immediately attributed to the burned primer paint.</p>

<p>The possibility of contamination being the source of Dave&#39;s discovery of a couple of microspheres is never acknowledged or considered.</p>

<p>Why only two?</p>

<p>Why not a myriad of various microspheres, spheroids etc?</p>

<p>How strange that in all the heat experiments previously reported on primer paints, iron-rich microspheres were not discovered.</p>

<p>Who knew it was so easy.</p>

<p>Dr. Harrit replied to me that Dave&#39;s test was rubbish and that when Dave publishes his work, Dr. Harrit will gladly respond&quot;</p>

<p>You guys all seem to have trouble getting published on this matter.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;no, we have not found any paper dealing with the formation of iron-rich microspheres during burning of any paint.&quot; - Ivan Kminek</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sorry</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I don&#39;t know why you found this or that kind of spheres in the residue.” - Oystein</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sorry</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;So how do I explain Fig 21 (high Fe, low O, post DSC), within my framework? I can&#39;t at this time...&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sorry. I continue to await some kind of primer paint proof. What&#39;s taking so long? You seem to have a lot of free time.</p>

<p>You did? I don&#39;t recall that at all.</p>

<p>I recall you posting nonsense from a blogger named &quot;Ziggi&quot;, who has no affiliation with the study, in order to hand wave away the fucked up DSC test.</p>

<p>I recall you <strong>not</strong> having an answer at all for why the DSC test was never followed up on, or why the authors of your paper never contacted the LLNL lab, or why a test in an inert atmosphere was never performed even though Stephen Jones said it would be best.</p>

<p>As far as my points being &quot;off topic&quot;, the comment of mine that <strong>your initial reply</strong> to jacks1000 daisy chained off of <em>specifically</em> mentioned the screwed up DSC test, and the Basile debacle. It seems that those points are completely on topic.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Based on a computer model based on the authors own &quot;assumptions.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually the simulated XEDS spectra is based off of the materials sheet for LaClede primer. No assumptions needed.</p>

<p>There is also the batch that Ivan Kmenik mixed up and tested based on that same materials sheet.</p>

<p>So, let&#39;s hear it PM. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Why was the DSC test done incorrectly? </p></li>
<li><p>Why was the LLNL lab never contacted prior to the DSC test to confirm what atmosphere it should be ran in?</p></li>
<li><p>Why was the LLNL lab not contacted <em>after</em> it became known that the DSC test was incorrectly done? Jones himself said following up with them was necessary, yet no one did. Why?</p></li>
<li><p>Why has no one attempted a DSC test on the red/grey chips in an inert atmosphere? Jones said it would be for the best. Basile agreed that it would be for the best. Yet no one has run one...why?</p></li>
<li><p>Why has it taken <strong>over 3 years and $5000 of donor money</strong> for the Mark Basile follow up study, which to this point has produced absolutely zero results?</p></li>
<li><p>Why is Rick Shaddock (who set up the donation page through ANETA in November of 2012 and was one of Basile&#39;s biggest backers) now accusing him of dishonesty?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Try sacking up and answering these points that you keep ducking. You disagree that the red grey chips are paint. Duly noted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, what a long, off topic response. You went from at least part of your comments being on topic, to none of it. Do you think if you just keep making them longer, the audience won&#39;t notice? And why are you still begging me to go off topic? I literally just told you that if the audience wants that information, I will link them. You were already given the information. You simply want to talk about it again because you were proven wrong about the primer paint. That is literally the topic. And again, you can attempt a topic shift if you like. I will not participate. I will continually point out that your theory about the primer paint has not been proven or even supported. In fact, the primer paint you claim has been disavowed by your own sources. Make your comments as long as you like. I will respond to the portions that actually address the topic. </p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>Jet fuel sprayed onto the surfaces of typical office workstations burned away within a few minutes.  The jet fuel accelerated the burning of the workstation, but did not significantly affect the overall heat released. </p></li>
<li><p>In the simulations, none of the columns with intact insulation reached temperatures over 300 °C.  Only a few isolated truss members with intact insulation were heated to temperatures over 400 °C in the WTC 1 simulations and to temperatures over 500 °C in the WTC 2 simulations.  In WTC 1, if the fires had been allowed to continue past the time of building collapse, complete burnout would likely have occurred within a short time since the fires had already traversed around the entire floor, and most of the combustibles would already have been consumed.  In WTC 2, if the fire simulation were extended for 2 hours past the time of building collapse with all windows broken, the temperatures in the truss steel on the west side of the building (where the insulation was undamaged) would likely have increased for about 
40 min before falling off rapidly as the combustibles were consumed.  Temperatures of 700 °C to 760 °C were reached 
over approximately 15 percent of the west floor area for less than 10 min.  Approximately 60 percent of the floor steel had temperatures between 600 °C and 700 °C for about 15 min.  Approximately 70 percent of the floor steel had temperatures that exceeded 500 °C for about 45 min.  At these temperatures, the floors would be expected 
to sag and then recover a portion of the sag as the steel began to cool.  The temperatures of the insulated exterior and core columns would not have increased to the point where they would have experienced significant loss of strength or stiffness. </p></li>

<p>[...t]he simulations were insensitive to both the amount and distribution of the jet fuel. Sensitivity studies showed that the amount of fuel spilled in the simulation only influenced the results of the first few minutes; the long-term behavior of the simulated fires was unaffected.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>NIST NCSTAR 1-5F, p.56</p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>For a large over-ventilated jet-fuel pool fire, the heat release rate per unit area is reported to be approximately 2 MW/m²<sup>[13].</sup> As one limiting scenario, we consider that the plane dumped its whole fuel load over only one floor (smashing all material on that floor, including both combustible and non-combustible matter). Then the fuel would cover this floor to an average depth of nearly 0.8 cm, and the fuel load per unit area would be approximately 6.2 kg/m². In this case, we consider the fuel to be instantaneously ignited and begin burning with a heat release rate of approximately 2 MW/m², yielding a total heat release rate in this scenario of several GW. At this burning rate, the jet fuel would be consumed in only a few minutes, assuming an adequate air supply, and even in less time if the fuel were spread over a greater area. These estimates are consistent with those given in the FEMA/ASCE study<sup>[7]</sup> and are important because they demonstrate that <strong>the jet fuel would be consumed quickly relative to the duration of the tower fires</strong>. </p>

<p>He makes 80k a year - he took a paycut to help the 9/11 truth movement. He has produced, by far, the BEST materials on 9/11.</p>

<p>The one &quot;nanothermite&quot; study he supported was debunked and mysteriously has no money to get it retested at another lab using the correct method.</p>

<p>You are completely full of shit, but then again, you are perfectly aware of that.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not working, no one is buying your defamation of the 9/11 truth movement. </p>

<p>Maybe you should spend a little time investigating the background of the lab and employees who did the tests. It&#39;s all shrouded in shady, shady procedure.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t fool us scientists, which is why we haven&#39;t taken the study seriously and aren&#39;t holding our breath for a second study. </p>
