<p>As we all know, it is a historical fact that chemtrails existed. The debate on chemtrails today should really be a debate about whether or not chemtrails <em>still</em> exist, not whether or not they are a possibility. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.livescience.com/23795-large-area-coverage-dangers.html">During the 1950s and &#39;60s, the U.S. Army dusted chosen American cities from coast to coast with a fine powder of a fluorescent, potentially toxic chemical. And now one scientist says, at least in the case of St. Louis, that powder may have contained radioactive material.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2002/apr/21/uk.medicalscience">Millions were in British germ war tests</a></p>

<p>Another issue I see with the chemtrail crowd is the possibility of wasted time and energy. Let&#39;s assume chemtrails don&#39;t exist. Now, the factories which pollute the world&#39;s air are given a free pass because potential candidates for environmental activism are busy chasing ghosts. That is the secondary purpose of this subreddit- to steer some of that energy towards <em>actual</em> environmental activism and awareness. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/350/bmj.h1111">One important environmental exposure that may be related to anxiety is air pollution. Specifically, exposure to particulate matter air pollution may induce or exacerbate anxiety through increased oxidative stress and systemic inflammation, or through promotion or aggravation of chronic disease.</a></p>

<p>I get that, but saying that  Operation Large Area Coverage was real, thus chemtrails were real is a bit disingenuous in my opinion. My reason is that while Operation LAC was real, that does not provide a basis for the reality of the types of chemtrails typically discussed today on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. Operation LAC and the types of chemtrails discussed today are completely different and one having existed in the past is not evidence that the other ever existed. If you want to define Operation LAC as a chemtrail operation, then go for it. Just understand that that comes with the caveat that the chemtrails used in Operation LAC are completely different and unrelated to chemtrails discussed today.</p>

<p>You are completely misunderstanding the point. People dismiss chemtrails because they believe such a thing is so outlandishly crazy it is not even worth considering. By highlighting historical examples, it&#39;s much more difficult to dismiss the idea. Now you cannot say &quot;that is so crazy, the government would never do that.&quot; Why do you have an issue with me correcting a myth?!</p>

<p>As a disclaimer, I am agnostic on the issue of widespread chemtrails being used to control the weather. I like to stick with factual information. </p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>Using your logic, the &quot;chemtrails&quot; discussed today shouldn&#39;t be called chemtrails. That is known as &quot;possible geoengineering.&quot; </p>

<p>I&#39;m really confused by this. Are you saying that because Operation LAC was real, it&#39;s now harder to dismiss the idea that a different form of chemtrail is currently being used? That doesn&#39;t make sense to me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now you cannot say &quot;that is so crazy, the government would never do that.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, but it&#39;s still just as easy to say &quot;this is so crazy, because there is no evidence for it.&quot; Operation LAC being real does nothing to provide legitimacy to other chemtrail theories. I think that&#39;s the point that you&#39;re missing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why do you have an issue with me correcting a myth?!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t have any issue with you correcting any myths. My issue is with you saying that chemtrails were a historical fact. If you define operation LAC as chemtrails, then you can technically say this, but I think it&#39;s misleading because Operation LAC being real does not in any way provide evidence for the historical or current existence of chemtrails as most people understand them.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s great. I&#39;m really confused as to why you would make a subreddit about chemtrails then. I do really like the emphasis you on air pollution. As you stated that&#39;s a very real problem. I just don&#39;t understand why you wouldn&#39;t instead make a subreddit about air pollution.</p>

<p>Really slow:</p>

<p>Person A says the government may be spraying the population with a chemical (barium, aluminum, whatever)</p>

<p>Person B says &quot;The government would not spray the population with chemicals. That is just crazy. People would know about it, and they probably have a conscience.&quot; </p>

<p>Person A retorts: &quot;The government did spray the population with chemicals and bacteria over many decades without their knowledge. See here, here, here, here, and here.&quot;</p>

<p>Person B says &quot;Oh, I guess that I cannot dismiss this idea by calling it crazy and/or claim this has never happened before and/or claim its impossible because of their conscience and inability to cover it up.&quot;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand why this is so hard for you to get. It breaks down a few myths that are used to dismiss the idea. Go ahead and dismiss the idea. I have no issue with that, but don&#39;t dismiss it by calling it whacky, outlandish, impossible, etc because it&#39;s not. The only part of the debate is whether or not they are still doing this in some capacity. What you are doing is attempting to completely separate the individual chemicals and claiming that since the government sprayed the population with chemicals and bacteria A through X, that has nothing to do with whether they are spraying us with chemical Y and Z. Obviously the previous spraying incidents are evidence that it is possible that it is still happening. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You apparently didn&#39;t read anything I&#39;ve written so far, so I will copy paste:</p>

<p>I am trying to boost the reputation of the &quot;chemtrail&quot; crowd and making the theory more palatable for average people, while also showing people that their concerns are currently a reality (aerial pesticide exposure).</p>

<p>You are completely misunderstanding the point. People dismiss chemtrails because they believe such a thing is so outlandishly crazy it is not even worth considering. By highlighting historical examples, it&#39;s much more difficult to dismiss the idea. Now you cannot say &quot;that is so crazy, the government would never do that.&quot; </p>

<p><strong>Notice I did not say anywhere that I believe Operation LAC is proof of geoengineering. Please buy some fucking glasses. Good day, sir!!!</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>No but you are saying that operation LAC makes the idea of chemtrails sound less crazy. This may work on someone who isn&#39;t well versed in logic, but it won&#39;t work on someone who is. This is because operation LAC provides no evidence for chemtrails, so the &quot;craziness&quot; level for chemtrails stays the same.</p>

<p>I think most people who call chemtrails crazy don&#39;t call it that because the government had never done anything wrong. We call it crazy because there&#39;s no evidence. So until you provide some evidence of chemtrails, I will continue to call them crazy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well what &quot;reality&quot; are you trying to steer people towards. That chemtrails aren&#39;t &quot;that crazy?&quot; I have a problem with that because I don&#39;t really care where you think it falls on the crazy scale. What&#39;s important, and what you seem not willing to admit, is that there&#39;s no evidence of chemtrails. You seem to think that chemtrails are somehow &quot;less crazy&quot; than people think they are, but there is still no evidence for them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No <strong>proof</strong> it was <strong>radioactive.</strong></p>

<p>It is a historical fact that zinc cadmium sulphide was sprayed all over the country. There is <strong>evidence</strong> that some of it was radioactive, but that is a small issue compared to the overall point that the chemtrailing took place. </p>
