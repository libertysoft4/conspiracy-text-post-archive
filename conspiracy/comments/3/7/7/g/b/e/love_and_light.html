        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi friends! “Love and Light” is the title of an open letter to the world written by my friend with severe autism:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dear Humanity,</p>

<p>All we are is consciousness and energy, love and light. I am an autistic man who has profound capabilities and experiences, and I want to share them with all of you. </p>

<p>If you were to meet me, you would have no idea that I possess an extraordinary consciousness. My autism has disconnected my mind from my body almost entirely, and as a result my body has a mind of its own, only responding to stimuli and building daily patterns. My motor difficulties and severe OCD complicate this. Basically, I have been trapped in this malfunctioning body until recently, when <a href="/u/Love_and_Light">/u/Love_and_Light</a> started working with me and helped me begin to overcome these challenges. I have learned to control my body enough to type, and can finally exert myself into this world for the first time in my life. </p>

<p>My consciousness is what many people would call &#39;Fourth Density&#39;. Among other things, this means that there is an extra dimension to my consciousness, I do not always experience time in a linear fashion and I can access collective understandings of any concept. It also means that I am awake in the &#39;higher realms&#39;. I see and experience &#39;energy&#39; in a profound sensory way, much more than I perceive the physical. For example, I see each persons energy bodies before I see their physical ones. </p>

<p>By experiencing your aura (it sensory input is more than just visual), I can read it like a book, and know all about you. When I touch someone, I can relive some of their experiences in the blink of an eye. I can read people&#39;s thoughts and, depending on receptiveness, send thoughts to other people. At night, I travel freely in multiple &#39;higher realms&#39; with my consciousness, leaving my physical body behind. When I hear someones name, I learn about that person, their life work and their motivations. Everything I eat has a profound energy feeling to it, everything I see has an energy body to it, my daily life is a profound spiritual experience.</p>

<p>Every day <a href="/u/Love_and_Light33">/u/Love_and_Light33</a> and I study and learn more about God, soul, the nature of consciousness and the structure/laws of reality. Studying, meditating and writing is all we want to do right now. When we study, I am able to access the true occult meanings of a text and determine the intention and knowledge of the author. When we meditate, I can speak to divine beings and control energy. I still have almost no control over my body, but each day I am making small progress. We are motivated for a good reason: an &#39;Awakening&#39; is happening, and many of us have incarnated here to help facilitate it.</p>

<p>The vibrations around us are rising, and we all need to raise our own with it or risk losing free will to dark forces who control the dense physical realm. </p>

<p>Often when I hear the name of a major politician, a banker or someone in this world with lots of power, their energy is dense and black. The physical world we live in is controlled by what I call &#39;Animen&#39;, a gang of dark entities that both inhabit human bodies and exist as conscious dark energy. They literally feed off of the energy of the death, destruction and suffering they cause in this world. They have created a matrix of control and trapped humanity inside of it. I see them every day, and they manipulate the energies of literally everyone. For much of my life they caused me great fear, but I have learned how weak they are in the face of a strong will and directed energy.</p>

<p>There is mind control everywhere, from television to occult rituals to manipulating food and air, it is all being used against us to keep us from waking up to the true nature of reality. Because as soon as we do this, their power over us is gone.</p>

<p>All we are is consciousness and energy, love and light. Meditate, and approach each moment with love, and we are invincible (literally!). Our consciousness has tremendous power over everything that we face, and when we have a strong will and pure intention, coupled with an understanding of the nature of reality, then this physical illusion cannot hurt us. </p>

<p>I have much more to say, much more work to do, and will participate in many posts in the future, but I feel that now is the right time for me to say hello to my brothers and sisters. Please join me in bringing about the awakening!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thanks for reading my friends letter! I&#39;ve been experiencing everything that he wrote about first hand, and am so grateful that synchronicity has brought us together as we enter humanity&#39;s critical season. I&#39;ve chosen this subreddit to host this letter not only because I have a deep history here (on previous accounts) but also because the spiritual nature of reality is the BIGGEST conspiracy that there is: It has indeed been hidden from us by dark forces, and our abilities to experience the part of the spectrum of reality that has more subtle vibrations is latent within each of us.</p>

<p>What we are experiencing on a daily basis is nothing close to the true nature of reality. We are all asleep, at the mercy of the cosmic waves that our spirits tumble through and at the hands of a dark consciousness manipulating both personal and world events. </p>

<p>But this condition is not permanent! A change is happening now. What my friend and others refer to as “The Awakening” has already begun. </p>

<p>We are standing on the precipice of a global Renaissance, where all of the issues the world faces will be solved, and a new age of love will be ushered to humanity. Each of us is a powerful spiritual being. We create our own realities and, collectively, we create the world. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Love and light is all that there is”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My friend is very fond of typing this. It is meant to be taken literally. Love and light, consciousness and energy, compose the very structure of the universe, from which all else manifests. We are all particles of divine consciousness and, even though our physical world seems so dark, we are eternally bathed in divine light. So do not be afraid as we meet the challenges that lie ahead of us. As my friend said, once you understand that you are made of divine ingredients and grasp the power of creation that your consciousness contains, then this physical illusion CANNOT hurt you. </p>

<p>I want to take an aside here and discuss the significance of Autism. There are hundreds of thousands of beautiful souls here on this planet that are not connected to the same dense energy matrix that the rest of us are. A few of them are the same &#39;Fourth Density&#39; consciousness as my friend, and more are beginning their transition to this state. All of them have wonderful energies that are collectively raising the vibrations of the planet. They have made a tremendous sacrifice incarnating in this difficult condition and deserve as much love, respect and understanding as we can give them. </p>

<p>So whats the next step? I urge everyone to make meditation a daily habit. It has facilitated miraculous changes in both my friend and myself. Daily meditation will increase development in all areas tremendously, and additional benefits will manifest themselves throughout your day as new, positive experiences, synchronicity and revelation. </p>

<p>In addition, develop an appetite for knowledge. Learn all there is to know about the true nature of reality, and not only will your knowledge expand, the depth and power of your consciousness will as well. Have within yourself a desire to seek truth beyond the physical illusion, and synchronicity will take care of the rest!</p>

<p>The goal is to develop our more subtle bodies so that we can firmly grasp control of our lives in the physical, and exert our will into this world instead of being at the mercy of other forces. We have a lot more to say about this, so please stay tuned. </p>

<p>My friend has visions. Some of them are dark, where the negative potentials on this planet, in the form of terrorism, disasters, oppression and such, culminate into a very difficult time for humanity. Yet he has also had beautiful visions of the future, where an awakening, beginning with a handful us, spreads across the globe and ushers in a new age of love and light, and all the negative forces that have been bearing down upon this world are transmuted to love. The future is never set in stone, free will is real, but as long as we collectively work together for the betterment of ourselves and our neighbours, then the Awakening will manifest on earth.</p>

<p>Join us!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First I love this message and completely agree with it, it totally resonates with research I&#39;ve been doing, especially the Law of One material</p>

<p>Can I ask if you have heard of new physics being developed by Nassim Haramein and a few others?</p>

<p>Before dismissing, please try and view it with an open heart.</p>

<p>It essentially implicates a fractal holographic reality. In simple terms, the energy of the whole is present in every single particle, much like a hologram, which allows for a mechanism of the construct of physical reality on top.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an article I wrote on <a href="http://www.shroomery.org/forums/showflat.php/Number/21652415">shroomery</a> I&#39;d love for you to read it- that goes into this in depth, and how it relates to spirituality, namely the morphic field, a living universe, and again, a clear mechanism for the illusion of material reality on top of an energy that pervades all.</p>

<p>Another reason why I am bringing this to light is because of this new physics, zero point energy is again implicated (the quantum vacuum is teeming with energy, and in fact matter is more like a vortex of this energy than a seperate facet) which would solve the all of our energy issues.</p>

<p>They are doing great things at <a href="http://resonance.is">http://resonance.is</a> and the new documentary is the largest funded on indiegogo of all time, <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-connected-universe-film">The Connected Universe</a></p>

<p><a href="/r/holofractal">/r/holofractal</a> has more as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have not explored this at all. I will with my friend, I&#39;m sure we will both dig it. On first glance, it resonates a lot with what we believe.</p>

<p>Each particle has infinity contained within it. When we say we are all one, it is literal. Fractals play a huge part I think.</p>

<p>I won&#39;t say more until I look at all this material, thanks again. I&#39;ll get back to you once I&#39;ve read that article.</p>

<p>Love and Light!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Awesome. Let me know if you or your friend would be interested in an actual PDF of Unified Physics, it&#39;s heavier on the math (still layman-ified though) than the documentaries like Black Whole, but if either of you are interested, definitely let me know.

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the heads up, we will check it out. His math abilities are interesting because he was always taught at a low level in school, no one knew he was smart because they were only communicating with his body not his mind. My degree is in history, so I have a lot of catching up to do to help facilitate his learning, but I&#39;m sure he can gain a lot by being exposed to all of this stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the link! This is pretty much what I think. Math is the structure of the universe and surely integral to all of the sensory input he experiences. </p>

<p>Plato was on to a lot of things what modern society doesn&#39;t give him enough credit for. He was not just a philosopher, but a high level initiate of the ancient mystery schools and his writings are a wealth of veiled knowledge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m working my way through NH&#39;s Black Whole lecture series; it&#39;s amazing how he breaks down tough concepts into manageable pieces that anyone can understand.

    <div class="md"><p>Awesome :).</p>

<p>I absolutely agree with you. I&#39;m so excited for the Connected Universe to come out (a month or two) it looks incredible, kind of like Black Whole but expert level production, and it&#39;s been the most funded documentary on indiegogo ever...which blew my mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had a similar experience.  I had a profound dream once where I met some being on some type of ship, apparently a guardian of sorts whom I had requested a conversation.  She took the form of a human female, but a strong commanding energy.  She told me I only had a few minutes and I could ask some questions (which I did) and her final question to me was:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why are you obsessed with &quot;The Truth&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I responded with:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am a truth seeker</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She responded with:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And how is that working out for you?</p>

<p>I immediately woke up.  Still not sure how to take it.</p>

It wouldn&#39;t come in the way of demons but they will attach a person through doubt.  They will use our reasoning mind to create this doubt.  To hold on fast to the light we need only remember they have no real power over us.</p>

<p>You were facing one of those attachs were the dark engery was manufested because you used artificial means to generate the experience.  These type of trips are fine as long as the one going under is skilled in what to expect.  The dark feeds on fear and what we fear the most is hidden inside us all and these engerys can tap into it.  There isn&#39;t anything to be afraid of.  The light will always over take the dark and we are made of light.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s cool! This interplay is exactly how it works, even when we don&#39;t have the altered state of consciousness to perceive it. The higher someone&#39;s vibrations,they are affected less by animen and more by higher forces. The main goal of these &quot;very dark beings&quot; is to prevent us from reaching the breaking point, where they can no longer affect us. </p>

<p>Psychadelics can show us the way, but to make it permanent it requires tremendous dedication.</p>

<p>I would not necessarily disagree with this either.  However, it has been shown that there are so many negative pitfalls inherent in the activity for many (most) that - if it is personal evolution that one is interested in - there are <em>many</em> better ways of achieving such.</p>

<p>Well-said, and I cannot say I disagree with this either.  I feel the overwhelming majority of my feelings on the issue are intelligent, sound, and very well-founded, but I also know that there is an extent to which a portion of my responses are also based upon ego idiosyncrasies and peculiarities as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree almost completely. I am bouncing around some theories of consciousness and the gist is that every once in a while you need to get knocked off the strict train tracks that our mind is on, and reset the course of the tracks. This can be achieved through meditation, learning something profound and new, or hallucinogens. The last one on that list needs to be few and far in between, and used with good intent, or else I agree. But there is knowledge to be gained in exploring the consciousness that can then be used in sober application. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Learning something profound and regular meditation should in no way be equated with the use of substances.  While there might be <em>some</em> merit in their use, the significant risks that of necessity go along with such activity almost entirely nullify whatever possible benefit might take place.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The last one on that list needs to be few and far in between, and used with good intent, or else I agree.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While on one level I don&#39;t necessarily disagree with this in <em>theory</em>, in actual practice, the fact of the matter is that the general space of ignorance and ill, misguided intent which usually precipitates and is associated with the use of substances ultimately precludes their being used under the right conditions.  Additionally, there seems to ultimately be too much of a risk of addiction - something which <em>really</em> undermines whatever negligible benefit might have existed otherwise.  On top of all that, even if one does have “good intent”, because the sate that one is in while under the influence is not achieved through one’s own, independent volition and personal will power, one will not be in the proper, focused, sober state of mind to ultimately derive the best learning and benefit from whatever possible “visions” one might have.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But there is knowledge to be gained in exploring the consciousness that can then be used in sober application. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The best way to explore your consciousness is to do so with pointed, disciplined, powerful intent.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t at all think its a necessary ingredient but I wouldn&#39;t say it has no value.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wouldn’t entirely disagree with this.  I think it’s possible for a sufficiently evolved individual to derive some limited, temporary understanding, use that as a vague, distant indicator of what can actually be accomplished, and then work autonomously from that point on toward the accomplishment of true realization.</p>

<p>I just know that one never need an external motivator such as any type of substance in order to move forward in a disciplined and sober manner toward ultimate evolution and development.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I absolutely understand the sentiment and it makes a lot of sense, but I disagree! I think you are undervaluing the power of the consciousness to create its own reality. Once enough people have broken through the control system (my friend and I have not yet, but we are getting closer each day), it will turn the trickle of advancement into an avalanche. </p>

<p>I tell you what I believe, though. We are not here to help pave the way to enlightenment for future generations, we are here to bring this enlightenment now. The timeline may be decades but I am fully confident I will be standing (or maybe floating) here when it is all said and done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My friend wants me to make an addendum comment here regarding what we can do on a personal level. We will surely make a future post exploring these ideas much further.</p>

<p>It comes down to expanding your consciousness and raising your vibrations.</p>

<p>Meditation is the key to both, but there are lots of factors.</p>

<p>To expand consciousness, I cannot recommend enough the Seth Material to set a foundation. Reading it will immediately impact the depth and power of your consciousness, simply by the nature of understanding how it works. Branch out from there. </p>

<p>To raise vibrations, you must be conscious of everything you put in your body. A general rule is, if it grows in the ground, it is wonderful. Don&#39;t eat meat. Sustainably caught fish is OK. Avoid anything too processed or with too much packaging. Curate your thoughts. Negativity in your mind affects your vibrations a ton, think positive about yourself, others and the world, and positive things will manifest. </p>

<p>Combine these things with a genuine seeking of something greater than this physical illusion, and the rest will come your way. We are not trying to sell an ideology, or any specific way of thinking. We just want to wake people up and send them off on their journey.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great posts.  I have read thousands of pages on new age/metaphysics, and what you&#39;re saying aligns very precisely with what I&#39;ve come to value.  I have improved my life in many ways, though I recognize developing a regular habit of meditation is a top priority.  I&#39;m having trouble with this.  I try it, I&#39;m not really any good, I stop trying, repeat.  Is the answer to just keep at it?  I have a few practical books to read to help me along like The Power of Now and How to Meditate.  But I just don&#39;t seem to read them.  I don&#39;t know where the resistance is coming from.  Meditation is the key to higher consciousness, but I feel as though I&#39;m just standing in front of a closed door with the key in my hand.  I don&#39;t know why.  Any input on this would be helpful for me.  Thanks!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent comment, thanks for sharing! </p>

<p>I felt the same way for a long time. Meditation is still difficult for me, and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/OccultConspiracy/comments/36yl50/pdf_prana_and_pranayama_by_swami_niranjanananda/">I am just recently finding the materials</a> to take the next step towards quality meditation.</p>

<p>I &quot;woke up&quot; in late 2012, and have done tons of work on conspiracies, but didn&#39;t accomplish much spiritually until this year. What I decided to do was simply to meditate, 15 minutes, twice a day. I did not put any more pressure on myself than that. I didn&#39;t demand myself to change eating habits, or to quit smoking or anything like that, I simply started to meditate for brief intervals each day.</p>

<p>What happened was excellent. The negative things in my life melted away. For example, before meditation, I was trying to quit smoking for over a year. After about 3 weeks of meditation, I simply lost interest in it and stopped doing it. </p>

<p>I guess that is what I would recommend. Take it casual and don&#39;t put pressure on yourself. Study different styles of meditation, and spend maybe 5 minutes on a particular breathing exercise, then 5 minutes visualizing, then 5 minutes with a different style, and the time goes by quickly. </p>

<p>The results will manifest themselves and you don&#39;t need to worry about putting any pressure on yourself.</p>

<p>One more important note, it is good to be deliberate with intentions. The helpers in this universe value free will immensely but are very willing to offer significant assistance if direct help is asked with a pure motive.</p>

<p>The results will manifest themselves and you don&#39;t need to worry about putting any pressure on yourself.</p>

<p>I hope this helps!</p>

<p>Love and Light</p>

<p>My friend wanted me to mention one last thing. The public has some significant misunderstanding about the Chakras. Most importantly, some of the colors are wrong. The color of the heart chakra is light blue, the color of the throat chakra is purple, the color of the third eye chakra is silver and the color of the crown chakra is gold. If you have no idea what we are talking about, we are working on a post about it so stay tuned!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Each day as you go through your life within this density and this experience, you bloom a little, you send out petals of anger, forgiveness, love, kindness, jealousy, and a hunger and thirst for that which is physical and that which is metaphysical. And all these things are to the Creator as flowers, delicate and beautiful, too insubstantial to pluck, but to be watched with great joy. You feel joy and the Creator feels joy; you feel hope and the Creator hopes again. All things that you feel are gifts, are your gifts to the one infinite Creator. Do you wish to give good gifts? Then decide in your mind that which is good, but never doubt that to the Creator you are beautiful, for all experience is beautiful for it is done in freedom, experienced in freedom and given freely back to the creation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The rainbow is still correct but it stops at the throat chakra. We are still trying to figure some of the more specific details, but each chakra is actually in 3 parts, occupying the same area but at a different vibration and different shade. So the Heart chakra, for example, has a green and blue together, creating a light blue/teal look. The third eye chakra has black and white, which creates the silver.

<p>My main concern is that the intentional and exponential degradation of the natural environment from many artificial human activities will place us all in the ground before the awakening can take place on a wide enough scale. Any thoughts on that?  Hopefully love will conquer all, take care! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A logical concern, yes. This is a tricky one to answer, because these things will certainly come to pass on a large scale in our lifetimes. There is more to it than just human activities, though. The rising vibrational level of the planet will be clashing more and more with the low vibrational levels taking place on the earths surface, and this <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/OccultConspiracy/comments/35obb5/continental_archetypes_the_thought_realm_and/">clash will manifest as unprecedented natural disasters</a>. </p>

<p>But that didn&#39;t answer the question at all, I think. I guess my answer would be along the lines of, I think the timeline for the awakening will take place exactly fast enough to turn the tide at the last moment. We are living in epic times, in an epic universe, and each person is going to have epic experiences before all is said and done. There is simultaneously divine design and free will in the events in our lives. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve always disliked the answer of &#39;faith&#39;, but this is a case where I simply just believe that love will prevail because that is the idea that synchronicity is leading me to. </p>

<p>Love and Light :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting.  This reminds me of that <a href="https://youtu.be/D7XwGBPLiAo?t=332">Star Trek episode</a> where they find this race of people who hunt down a certain group of people for being dangerous to society.  When all it was in the end was their species making the jump to their next level of evolutionary development in the form of pure energy.</p>

<p>Maybe autism is a weird evolutionary shift into a higher level of consciousness.  I guess if I were able to see other dimensions and peoples thoughts, I would probably seem disconnected with my surroundings too.  Imagine growing up like this as a child trying to interact with this world, and another, at the same time would be super crazy confusing.</p>

<p>I have always thought &quot;social anxiety&quot; isn&#39;t what it appears to be.  Maybe it&#39;s a form of telepathy where you go out in public and start to receive all these people&#39;s thoughts at once.  And not knowing where/why/what these feelings you are picking up on.  Why stage fright is paralyzing for some people because they are receiving a bunch of peoples focused thoughts and emotions at once.  It would be overwhelming.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>It is definitely something like this. My friend thinks that the souls of autistic people chose to incarnate outside of the &quot;control matrix&quot; (which I guess I could best describe as the energies and vibrations that keep our mind &quot;on track&quot;) for the purpose of bringing good energy and high vibrations to the planet. This is not something we are absolutely sure about, though.</p>

<p>You are absolutely right about the ability to receive thoughts. For most people it is entirely subconscious but it absolutely still affects the personality.</p>

<p>As per the Mayan Calendar, they were on to something. I, and many others, woke up to these truths on December 21, 2012.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First I want to express my sincere gratitude and appreciation for sharing this message. Everything that was said resonates with me and my entire being. I feel we have all had certain triggers that have led us to where we are now. We are collectively working together in this awakening process and the most beautiful thing about this is that we are ascending as a collective. This shift that is occurring is beyond words and any understanding. It is a feeling that we know in our hearts. And this wave is getting stronger with each passing day. Love and light. Peace be with you brothers and sisters. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Already back in 2005 or so I started getting messages in meditation sessions that state the same as is said here.  There were many more too.  When I&#39;ve told people in my sphere about these other things, they have all said that it&#39;s too much to expect a person to live that way, that it&#39;s too hard and they would never wish to do so.  I try to live as closely to those standards as I can, but it is very hard.  As a result of this, I have found myself without friends (which I actually don&#39;t mind this at all) and without the possibility of making new friends.  I&#39;m not in &quot;that world&quot; anymore and I can&#39;t/won&#39;t go back.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>WE vs them, me vs you, animen vs men.. </p>

<p>yet we are all made of love and light? How can you say one man is dark and the other is light? Do good and evil  truly exist? Surely all the horrible events that have happened recently, 9/11, WWII, natural disasters and all are shaping the world in unseen ways, there is a big plan, showing us all certain things about one another and moderating the world from more extreme events. All leaders appear to be the correct leaders for their countries at that time. Why is there antipathy towards these men when they are human beings? It is not what goes into your mouth that defiles you, rather what comes out of it. It&#39;s a truly wonderful place to be here, a unique place. To be an individual and to feel what it&#39;s like to be individual, with your own choices and feelings, to be yourself and to be free, to experience this, not immersed in unity and heavenly connection to one another, which understandably you can miss very much. Clearly we need to advance socially and not as much technologically, as we have enough of that.</p>

<p>From whence do you come? Do you know what will happen in the future? Will there be more disasters or just love? What does the &#39;&#39;awakening&#39;&#39; look like?? </p>

<p>thank you</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Serious question:  How do you communicate with him/her?  Can he/she speak?  Do you communicate in some other way?  Thank you.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Love and light is all that there is”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My friend is very fond of typing this. It is meant to be taken literally. Love and light, consciousness and energy, compose the very structure of the universe, from which all else manifests.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not here to be contrarian, but (in this dimension anyway) it seems one cannot have or appreciate love and light without also having an understanding of the opposing force.  It seems you cannot see or experience the one reality without the contrast of the other.  As such, it seems the yin (dark) is just as important, crucial, and necessary as the yang (light).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>once you understand that you are made of divine ingredients and grasp the power of creation that your consciousness contains, then this physical illusion CANNOT hurt you. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This seems correct enough, but I would say that the physical illusion of this existence seems to be that the dark is as much a thing to avoid as the light is a thing to attain or gravitate toward.  The objective is obviously <em>not</em> to go toward the dark, of course.  However, since it seems that one cannot have or even <em>know</em> light without also knowing and understanding the dark - and since the extent to which one appreciates the light seems gauged and dependent upon the extent to which one can also become aware of the dark - it therefore seems that if one wants to do away with the dark, one cannot do so without also going beyond (and doing away with) its opposite:  Light.</p>

<p>I would, of course, certainly hope and wish that I am wrong in this assessment, but I must say that it seems to at least logically follow that one cannot know “A” without having an equal understanding of “not A”.</p>

<p>If I am correct, therefore (and I fully grant that I may not be correct, but - again - the logical conclusions and progressions I am following do seem sound as far as I can tell), then it would seem that it isn’t so much the love and the light that one should be going for and striving for in their life, for (again), you cannot have and experience love and light without also knowing about and, consequently, experiencing its opposite as well.</p>

<p>The key, as such, is <em>transcendence</em> - transcending both darkness <em>and</em> light altogether.  If part of the motivation behind experiencing love and light involves making sure and NOT experiencing its polar opposite (darkness) and one <em>doesn’t</em> want to experience darkness, then it would seem that the best way to do away with even the possibility of experiencing the darkness…is to simply do away with both paradigms altogether…transcend <em>both</em> since you cannot have one without the other.</p>

<p>If I want no darkness, and I want no pain, and I wish to do away with whatever may even possibly lead to it or be associated with it, then it would seem I must do away with that which is intrinsically tied to it and that without which I cannot even <em>know</em> darkness at all:  Namely light.  Both must go.</p>

<p>If I want no darkness ever, then it would seem I must relinquish light as well.</p>

<p>As such, again, the real key to spiritual evolution and development is transcendence above and beyond both darkness <em>and</em> light.</p>

<p>All this being said, I just finished reading the rest of your OP, and I ultimately agree with you in the sense that it is <em>much</em> better to be going toward the love and light yang aspect of the dynamic/spectrum than the darkness/yin aspect of it.  Transcendence does indeed seem greater than Light/Yang, but Light/Yang seems ultimately better than Yin/darkness.</p>

<p>I like everything you have said about Yin. It gives us a lot to think about. We have been playing around with the idea of true darkness and false darkness, which I came across in a Manly P Hall pamphlet. True darkness being the womb of light, and false darkness being what we experience in this illusion.</p>

<p>I absolutely agree with your saying that we need to know darkness in order to know light. I&#39;ve experienced it in a micro fashion in my own life, periods of depression preceding periods of joy and development. On a global scale, this dark situation we find ourselves in is necessary for the awakening to develop. Experiencing and understanding evil so we can learn what we are <em>not</em>. </p>

<p>I guess that my difference is  that I would consider the necessary goal to be transmutation instead of transcendence. To not relinquish both, but to transmute the darkness into light. Paradoxically, this is the same as balancing the polarities, as an equal amount of light and darkness in a room, once balanced, will be a light room. That may be a little off, now that I think about it. </p>

<p>I have been reading a lot of occult literature and there are references to the black ray and the white ray that make up a part of our energy body. My friend says that these are located in the third eye chakra. I am thinking about transcending more, maybe it is indeed the step after transmutation of the black ray into light. I am not sure how to piece together the idea of true and false darkness into it, as I mentioned earlier. </p>

<p>The ultimate destination is to be at one with everything. What all does that entail? I&#39;m not sure! Someday we will find out.</p>

<p>Regardless, at risk of repeating myself, there is lots to think about! Thanks for the comment!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Hmmm.  Very interesting.  True darkness verses false darkness.  Which is which?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>True darkness being the womb of light, and false darkness being what we experience in this illusion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Beautifully-put, I would say.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve experienced it in a micro fashion in my own life, periods of depression preceding periods of joy and development. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  Certainly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On a global scale, this dark situation we find ourselves in is necessary for the awakening to develop. Experiencing and understanding evil so we can learn what we are <em>not</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You basically said in two concise sentences what I spent hundreds of words (if not more) explaining <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/14utv0/911_was_an_occult_megaritual_the_numbers_of_the_4/c7gwqaz">here</a>.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Again, beautifully-put.  Thanks for getting me to understand it in this way.  Very much appreciated indeed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Paradoxically, this is the same as balancing the polarities, as an equal amount of light and darkness in a room, once balanced, will be a light room.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As such, much light is not light only, but the proper mixture of yin and yang - light and darkness.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That may be a little off, now that I think about it. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m not sure it is actually.  A room illuminated by a 20 watt bulb will shine quite differently than a room illuminated by a 100 watt bulb…than a room with a 1000 watt bulb.  The mixture of the light and darkness illuminates the surroundings differently, but in each case…the room will be <em>lit</em>.</p>

<p>This is actually quite a brilliant metaphor/example you gave (all pun intended, perhaps).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have been reading a lot of occult literature and there are references to the black ray and the white ray that make up a part of our energy body.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems we are definitely both, and I am not super sure if we can be anything <em>but</em> both while we remain in this dimension.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am not sure how to piece together the idea of true and false darkness into it, as I mentioned earlier. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think your bulb example was (again) quite brilliant actually, and shows just how both are really different parts of the very same spectrum.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The ultimate destination is to be at one with everything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It would seem such.  Yes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What all does that entail? I&#39;m not sure!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m not sure that I have any idea either at this juncture.  :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Someday we will find out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It would seem so.  Yes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Regardless, at risk of repeating myself, there is lots to think about! Thanks for the comment!</p>

<p>Ha.  Very well of you to say this, and very appreciated.  I ultimately said the very thing and came to a similar conclusion in my response to OP on this issue:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/377gbe/love_and_light/crl2nht">both are really different parts of the very same spectrum.</a></p>

<p>However, your reiterating it here is, again, appreciated.  Thank you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>maybe Light and Darkness are the same thing, just seen from different perspectives. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Very well-said.  Thank you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Similarly, there is no opposite of Love, because Love is all there is.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This would seem very correct.  The catch, however?  The catch seems to be that Love really and truly is something that is much greater and grander than we can really understand and fathom at this point in our spiritual existence and evolution.  Much of what Love truly is we - in our current less-than-developed state - often experience as and call the <em>opposite</em> of Love.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We&#39;re taught that the opposite of Love is hatred or fear, but aren&#39;t both of those just misguided Love (perhaps of self, another being, tribe, country, etc.) expressed in a way that does not understand that we are all connected? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No idea who you are, but if we were in person right now, I would give you a <em>really</em> big hug.  Very well-said.  Beautifully-put.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It seems to me that when we allow our own perspective to become wide enough, we begin to see that everything is really the same. </p>

<p>Could not agree more, and thank you for coming here and offering your perspective.  It definitely helped me to see things from a better enriched perspective.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This sort of spirituality is always so baseless and anthrocentric, it&#39;s not really a step better than run of the mill religion, holding back the rational development of our species. </p>

<p>For what reason or even how would the universe exist for &#39;beauty consciousness love&#39; specifically trying to &#39;raise vibrations of conscious beings&#39; as opposed to an emergent phenomena of atomic interactions? Why would there be an entire race of entities whose purpose is torment humans, and cause suffering on those types of processes that can perceive it?</p>

<p>It is a bit like saying the entire purpose of this reality is for higher beings to spread misery among plants by eating, uprooting, and deforesting them. Which, if plants could speak, are the sorts of stories I&#39;m sure they would tell each other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright.</p>

<p>Negative experiences aren&#39;t entirely bad because they&#39;re part of what makes you develop as a person. Even as much as we think we know, there is still the other 99.99° of our Universe (let alone whatever else makes up existence in the physical plane) so there&#39;s still so much more to learn, do, see, experience, etc. This isn&#39;t all there is to existing. Lots of stuff that you can learn from doesn&#39;t suck, so it&#39;s not all bad. </p>

<p>Then he goes a little metaphysical and kind of not only suggests some sort of &quot;soul&quot; situation (for lack of a better term), but also posits that before your existence here on earth, you decided to be here and go through this process (of existing in this form, going through these things, doing whatever, etc.). </p>

<p>He ends on a positive note saying &quot;Shit&#39;s gon&#39; be fine and we&#39;ll get through this and be better-ish for it (individually and collectively, it seems)&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>Better?</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>The question:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For what reason or even how would the universe exist for &#39;beauty consciousness love&#39; specifically trying to &#39;raise vibrations of conscious beings&#39; as opposed to an emergent phenomena of atomic interactions? Why would there be an entire race of entities whose purpose is torment humans, and cause suffering on those types of processes that can perceive it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The &quot;answer&quot;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Its all about learning experiences. Suffering and darkness leads to growth. We are experiencing one small section of an infinite grand universe with infinitely different types of existence. Many areas are joyful, silly, fun and entertaining. But we chose this type of experience with a dense physical illusion so we can develop. And develop we will, when these events begin to culminate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your clarification:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Negatives help you grow and the universe is big.  Metaphysics, hope.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am actually <em>extremely</em> confused as to how you think this answers the question.  To me the answers and clarifications seem completely irrelevant - not entirely wrong necessarily, but just not even an attempt to answer the question.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes I feel like a shift has already happened. Except there is this game being played out in our reality that makes it seem as if it has not. It is like we&#39;re being astroturfed into thinking that the experience of the shift is a dream, or not real, or a figment of our imagination. But the more I pay attention to it, the more unreal the &quot;real&quot; world seems. Kinda how my username came to be... blinded by lights. The more I immerse into the light of what I perceive, the more blinded I am to the astroturf game. It&#39;s really a weird experience. And as I try to get back into the &quot;real&quot; world, the more I just can&#39;t. I am kind of being forced into creating reality from a different ruleset. I&#39;ve followed the Seth material for decades, so that helps. But yes to meditation, and yes yes to getting out in nature and out of our &quot;boxes&quot; and away from screens. The trees in the forests seem to be aware of the shift much more than we are. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve put a lot of thought into this comment. Some great insights. </p>

<p>My friend has been saying that there are increments of a shift happening, but small, and that a major event will culminate and complete the transition. We&#39;re not sure about anything though, we&#39;ve come to the realization that many of his &quot;visions&quot; are not necessarily directly seeing the future but could have many other purposes. </p>

<p>My own consciousness is absolutely changing, but I am wondering how much is directly related to all of the secrets of the universe I am learning versus some external change in vibration (likely both). </p>

<p>Message me if you start experiencing a more tangible shift. My friend would like to hear about it.</p>

<p>&quot;Do The Work; The Work Is Love&quot;</p>

<p>For indeed that is all we can do. The systems that bind us to the order supported by the dark ones, the systems that keep us tied to this plane as spiritual beings inhabiting a physical/energy body, can be transcended through the power of Love to rewire the circuts that generate our unique conscious experience and allow us to experience our True nature. By realizing this we deprive Them of the control they have over us, and the power they get from that control. Peace, brother, and good luck on your journey. Love and Light, indeed.</p>

<p>He declares that he can read minds, access to collective knowledge and past experiences... but aren&#39;t we individuals? is our individuality damned to be collective? is there any privacy or your friend would be a judge from such universal knowledge? This collective civilization is natural for humans or it comes from somewhere else?</p>

<p>About the awakening... is this knowledge the actual &quot;awakening&quot;? What&#39;s the final purpose of this?</p>

<p>Can I contact you or your friend on PM?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I discussed how my friend&#39;s experiences can be explained without violating individuality. Thoughts give off a vibration just like speech, although the vibrations of thoughts are much more subtle. We all have the ability to pick up these vibrations, but for the most part for us they are subconscious. </p>

<p>I did not discuss that I do in fact believe that the true nature of consciousness is unity, but I&#39;ll put that here in this comment. Individuality of consciousness is very beneficial at this level for the mass learning of experience, but evolution to higher levels of being will slowly dissolve the individuality, beginning first with the free communication of thought.</p>

<p>About the awakening, knowledge on this level is building the foundation. The true awakening will manifest in various concurrent ways, the awakening of psychic faculties, the awakening of our internal energy centers, the return of love to dominate our consciousness, the understanding of our place in the universe (as individual aspects of the consciousness of God), the understanding of the purpose of our existence. And lastly, the transmutation of evil and darkness into love and light, through our collective will. </p>

<p>Hope this helped!</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also been told that I&#39;m an Indigo Child (I&#39;m an adult now - born after 1979, though). Does this concept fit in with the &#39;Awakening&#39; at all?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I have! It has been over two years since I have read the Hidden Hand dialogue, but I remember feeling that it is over 50% truth, and that many of the most important parts resonated with me (there is disinfo, given the nature of the source). I plan on reading it again soon.</p>

<p>The Ra Material I absolutely love. I think that, once you scrape off all of the talk about ancient aliens and intergalactic civilizations, it is a true statement of the nature of reality and our universe. My friend says the source is angels. I also love their research archives:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.llresearch.org/library.aspx">http://www.llresearch.org/library.aspx</a></p>

<p>It is a little less dense and they channel different beings, and it is also less specific, but it is, well, simply beautiful words.</p>

<p>So yes, they do correlate with my beliefs. In my research I draw from three main groups of information:</p>

<p>Western Occultism</p>

<p>Eastern Mysticism</p>

<p>Channellings</p>

<p>They each have their importance and I am trying to build them all together for one grand unifying theory I guess I would say. The channellings are the most important for understanding our purpose, the rest are how to maneuver within the illusion.</p>

<p>As far as Indigo Child, I&#39;ll have to ask my friend about that term. We haven&#39;t decided exactly what to think with that term and &quot;wanderers&quot; but there are definitely people here for a purpose of helping others and being leaders.</p>

<p>Let me  give you one source, about 50 pages long, and see if it sparks your interest.</p>

<p><a href="http://sacred-texts.com/eso/kyb/index.htm">http://sacred-texts.com/eso/kyb/index.htm</a></p>

<p>This is the <em>Kybalion</em>, written a century ago by a member of an esoteric society (possibly Franz Bardon). It is a discussion of the laws of the universe as seen by various occult groups that date back millennia to Ancient Egypt (can be corroborated by ancient texts such as the Emerald Tablet). If you dig it, then I can lay a lot more materials on the table, and if you don&#39;t, at least you learned about an interesting philosophy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe &quot;soon&quot; when comparing time to the universal scale, but this rock is a complete fucking mess right now. IMO we&#39;re still several generations from any sort of Renaissance. I am pretty big on the topics of metaphysics, persistence of consciousness, spirits but not tied to religion - so I appreciate the sentiment, but lots of the love and light stuff is rather impractical to fixing what ails the globe. 100 prayer / positive intention / manifestation warriors vs 100 modern storm troopers is like fighting a forest fire with marshmallows.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is nothing any external agent can do that cannot ultimately be better achieved 100 times over through the use of ones own, focused, <em>sober</em> mental-emotional-spiritual assertion.  Indeed anything <em>other</em> than the use of one&#39;s own sober focus and intent ultimately adds one more shackle upon the crutch of one&#39;s dependence on that external agent, which binds you further down to the <em>opposite</em> of what you are trying to achieve.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your words, friend :)</p>

<p>I have read that comment before, when you posted it, and I love it! Back then I was <a href="/u/lawofattraction33">/u/lawofattraction33</a>, though I mostly lurked with the exception of a couple posts.</p>

<p>There is so much work to be done, and I&#39;m grateful you are helping lead the way.</p>

<p>Namaste</p>
