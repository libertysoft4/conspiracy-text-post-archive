        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Clarification needs to be created regarding VACCINATION vs. IMMUNIZATION.  I’m all for immunization.  The problem created by media and pharmaceutical influence is that people equate immunization with vaccination.  Vaccination is simply injecting something into your body.  This does not create immunity for your body.  These are 2 totally separate entities.</p>

<p>Another thing that irks me is my ‘mom’s’ comments about me leaving out stuff and therefore destroying my credibility.   I would like to add I make ZERO money off of this blog.  I may book some speaking gigs from it but those revenues will come nowhere near the $20 BILLION per year the makers of vaccines cherish.  Who do you think has more weight on their shoulders to hide information?  Huh, mom?  Huh?</p>

<p>With building immunity, it’s a natural process.  With that natural process, your body uses many defenses.  The first layer of defense is your skin.  This blocks out any harmful opportunistic buggers.  With a vaccine, this law of nature is totally bypassed by injecting you with a needle full of stuff your skin would never allow past it.</p>

<p>You also have a respiratory system that also aids in defense.  You cough, you sneeze, and you blow your nose, in attempt to expel the potential invader.  Coughing, sneezing, and snorting are results of your immune system working.  Don’t suppress it with fever reducers, anti-histamines, etc.  You’re just making it easier for the invader.</p>

<p>You also have your gut-associated lymph system to fight with the stronger stuff.  If your system is so deficient to get past these natural defenses,  the potential invader, live or dead, enters the blood stream.  Once something is in your blood stream, it can be transported any anywhere in your body, not good at all.  It’s like open bar at a chiropractic convention.</p>

<p>A vaccine violates all laws of natural immune defenses by taking a potential pathogen along with all the TOXIC ingredients(aluminum, formaldehyde, adjuvants, etc) directly into your blood system.  This process would never occur in building natural immunity.  That last sentence is kind of an oxy-moron.  Immunity is a natural thing.  Vaccines are an artificial thing.</p>

<p>FLAWED RESEARCH:</p>

<p>The scientific mantra of vaccines is that they are safe and effective based on their research.  Their research is flawed and is a double standard from any other drug product studied.  The Gold Standard in research design is the double blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT).</p>

<p>This means that people are split into 2 groups randomly and participants are given either the real thing or the fake thing being tested.  Then progress is charted on who gets better, who gets worse, and the like.  In theory there should be no bias as to reporting because the researchers don’t know who is in the placebo or the real intervention group.</p>

<p>How many vaccines have ever been studied in this manner?  ZERO!  The reason?  The researchers will say they cannot perform an RCT because it would be unethical to NOT give a child a vaccine because if that child dies of something that could have been prevented, then they don’t want to be responsible.  But if someone dies in their trials from taking their anti-depressants, it must be OK.</p>

<p>Hey drug companies, I will volunteer my child to be in the placebo group and compare him to the health and well being of those that have gotten all the recommended vaccines.  I’m sure I can gather a few hundred thousand more to be in the placebo group to create a large sample.</p>

<p>Instead of research to see safety and effectiveness, they instead see if the person builds anti-bodies to the antigen (the foreign invader) that is in the vaccine.  If antibodies are built, then it’s ‘safe and effective,’ or so they lead us to believe.  These studies are rarely, if ever done on kids younger than 4 years old.  How can you say it’s safe or effective for a baby if it’s never studied on a baby?</p>

<p>The 2 populations that have limited production of anti-bodies are infants and geriatrics, the 2 most heavily vaccinated populations.  If they can’t produce anti-bodies, then the vaccine would be pointless.  The whole premise of the vaccine is that you get injected with a foreign invader and you produce anti-bodies against it.  If you can’t produce anti-bodies well then what’s the use of injecting something to try and stimulate that reaction?</p>

<p>With kids, they don’t produce any anybodies until after age 6 months.  So why give a vaccine to anyone under the age of 6 months if they can’t produce antibodies.  Even if the whole vaccine theory really worked, it would be absolutely pointless to inject a baby of 6 months or less with a vaccine .  With a child’s immune system being very immature until age 2, the overload of 36 vaccines by the age of 18 months seems about as logical as drinking from a fire hydrant.</p>

<p>BOOSTER BUST:  </p>

<p>This is another aspect to the junk science of vaccines that exposes kids only 18 months old to 36 shots.  In their research of efficacy (how long something will work), they have no idea.  For this reason, we have multiple shots for multiple antigens.  Just take the latest HPV vaccine, the 3 series shot given to 12 year old girls to prevent HPV (an STD) which “MIGHT” but has never been confirmed, contribute to cervical cancer.</p>

<p>The manufacturer is only claiming 5 years of efficacy.  The problem with this is 2 fold.  1. The average age of cervical cancer is 50.  2. The shot is administered to 12 year old girls.
So we have a system pushing multiple shots (boosters) with a supposed 5 year efficacy timeline onto pre-teen girls, that was never tested on them, for a disease that has an average age of 50.  You give it a 12 year old and by the time she’s 17 the effects are worn off and then you claim you can prevent cervical cancer as they get older.  And I’m the quack for speaking out against vaccines.</p>

<p>So what are the efficacy rates of other vaccines?  Who knows?  They don’t study that, they assume and say we need more.  Once the vaccine is FDA approved and on the market, there’s no need to put any more money into it to study the effects.  Instead, we have a test tube of 4 million new subjects each and every year where they can just sit back, relax and never worry about a law suit because the government has protected them from any and all liability.</p>

<p>Since no studies go into how long the vaccine would last, then there can be an endless recommendation of potential booster shots.  The part that really confuses me are the shots that are 4 part series.  If the first 3 didn’t confirm immunity, how do we know that the last shot was ‘the one’ that provides lifetime immunity?  Why would the 2nd to last shot be good for only a year but the last one be good for an entire lifetime?  That’s pretty arrogant and sketchy logic.</p>

<p>POLIO PUSHERS:</p>

<p>If I were to ask you what polio looks like, you probably have images of wheel chairs, crutches and kids limping around.  You would be absolutely correct…less than 0.5-2% of the time.  I want to make it clear that I am not downplaying the devastation of that 2%.  The point I’m making, hopefully it’s clear enough, is that I am making decisions based on statistics not emotion. As a parent, it’s very hard to separate the two sometimes.</p>

<p>In over 95% of the time, polio presents with the following symptoms: slight fever, malaise, headache, sore throat, and vomiting.  These start 3-5 days after exposure and recovery is 24-72 hours with a result of lifetime immunity.  Bet you never heard that from your pharma influenced media or doctor?</p>

<p>In fact, if you went to your doctor with those symptoms and you were told you had polio, you would leave his office laughing and write bad reviews on his Google Places page.
The remaining 3% was non-paralytic polio.  This presented for 2-10 days as high fever, severe headache, stiff neck, hyperesthesia/paresthesia in extremities and some asymmetrical limb weakness.  Take this list of symptoms to your doctor and you will probably get a label of meningitis, not polio.</p>

<p>But Dr. Kurt, the vaccine saved all those people from getting the paralyzing version.  If you look at the charts below, you will see that Polio was already massively decreasing prior to any vaccine ever introduced.  I would also like to add that the highest incidence came at a time our country was in despair (poor sanitation, hygiene, nutrition) during the depression.</p>

<p>It was a time where sanitation was poor, hygiene was poor, and nutrition was poor.  These are the reasons that third world countries have problems with communicable diseases, not lack of vaccines.  As the Great Depression was clearing up, people were living cleaner and healthier and there was also the introduction of a drug class called antibiotics that was given for any sniffle, cough, or fever.</p>

<p>The last natural case of polio in the US was 1979, yet we still give kids 4 rounds of this vaccine at 2, 4, 6-12 months, and 4-6 years.  But the fear tactics continue of, “it can come back or you don’t know about the destruction it caused.”  I’m not being ignorant to history.  I’m being reasonable about the present.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is not something we even need sources for, it&#39;s basic vaccine science, check out the vaccine inserts and you&#39;ll see that only a % will develop immunity post-vaccination, that means a vaccination is not an immunization.

<p>No one said vaccines are 100% effective and that there were no possible side effects.</p>

<p>So, your answer is to expose everyone to all diseases when they are young, to be immune later in life?</p>

<p>A rational person weighs the available information and sees risk of death from preventable diseases is higher than risk of complications from vaccines.</p>

<p>Most healthy older children and adults fully recover, however those with comorbid conditions have a higher risk of morbidity and mortality.</p>

<p>Infection in newborns is particularly severe. Pertussis is fatal in an estimated 1.6% of hospitalized US infants under one year of age.[31] First year infants are also more likely to develop complications, such as: pneumonia (20%), encephalopathy (0.3%), seizures (1%), failure to thrive and death (1%)[31]—perhaps due to the ability of the bacterium to suppress the immune system.[32] Pertussis can cause severe paroxysm-induced cerebral hypoxia and 50% of infants admitted to hospital suffer apneas.[31] Reported fatalities from pertussis in infants increased substantially from 1990-2010.[33]</p>

<p>Measles can kill.</p>

<p>The majority of people survive measles, though in some cases, complications may occur. Possible consequences of measles virus infection include bronchitis, sensorineural hearing loss,[24] and—in about 1 in 10,000-1 in 300,000 cases[49]—panencephalitis, which is usually fatal.[50] Acute measles encephalitis is another serious risk of measles virus infection. It typically occurs two days to one week after the breakout of the measles rash and begins with very high fever, severe headache, convulsions and altered mentation. A person with measles encephalitis may become comatose, and death or brain injury may occur.[51]</p>

<p>There is no treatment for polio and it can kill or paralyze.</p>

<p>Treatment</p>

<p>There is no cure for polio. The focus of modern treatment has been on providing relief of symptoms, speeding recovery and preventing complications. Supportive measures include antibiotics to prevent infections in weakened muscles, analgesics for pain, moderate exercise and a nutritious diet.[59] Treatment of polio often requires long-term rehabilitation, including occupational therapy, physical therapy, braces, corrective shoes and, in some cases, orthopedic surgery.[42]</p>

<p>Portable ventilators may be required to support breathing. Historically, a noninvasive, negative-pressure ventilator, more commonly called an iron lung, was used to artificially maintain respiration during an acute polio infection until a person could breathe independently (generally about one to two weeks). Today, many polio survivors with permanent respiratory paralysis use modern jacket-type negative-pressure ventilators worn over the chest and abdomen.[60]</p>

<p>Other historical treatments for polio include hydrotherapy, electrotherapy, massage and passive motion exercises, and surgical treatments, such as tendon lengthening and nerve grafting.[14]</p>

<p>Prognosis</p>

<p>A child with a deformity of her right leg due to polio
Patients with abortive polio infections recover completely. In those who develop only aseptic meningitis, the symptoms can be expected to persist for two to ten days, followed by complete recovery.[61] In cases of spinal polio, if the affected nerve cells are completely destroyed, paralysis will be permanent; cells that are not destroyed, but lose function temporarily, may recover within four to six weeks after onset.[61] Half the patients with spinal polio recover fully; one-quarter recover with mild disability, and the remaining quarter are left with severe disability.[62] The degree of both acute paralysis and residual paralysis is likely to be proportional to the degree of viremia, and inversely proportional to the degree of immunity.[35] Spinal polio is rarely fatal.[36]</p>

<p>Without respiratory support, consequences of poliomyelitis with respiratory involvement include suffocation or pneumonia from aspiration of secretions.[60] Overall, 5–10% of patients with paralytic polio die due to the paralysis of muscles used for breathing. The case fatality rate (CFR) varies by age: 2–5% of children and up to 15–30% of adults die.[1] Bulbar polio often causes death if respiratory support is not provided;[43] with support, its CFR ranges from 25 to 75%, depending on the age of the patient.[1][63] When intermittent positive pressure ventilation is available, the fatalities can be reduced to 15%.[64]</p>

<p>As for the last paragraph, here is the actual, information.</p>

<p>The last cases of naturally occurring paralytic polio in the United States were in 1979, when an outbreak occurred among the Amish in several Midwestern states. From 1980 through 1999, there were 162 confirmed cases of paralytic polio cases reported. Of the 162 cases, eight cases were acquired outside the United States and imported. The last imported case caused by wild poliovirus into the United States was reported in 1993. The remaining 154 cases were vaccine-associated paralytic polio (VAPP) caused by live oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV).</p>

<p>What kind of polio vaccines are used in the United States?</p>

<p>IPV, which is given as a shot, is now used in the United States. OPV has not been used in the United States since 2000 but is still used in many parts of the world</p>

<p>&quot;With kids, they don’t produce any anybodies until after age 6 months.&quot; This is a lie. The truth.</p>

<p>Immediately after birth, the newborn has high levels of the mother&#39;s antibodies in the bloodstream. Babies who are breastfed continue to receive antibodies via breast milk. Breast milk contains all five types of antibodies, including immunoglobulin A (IgA), immunoglobulin D (IgD), immunoglobulin E (IgE), IgG, and immunoglobulin M (IgM). This is called passive immunity because the mother is &quot;passing&quot; her antibodies to her child. This helps prevent the baby from developing diseases and infections.</p>

<p>During the next several months, the antibodies passed from the mother to the infant steadily decrease. When healthy babies are about two to three months old, the immune system will start producing its own antibodies. During this time, the baby will experience the body&#39;s natural low point of antibodies in the bloodstream. This is because the maternal antibodies have decreased, and young children, who are making antibodies for the first time, produce them at a much slower rate than adults.</p>

<p>Once healthy babies reach six months of age, their antibodies are produced at a normal rate.</p>
