<p>That&#39;s the thing that gets me. I believe the planes could&#39;ve been swapped out with reinforced military planes and flown as drones. But, what the hell happened to the passengers if this was the case? What do you think? Did they go undercover, paid off, witness protection, or killed?</p>

Upto that speed (vd+20%) you know you wont get flutter and crash.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>Seemingly harmless question:</p>

<p>Is flying that plane <em>really</em> that hard? Isn&#39;t that another fact we should research?
For example, I found that <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_certification_in_the_United_States">it only takes 1500 hours of pilot time logged to fly airlines</a>. This would infer that they&#39;d been capable of flying in that first hour, having survived to complete the commercial qualifications.</p>

<p>Taken a step further, in 2001 humans had been sharpening their skills in flight simulators for at least a decade as video games. My school had them in 1994, for example. </p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure I could have flown the damn thing at 13 years old, having already been in the air and not needing to land...</p>

Upto that speed (vd+20%) you know you wont get flutter and crash.
Above it..you might. Flying on the knife edge gave them maximum speed and zero crash risk . ( dont want any embarrassing wreckage and old mine pits for planes to disappear into arent just anywhere).</p>

And once they saw that those operatives would be reveiled, the order was given to fire for the first time that day.

    <div class="md"><p>From <a href="http://www.askthepilot.com/questionanswers/conspiracy-nation/">http://www.askthepilot.com/questionanswers/conspiracy-nation/</a> :</p>

<p>Reality: The cabal’s feats did not require in-depth technical knowledge or a high degree of skill.  The attackers, as private pilots, were completely out of their league in the cockpits of those 757s and 767s; however they were not setting out to perform single-engine missed approaches or Category-3 instrument landings with a failed hydraulic system – or to land at all.  They were setting out to steer an already airborne jetliner, in perfect weather, into the side of a building.  Though, for good measure, Mohammed Atta and at least one other member of his group did buy several hours of simulator training on a Boeing 727 (this was not the same type of jet used in the attacks, but it didn’t need to be).  Additionally they obtained manuals and instructional videos for the 757 and 767, available from aviation supply shops.</p>

<p>Hani Hanjour’s flying was exceptional only in its recklessness.  If anything, his loops and spirals above the nation’s capital revealed him to be exactly the shitty pilot he by all accounts was.  To hit the Pentagon squarely he needed only a bit of luck, and he got it.  Striking a stationary object — even a large one with five beckoning sides — at high speed and from a steep angle is very difficult.  To make the job easier, he came in obliquely, tearing down light poles as he roared across the Pentagon’s lawn.  If he’d flown the same profile ten times, seven of them he’d probably have tumbled short of the target or overflown it entirely.
As for those partisan pilots known to chime in on websites, take them with a grain of salt.  As somebody who flies 757 and 767s for a living, I think my testimony carries some weight.  Ask around and you’ll discover that the majority of professional pilots feel the way I do.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Air Blackwater,” previously known as Aviation Worldwide Services, formed in early 2001, just when the 911 hijackers were in the final stages of training. Public statements said they were to provide “military training operations and aviation transport” for the U.S. government. AWS was then acquired by Blackwater in 2003, as the Iraqi occupation was getting under way... Evergreen International, an aviation company whose board includes the former head of the CIA’s air operations, has taken over management of Pinal<br/>
operation confirmed that Evergreen had a close working relationship with the firm PTech, a firm with connections to the Saudi royal family and Israel’s Mossad and which had contracts to provide computer software support to the Department of Defense, Federal Aviation Administration, Department of Justice, FBI, and the Secret Service from 1997 until 9/11. The firm continues to provide software support for classified U.S. military projects.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyways, there&#39;s no direct evidence of the CIA training them but they were funded directly by Saud officials who had connections to officials in the US. Also I once read long ago that the hijackers lived across the street from the CIA or something, not to mention that they were frequently given information that Al-Qaeda members were getting training... So it&#39;s more than fair to say that the CIA heavily facilitated the training</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it was mossad agents living across the street in florida</p>

<p>i personally think all of the dirty work was handled by the mossad, disappearing the original flights, wiring the buildings, piloting with joysticks, etc.</p>

<p>but saudi arabia was responsible for providing the patsies, and bush sr. and murdoch controlled the cover up.</p>

<p>this same alliance is obviously behind isis, as well as the recent revolts in arab countries, terrorism in iran, and who knows what else.</p>

<p>but the plan was to strengthen israel and saudi arabia and keep the oil and weapons flowing, and to recreate all their least favorite regimes with client states like egypt where followers of islam can be controlled.</p>

<p>if they hadnt done 911 and these things, isis would still have happened but they wouldnt be in control.</p>

<p>its the biggest cabal in the history of the wirld and if you join the us military thats who will sign your check.</p>

<p>cant find the source anymore, all i see is the no plane testimony</p>

<p>Here you have pilots with unarmed jetfighters who wanted to crash into the hijacked planes when passengers got control back on the plane? why crash a plane not hijacked anymore?, to not leave any trace, instead, crashing the jetfighter into the no longer hijacked plane wasnt needed because the innexperienced passenger pilots crashed it into the ground leaving no trace of the plane whatsoever beacuse of the angle it flew into the ground, almost vertical, the plane desintegrated, sources claims...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What? When did this become about remote control? I was talking about the cell calls, which are different from airphone calls... Remote control is a possibility, I&#39;m open to pondering it but don&#39;t believe it entirely... What do you want right now? Do you just want to feel like you&#39;re right and you beat me or do you w want to consider possibilities? This is why I hate these conversations. People just want to feel good about themselves. I feel like you just searched &quot;911 cell phone calls debunk&quot; and parroted whatever came up without really considering if it makes sense to what I was talking about... either that or you don&#39;t know the difference between a cell phone and an airphone. Alright man, peace out. This is dumb. I am confident in my knowledge and thoughts because I&#39;ve read many different sources and differing sources. Think what you want, I hope some passerby see&#39;s the things I&#39;ve mentioned and actually looks into them more than just searching for a debunk and stopping there because the debunks leave out quite a bit.

    <div class="md"><p>Well my opinion is that they are part of the evidence that some parts of 911 were staged or allowed to happen... The remote control thing is one possibility. I personally think they were probably the real passengers but that the calls weren&#39;t made in the air. IMO those people are either dead or living in witness protection. There a many things can be evidence for modded planes or drones. Honestly, I could even disregard all of that. The simple thing is that buildings don&#39;t fall through themselves like that. The insider trading, the saudis selling airline stock a week ahead of time, the insurance policies, the calls, the failure of air defense, the excercises happening that day, the FBI and CIA disregarding warnings... all of that is just a distraction in the long run. Buildings don&#39;t collapse like that without something getting rid of the resistance in the floors below. At the very least we should have seen people fired for the absolute failure of 911, but no, we saw the promoted if anything.</p>

<p>BTW I would take your own advice. I&#39;ve been researching 911 since I was 12 and I&#39;ve changed my opinion a few times. I remember everything about that day and I look at all evidence, for and against my current opinion. I am always trying to learn. I determine what is true and what is not...what makes sense, what doesn&#39;t. Whats possible and what isn&#39;t. I&#39;m done with this you&#39;re honestly pissing me off. You&#39;re pretentious and just assume that I am unread and uneducated. When I mention things you don&#39;t really even look into it and you try to find one sentence out of it all to dissect and discredit. If you really care to know, then look into it. If you don&#39;t then it&#39;s not worth my time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I have time I&#39;ll find it, but you could find it on your own. There&#39;s not just one source, read a few, read differing opinions and go with what makes sense. I think the Calls themselves are iffy. There&#39;s also a flight attendent that wrote a book about all of the things that make no sense about the Calls, procedures, stuardesses calling the front desk instead of correct numbers. Reporting that hijackers are upstairs when there are no stairs, etc.... There&#39;s tons of stuff apart from that,. the speed of the planes for example, insider ttrading, Saudis selling American airline stock 5 days before, highjackers missing from all but one security camera....tons of oddities.</p>

<p>If that sounds plausible, look at the amazing maneuvers the pilot that allegedly slammed the plane into the Pentagon would have had to pull off.</p>
