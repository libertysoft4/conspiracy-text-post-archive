        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>They rave and rave about how much they love hard working citizens. People frown upon you if you say you don&#39;t want to work hard. All this work that people do, and sit on their high horses about, is driving an economy that is killing our earth. Its driving a system that supports israel no matter what and labels human beings &quot;terrorists&quot; before exterminating them. They have convinced the world that killing in the name of capitalism is acceptable and everyone else is a terrorist. It is sickening how blinded people have become. And yet, the goverment just wants you to &quot;work hard&quot;. &quot;working hard&quot; will make you feel good about yourself. But you are contributing to the destruction of life on earth. The only way to break the system is if people were to refuse to cooperate en masse. Until that happens, the world is going to keep getting worse and worse. By doing what David Cameron or Obama or whoever wants you do and dutifully working, you are ensuring this system stays in place. </p>

<p>Think twice about the morals of working. ITS ABOUT WHO YOU ARE WORKING FOR, work in itself is not a good thing</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my opinion it&#39;s the same problem with people saying &quot;we need more jobs&quot;. No, a job is just fulfilling a purpose, a means to an end so to speak.</p>

<p>What we really need is not &quot;hard workers&quot; but smarter systems and a better distribution of resources that doesn&#39;t put a few people (80 billionaires) elevated to god status while the people actually working in thier factories/offices/stores get the scraps left on the table.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like the recent debate about the 15 dollar an hour minimum wage that a lot of workers in the 12 to 15 dollar hour tier don&#39;t want, because they see prices as rising and their schooling/experience meaning jack shit when any high schooler can work at mcdonalds for 15 bucks an hour.</p>

<p>The problem is they are both wrong. Everyone should have a standard of living of around 100k a year or even higher. We could accomplish this without higher prices or serious economic problems. All that we need to do is tax the rich back to what 1950s levels are, and reinvest the money in the economy. That and slash military spending about 50%.</p>

<p>But what is good for the average person is not good for the &quot;owners&quot; which is why things are going the way they are now. </p>

<p>People are propagandized to see &quot;wealth redistribution&quot; and &quot;socialism&quot; as bad or &quot;communist&quot; but in reality it&#39;s how things were in the 50s/60s, the reason things are so bad now is because unregulated capitalism quickly turns the country/planet into the owners, and the serfs. Which is where we are at now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not having a philosophical conversation about the human condition...  I&#39;m saying that if you start a &quot;group&quot;, or go searching for a group, you&#39;ll either get in trouble with the praetorians or you&#39;ll get taken advantage of by a shadow interest.  Yes, humans are cooperative animals.  The change should come on an individual level tho.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I think of future civilizations, I imagine that they get to a point where every citizen no longer has to worry about their basic survival needs and can instead focus on what they are passionate about, something that could be considered &quot;work&quot; but is done for free because it is its own reward.</p>

<p>I think if you give people everything they need to survive for free, they would get bored of sitting around and would want to occupy their time doing something they like to do. Their &quot;work&quot; would look more like play.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah if people had their lives free i&#39;m sure most people wouldn&#39;t sit around doing nothing. People would work on their own projects and follow their own passions. It wouldn&#39;t be a world without work, it would be a world where work is wonderful and joyful and essentially the same as play. I think Karl Marx talks about this, an ideal job is one which allows you to put your own personality into what to you. For instance its far more satisfying for a craftsman to craft a chair than it is for a factory worker to follow explicit rules to fabricate a chair. </p>

A nice blend makes it easier for those that wish to partake. Though I hope they don&#39;t drown in it like koolaid, as I was simply offering a glass of water. As for labor, that&#39;s a good thing. It&#39;s the wage differental, the 1000:1 ratios (and those are kind, some are waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay higher) from boss to not bottom, but average employee, that is grotesque. And only through using the system our forefathers did will we fix it. This whole, &quot;just quit, that&#39;ll show em&quot; doesn&#39;t work. I know because I tried that protest. You know what happens? Nothing, because they don&#39;t give a fuck you quit, and while you are &quot;quit&quot;, they keep the machine going.

    <div class="md"><p>the thing is, in this day and age, our productivity is so incredibly high compared to past generations, that enough essential supplies could easily be produced for everyone with very little work. There is no need for armies of peasant workers. Whereas throughout history we worked to produce what we need, now we could produce what we need with very little effort at all. There is already a massive global food surplus.
We&#39;ve just been convinced we need much much more. For instance, we&#39;re told we need accountants, but the only real reason we need accountants is because the tax system is overly complicated. In the grand scheme of humanity its just wasted effort. Imagine if you took all these intelligent accountants, lawyers, marketeers, and set them to doing something useful. Imagine if we as a country really set our minds on an energy revolution. Imagine if scientists worked on bettering humanity rather than boosting pharmaceutical sales.</p>

<p>&quot;[...]&#39;The one who is unwilling to work shall not eat.&#39;&quot; (2.Thes. 3:10)  </p>

<p>How would lazy and unproductive people deserve the fruits of others&#39; labors? You not working forces us to do work <em>for you</em>!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have good points, work does give you something to do.  But i agree with OP as well, something isn&#39;t right with the way we live our lives.  For me i agree that we need to work at least to physically survive, food etc.  But working like we do, having something contstantly to do, and by extension phones to constantly look at with headphones to further occupy our lives, and movies tv everything to not ever have nothing to do- this makes it so we wouldn&#39;t know what to do if those didn&#39;t exist.  People can&#39;t sit still anymore, can&#39;t enjoy just silence and being alone.. They get bored.  I&#39;m very curious what would happen after the whole world suddenly didn&#39;t have all of these ways to disconnect and were forced to reconnect again, I really think it would do more good than harm.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yes, I totally agree.<br/>
Work is important and we should all be working (if physically able). On the other hand the kind of slavery of today, whether it be physical or mental slavery is getting out of hand. So yes, while work nowadays is going too far, abolishing work altogether (what I understand from OP&#39;s post) is horrible.  </p>

<p>Also, funny I&#39;m getting downvoted. Is it because I advocate for basic work to be important, or is it purely because I included a Bible verse? Let&#39;s remember that Downvoting should be reserved for comments which don&#39;t further discussion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah it&#39;s just the exact definition of work we differ on.&quot;Work&quot; to me implies that its something you don&#39;t want to be doing, but yeah definitely positive work if that&#39;s what you want to call it is good. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t agree that we &quot;should all be working&quot; if physically able. Maybe this is why your getting downvotes as you are being very dogmatic about it, stating this as though its a moral truth, which is exactly what I was calling into question. </p>

<p>If humans formed a society which enabled them to live whilst spending the absolute minimum time working possible, and this meant that most of their time was leisure time, I wouldn&#39;t impose this dogma upon them that everyone &quot;should work&quot;. If they could get away without working, I would say let them. Of course if people had a huge amount of leisure time I don&#39;t think they would spend it simply doing nothing. I think they would pursue their own goals and projects.. or maybe meditate until they achieved inner peace. If people had the right to dictate their own time and energy I think most people would spend it being creative. You could still call it work, but it would be good work. Imagine a highly automated and efficient society that has no need for huge amounts of work to be done. Would you consider the people of that society to be immoral if instead of working, they took some time to enjoy their short lives?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, I just have to butt in - </p>

<p>Humans have lived for <em>hundreds of thousands of years</em> without feeling like they have to &#39;work&#39;. &#39;Work&#39; being working for someone elses wealth and accomplishment.</p>

<p>We lived longer, more fulfilled lives with more leisure time.</p>

<p>We are more productive than ever, but work far more and there are more of us than ever in various forms of slavery - from human trafficking to the for-profit prisons. </p>

<p>And the lynchpin is that we are destroying the planet. Apple is destroying people and the planet. So is GE. So is Monsanto.</p>

<p>Change your mind, free it from the Protestant work ethic, and realize that - as OP said - intention is what makes real work meaningful.</p>

<p>This economy is so goddamn broken, it&#39;s hopeless. From the very core - elections - this country is rotten.</p>

<p>Work for yourselves first. No one in DC or at corporate HQ is looking out for you, and the outsourcing of jobs, student debt, economic crashes, and gradual tightening of longstanding freedoms our country was founded on have made it apparent to all but the most clueless.</p>
