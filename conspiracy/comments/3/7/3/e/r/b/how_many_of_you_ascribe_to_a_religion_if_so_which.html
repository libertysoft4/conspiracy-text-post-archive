<p>No, because the prophecies that happened so far are true and reasonable and have been mentioned in the previous scriptures. Here is a list for the curious: <a href="http://www.islaam.org/Al_Mahdi/all-one-page.htm#minor">http://www.islaam.org/Al_Mahdi/all-one-page.htm#minor</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>I think its reasonable because when there are no consequences its human nature to do what ever we feel like. Believing in an ultimate justice prevents many from doing crimes that they could get away with.</p>

<p>We believe the same , as Muslims its our belief that no one but God can decide who goes to heaven and who does not regardless of his or her religion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The bottom of the conspiracy rabbit hole is the spiritual nature of reality. Even though religions are a part of the control system, God is not only real but the very basis of reality from which all else manifests. All we experience has a deep spiritual purpose, and our consciousness is immensely powerful in creating our reality. The hiding of this knowledge is the number one priority of the elite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tend to look at religions as valid psychological operating systems and vehicles for culture.  I don&#39;t &#39;believe&#39; in religions, but I acknowledge their validity on some level, even if they are not factually precise in all of their claims.  I respect some people who are religious. I don&#39;t like to be anti- religious as that would limit my potential for friendships.  </p>

<p>Here is an example.  One of my friends from HS is a fireman. I can understand that he &quot;knows Jesus&quot; every day, because he might die in the line of duty on any given day.  I respect and understand that operating psychology, but it&#39;s not my own. </p>

<p>The Way, as taught by Jesus to His disciples, was at some point, perhaps early on, taken to be the facade of something more sinister and less moral, upright and Holy?</p>

<p>And by your verbiage you don&#39;t seem to be implying that Jesus was just the name given to the eternal Word, literally part of (what makes up) God, leaving Heaven bound for Mary&#39;s womb.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, the mansion in Heaven, right. </p>

<p>Third Woe. Now I&#39;m not sure with tribulation sequence this follows - or if it follows one at all - but are you referring to the second coming of a fiery-eyed Jesus with a sword in hand after the 7 years where the whole host of Heaven joins Him for a smackdown of the demons and/or the unfaithful idolators?</p>

<p>Where, may I ask, are you getting your information? If it&#39;s not from the Bible, which I assume you believe was pieced together by those trying to manipulate the Way, then what are your sources?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Allow me to speculate as to your position...</p>

<p>The Way, as taught by Jesus to His disciples, was at some point, perhaps early on, taken to be the facade of something more sinister and less moral, upright and Holy?</p>

<p>If this is near-accurate, do you believe Jesus was the visible image of God, actually God in the flesh?</p>
