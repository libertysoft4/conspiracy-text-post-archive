<p>Monsanto has proven 1000&#39;s of times over that they only care about profit not about human health whatsoever.  So what would be the point of trusting them that GMO&#39;s are safe when there is no reason for them to be honest?  What is the point of having patented seeds that you have to re-purchase every year or get sued?  Have you really never researched into GMO&#39;s?  because it seems that you are pretty biased toward them. </p>

<p>Much like pharmaceutical companies for profit, if you trust them take all of their vaccines and shots.   Same with Monsanto, if that is a company that you trust and think cares about our health then I&#39;d eat all the GMO&#39;s that you want.  If you don&#39;t have any reason to trust them and or just want to be on the safe side eat organic/non-gmo and grow as much food yourself as you can.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not necessarily the Genetically Modifying of the Organisms that is the health concern. Selective breeding is something that humans have been doing for years. Now we are using a bit more science. Still, nothing horrible.</p>

<p>The issue is that these organisms are being modified to survive extreme drenching of pesticides and herbicides. So, in theory, it&#39;s great. We build corn that can survive after killing all of the weeds and pests. Makes farming easier, more crops, win win right? Well, if the herbicides and pesticides weren&#39;t so harmful it would be. These chemicals are <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/28/business/energy-environment/decades-after-monsantos-roundup-gets-an-all-clear-a-cancer-agency-raises-concerns.html?_r=0">known carcinogens</a> and <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2014/2/21/silencing_the_scientist_tyrone_hayes_on">have even been proven to cause reproductive issues and change the sexual organs on amphibians</a>. </p>

<p>You certainly can easily debate that GMO crops might not cause issues. They have been studied for years and do not seem to cause conclusive correlations with disease. But, it isn&#39;t the GMO. It&#39;s the herbicides and pesticides that these GMO crops get sprayed with that is causing health problems from cancer to autism. Now, they have sprayed so much that they have created super weeds that can no longer be killed with herbicides. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a good documentary on the subject on HULU called <a href="http://www.hulu.com/watch/709025">Our Daily Poison</a>. </p>

<p>Stick with organic produce. If for any other reason that simply &quot;Why not&quot;. There aren&#39;t issues revolving around organic produce. There are issues surrounding GMO crops. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From that link. </p>

<p>&quot;What makes organic farming different, then? It&#39;s not the use of pesticides, it&#39;s the origin of the pesticides used. Organic pesticides are those that are derived from natural sources and processed lightly if at all before use. This is different than the current pesticides used by conventional agriculture, which are generally synthetic.&quot;</p>

<p>But if you know of some organic pesticides that are worse, your first sentence in this quote doesn&#39;t make sense. You state that you have a preference, but we don&#39;t know why.</p>

<p>You state later on that you prefer certain brands, so that means you agree some organic foods are no better than non-organic foods because you don&#39;t like the pesticides they use.</p>

<p>How come are we not arguing for the proper labeling of every pesticide used in organic foods? I just went through some of the packages of organic foods in my fridge I and saw no mention of the specific pesticides they&#39;re using. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m eating food with Rotetone or Pyrethrum, or both.</p>

<p>link of herbicides insecticides to cancer,</p>

<p>they modify nature to give the plant more immunities with DNA from other plants, animal, fish, lizard, virus, etc without really knowing what it does to humans, because the longest term study on GMO is 6 months, but they say its safe to human, yet they only did study GMO on humans for 6 months, ohhh sorry, i mean we are the test subjects.</p>

<p>look at graph of cancer rates per year, you can clearly see rate going up, yet we have best &quot;science&quot; compare to decades before, isnt it strange? it also coincide with the rate we adopted using GMO from monsantos.</p>

<p>Also before you die at 67 year sold they will sell your anti cancer drugs and chemotherapy to slow down the cancer and make more money from you.</p>

<p>Its a great plan overall, I just dont feel its a good idea to trigger that trap.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How is the retracted Seralini study not credible, you ask?  I&#39;ll ignore that Seralini was already the founder and president of an anti GMO organization long before he conducted this study, because if the science is good then his personal bias shouldn&#39;t matter.  I&#39;ll ignore that Seralini already had a history of poorly conducted GMO studies, because if the science on THIS study is good then that shouldn&#39;t matter.  I&#39;ll ignore that Seralini didn&#39;t release any photos of his control group, because if the data and methodology is good, then alright then.  But the science isn&#39;t good, the data is spotty, and the methodology is questionable.  Seralini used Sprague-Dawley rats, which typically have a life span of 2 years and are bread to have a whopping 70-80% chance of developing cancer before end of life.  Because of their high chances of dying within two years, the recommended sample size is 65 per group.  Séralini only used ten per group.  The only useful thing to be gained from the Seralini study is how NOT to conduct a study.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s Seralini&#39;s study. There are PLENTY of reasons that it&#39;s not credible, ranging from piss-poor methodologies to not including data that contradicted his conclusion to not disclosing conflicts of interest in his funding. (That study has been retracted, by the way...)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t gone deep, but here&#39;s what I can offer.</p>

<p>Some strains of fruits/veggies are genetically modified to be &quot;Roundup-ready&quot;, meaning they are resistant to Monsanto&#39;s herbicide Roundup. Very convenient for farmers who can spray a metric fuckton of herbicide on their crops and kill the weeds, keep the crops.</p>

<p>But Roundup does nasty things to humans who ingest it. Among other things, it kills your gut flora. Basically it can shut down your digestive system. You&#39;ll get the shits and your body will be unable to process nutrients. </p>

<p>And it&#39;s carcinogenic, so welcome to Tumor Town.</p>

<p>So if you&#39;re eating genetically modified food, there&#39;s a good chance you&#39;re eating Roundup too.</p>

<p>I have no idea what splicing a carrot with a toad will do to you,</p>

<p>There&#39;s my little contribution. Also, fuck you Monsanto PR shills in advance. I hope you spend many years in prison.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, let&#39;s start:</p>

<p>I claim that it&#39;s safe to ingest one molecule. Is this incorrect? What quantities do you suggest are unsafe, and where is your evidence for these claims?</p>

<p>Here is my evidence, which covers much more than one molecule:</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyphosate#Human_toxicity">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyphosate#Human_toxicity</a></p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Human acute toxicity is dose-related. Acute fatal toxicity has been reported in deliberate overdose.[54][55] Early epidemiological studies did not find associations between long-term low-level exposure to glyphosate and any disease.[56][57][58] In 2013 the European commission reviewed a 2002 finding that had concluded equivocal evidence existed of a relationship between glyphosate exposure during pregnancy and cardiovascular malformations and <strong>found the evidence &quot;fails to support a potential risk for increased cardiovascular defects as a result of glyphosate exposure during pregnancy.&quot;[59] A 2013 review found that neither glyphosate nor typical glyphosate-based formulations (GBFs) pose a genotoxicity risk in humans under normal conditions of human or environmental exposures.</strong>[60]</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>No?</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The EPA, which last reviewed glyphosate in 1993, considers glyphosate to be noncarcinogenic and relatively low in dermal and oral acute toxicity.[31] <strong>The EPA considered a &quot;worst case&quot; dietary risk model of an individual eating a lifetime of food derived entirely from glyphosate-sprayed fields with residues at their maximum levels. This model indicated that no adverse health effects would be expected under such conditions.</strong>[31] As of March 2015, the EPA was in the midst of reviewing glyphosate&#39;s toxicity.[5]</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Is that not enough?</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A 2013 systematic review by the German Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR), conducted as part of the EFSA&#39;s review process, examined epidemiological studies, animal studies, and in vitro studies that it found valid, and found that <strong>&quot;no classification and labelling for carcinogenicity is warranted&quot;</strong> and <strong>did not recommend a carcinogen classification</strong> of either 1A or 1B.[9]:Volume 1, p139, see also 34–37 It was provided to the EFSA in January 2014 and published by the EFSA in December 2014[9][61][62]</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>I assume that that&#39;s not enough either, right? I mean, clearly the European commision, the EPA, and the EFSA are all on Mon$atan&#39;s payroll. They can afford to do this while making literally orders of magnitude less money than oil companies, which have 100% bought out all climate scientists, which is why you see all of them agreeing that anthropogenic climate change isn&#39;t real. Right?</p>

<p>But I mean, hey, if toxicity and carcinogenicity aren&#39;t enough, let&#39;s just talk straight oral LD-50s in mg/kg (for rats):</p>

<p>Glyphosate: 5,108</p>

<p>Vinegar: 3,350</p>

<p>Salt: 3,000</p>

<p>Can you tell me more about how dangerous glyphosate is? </p>

<p>By the way, where&#39;s the video of you eating the kg of salt, you Big Sodium puppet? That&#39;s all I wanted, but you evidently are too much of a coward and enjoy your paycheck too much. Why haven&#39;t <em>you</em> made a positive statement?</p>

Scientists who know more about this than I do (and <em>much</em> more about it than you do) have come to the conclusion that it&#39;s noncarcinogenic. It isn&#39;t something that I believe, it&#39;s something that&#39;s true to the best of anybody on the planet&#39;s knowledge.</p>

<p>Further, I&#39;m a grad student. Please present some evidence that I&#39;m secretly a PR firm employee; certainly everybody who disagrees with you is paid to do so, because nobody could do that of their own free will.</p>
