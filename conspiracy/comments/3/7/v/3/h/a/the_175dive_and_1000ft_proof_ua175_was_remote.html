I recently discovered the &#39;1000ft Proof&quot; which proves that UA175 must have been remote controlled. An important part of this is getting thru some of the deliberate disinfo about UA175. for example some faithers say it levelled off when it actually maintained its dive all thru its approach to the south Tower.</p>

see page 2 <a href="http://imgur.com/Q4NLCMG">for this diagram</a> showing the constant dive, ua175s remote controller slowed its dive to &#39;take aim&#39; -necesary when he was not on board ;)  - then continued its dive to accelerate to its max speed again) </p>

<p>Knowing this allows us to focus on the approppriate performance ability (dive speed aka &#39;Vd&#39;) and the results are irrefutible. See below.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>1000ft Proof</strong> I recently completed, which proves that the UA175 767 could not possibly have been flown by an amateur untrained pilot.
It is irrefutable.
Here is the main points:  </p>

<p>The 767 was built in about 1984 and was tested to meet the <a href="http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgFAR.nsf/0/1AF764F921FAD01C862568E900643105?OpenDocument">FAA/FAR regulations at the time</a>.<br/>
These require the plane to prove it can fly stable at Vd +20%.  This means at dive speed + 20%.    (see FAR 23.629)
This is the maximum the plane can go without risk of crashing due to problems like flutter.  </p>

<p>The <a href="http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgMakeModel.nsf/0/a8694be7b7ac6c178625731e006944bc/$FILE/A1NM%20Rev%2026.pdf">Vd of this 767 (being a 767-200) was  420KCAS</a> at 1000ft.  which is easily converted to 420kEAS (at 1000ft it makes no difference).  </p>

<p>420 x 1.2 = 504 KEAS.  <em>(so this is what the plane was capable of with zero crash risk, provided it was diving)</em></p>

<p>UA175 was in a complex diving maneover right up to hitting the south tower(see my &#39;175Dive&#39; proof above), and was recorded doing 510knots ground speed, which after accounting for various factors/altitude wind etc is exactly...<br/>
...<a href="http://imgur.com/garukrH">504KEAS</a>    </p>

<p>So on approach to the tower the plane was constantly doing 504KEAS, the maximum proven stable speed it can sustain without crashing.<br/>
Coincidence?  of course not.  An amateur pilot could not have sustained performance exactly on the knife edge like that.  </p>

<p><strong>This proves the plane was (at the very least) remotely controlled. They designed it to fly as fast as possible, with zero risk of any embarrassing crash that might expose the plot. (there are not convenient old underground mines everywhere you know ;)</strong></p>

<p><strong>the 175Dive and the 1000ft Proof. Critical to 9/11Truth.</strong>  </p>

<p><em>Other points worth remembering</em>:<br/>
<em>- VMO is irrelevant, Vd is higher than Vmo so once its clear that the 767 reach vd+20%, wheather or not it exceeded vmo is obvious</em><br/>
<em>- 1000ft is the only correct altitude to analyse its performance. 30,000ft or any other are also irrelevant: ua175 was not at those altitudes. (beware any analyses which disregard ua175s actual height and mess around with overcomplex calcs for other altitudes)</em></p>

<p>Now you&#39;re saying they were flying at a perfectly legit speed?  How does that prove they were &quot;remote controlled?&quot;</p>

<p>I would imagine that the cockpit has all kinds of speed indicators and it shouldn&#39;t be that hard for the terrorists to stick to a safe but maximal speed, even if they aren&#39;t expert pilots.  I would bet there are overspeed alarms of various kinds, too.</p>

<p>Nothing about it is consistent with remote control. There is <em>nothing</em> that suggests remote control. There&#39;s no way to glean from any of this there was some sort of remote control involved. </p>

<p>You can go ahead and say &quot;well that was strange&quot;. Sure, yeah. Remarkable. But the leap from &quot;that happened in a manner contrary to what is expected&quot; to &quot;remote control&quot; is immense. </p>

<p>There&#39;s no auto pilot for that and it&#39;s not as simple as lining up a pistol shot. Both planes hit within ten floors of each other. How did they practice the impacting of the towers? That&#39;s not something you just sit down behind a plane and do. </p>

<p>You seem to be confused. Nothing you posted suggests, even in the slightest that the plane was remote controlled. You&#39;re making that inference on your own with nothing to support it.</p>

<p>This is a non-sequitur.</p>

<p>Other possible explanations might be:</p>

<ul>
<li>the amateurs were &#39;lucky&#39;</li>
<li>the pilots weren&#39;t amateurs</li>
<li>the pilots might have been another member of the crew or passengers (or unknown party) who <em>did</em> have experience</li>
<li>autopilot or other on-board automated controller performed the maneuver</li>
<li>the plane wasn&#39;t a normal plane</li>
<li>the footage is fake</li>
<li>aliens</li>
</ul>

<p>All you have shown is that it&#39;s unlikely that amateurs performed the maneuvers. You haven&#39;t disproved it. And you certainly haven&#39;t provided any evidence of remote control. Any of the above could be equally valid alternative hypotheses.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying I believe you or any of the other possible explanations, just that your argument (which is otherwise good) falls down at this final leap to &#39;remote control&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>Why</em> is it the only explanation? You haven&#39;t said.</p>

<p>I read it perfectly well. There is, unfortunately, a hole in your logic, which I will attempt to explain:</p>

<p>You present a good case for why this couldn&#39;t be done by an amateur untrained pilot. Fine, no problem there. I think a lot of people, including pilots, will agree with you.</p>

<p>OK. So if it wasn&#39;t an amateur untrained pilot, we must look for another explanation. OK, let&#39;s do that.</p>

<p>There could be all manner of possible explanations from the simple to the outlandish. Probably some of the silly ones we can dismiss out-of-hand, e.g. it was aliens, the devil, etc. OK. Fair enough.</p>

<p>So let&#39;s pick a reasonable one. Let&#39;s say our hypothesis is that it&#39;s a skilled pilot operating by remote control.</p>

<p>How can we show that this is the <em>only</em> explanation? Well, technically, we can&#39;t, but maybe we can probably do so to a level of beyond reasonable doubt. Let&#39;s compare it to some other reasonable possibilities.</p>

<p>There are a number of alternative theories that are indistinguishable from this hypothesis (given the argument so far)....</p>

<p>Remember: our working hypothesis is that it is a pilot working by remote control (and your argument is that it MUST be remote control of some kind), so for each one of the following we must be able to provide some evidence or argument that remote control is the better hypothesis... if we can&#39;t tell the difference based on our argument and evidence so far, then our hypothesis can&#39;t be the ONLY possibility.</p>

<p>So here are some reasonable alternatives.. does the argument you&#39;ve presented so far actually discount them?...</p>

<ol>
<li>It could be a skilled pilot on the plane... The US gov lied about the pilots. Maybe they did receive proper training, and the US gov doesn&#39;t want to admit this. How can you tell the difference between a skilled pilot on the plane itself, or a skilled pilot operating by remote control? What is in your argument that shows that? e.g. is there some evidence that remote control was used specifically, and it couldn&#39;t be a pilot on board? You don&#39;t seem to provide that in your argument, so there is no way to distinguish this hypothesis from our hypothesis of &#39;pilot by remote control&#39;. So both must be equally valid, without further evidence or argument.</li>
<li>An advanced automatic pilot / guidance system on board the plane. This is arguably even better than a skilled pilot. An advance cruise missile-type guidance system could out-perform skilled pilots to perfectly replicate such maneuvers at speeds a pilot may be unused to, and keep the plane stable in unusual conditions with reactions faster than any human. What evidence or argument have you presented that means that remote control is more likely? None. So how can you disprove the hypothesis of an on-board guidance system vs &#39;pilot by remote control&#39;? You haven&#39;t presented any, so both must be considered equally valid at this point.</li>
<li>Advanced guidance system operating by remote control. Similar to hypothesis 2. Now, you might say, well yes, it could be that (after all, you just argued for &#39;remote control&#39;, not necessarily by a pilot). But consider Occam&#39;s Razor: If an advanced guidance system over remote control is one hypothesis, and we can&#39;t tell the difference between an advanced on-board guidance system and an advanced remote-control guidance system (as shown above), then why pick the remote-control one, which is the more complex hypothesis? Occam&#39;s Razor would guide us away from remote control when deciding between the two in the absence of any other evidence or argument. There must be some piece of evidence or explanation as to why you prefer remote control, rather than on-board in this scenario. But you never provided it.</li>
</ol>

<p>You see what I&#39;m getting at? You just go straight to your preferred hypothesis, and state without any evidence or argument that it is the ONLY possibility. It&#39;s certainly a reasonable solution, but you say it&#39;s the ONLY one, which is a very strong statement, but don&#39;t provide any strong argument for it. You simply don&#39;t say why it could <em>only</em> be remote control.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t explore other options. You say:</p>

<p>It can&#39;t be X, therefore it must be Y.</p>

<p>That is a logical fallacy. &quot;It can only be Y&quot; (remote control) does NOT follow logically from &quot;Not X&quot; (unskilled amateur pilot). This is basic propositional logic.</p>

<p>What about Z, P, Q, R, A, B, C, ... ? Which you haven&#39;t considered in your argument. Why Y and not Q? (It doesn&#39;t even matter what Y and Q are -- the fallacy is apparent symbolically.)</p>

<p>Just because you can&#39;t think of an alternative (fallacy of &#39;lack of imagination&#39; -- no offence intended, that&#39;s just what this logical fallacy is called) or you just can&#39;t see how the other explanations could have possibly happened (fallacy of &#39;personal incredulity&#39;), doesn&#39;t mean that your hypothesis is correct.</p>
