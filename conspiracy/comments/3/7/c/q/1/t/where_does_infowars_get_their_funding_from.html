        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi!  New here to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.  I&#39;m not a believer in any particular conspiracy theory, but I do like to keep track of what conspiracy theorists are discussing.</p>

<p>As part of that &quot;keeping track&quot; I do check in on the Infowars site every so often.  Over time I have noticed that they link to &quot;RT&quot; (Russian Times, a known Russian propaganda outfit) an awful lot, and that their international news has a markedly pro-Russian slant.  This was painfully obvious during the Ukrainian crisis a while back.</p>

<p>Is Infowars part of a Russian propaganda machine?  Do they get funding from Russia?  I don&#39;t understand why they would have so much pro-Russia material otherwise.</p>

<p>It alarms me because so much of the material on Infowars gradually makes it&#39;s way out into other right wing news sources.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>EDIT:  Did a quick Google search.  His radio show is syndicated by Genesis Communication, which was founded in 1998 by Midas Resources - &quot;a vendor of gold and silver coins&quot;.  I&#39;m going to look deep into that particular angle.  </p>

<p>Estimates of Alex Jones&#39; net worth and income seem to vary wildly.  I&#39;m seeing $1.5 million/year from FORBES, to $2.7 to &quot;potentially $10 million&quot; a year from SALON.  </p>

<p>yeepers.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t pay much attention to AJ. It could be that he is pro-Russian out of a reactionary contrarianism (like a lot of Putin fans around here) or as a kind of &quot;counterbalance&quot; to the very anti-Russia propaganda which is common in the MSM. Maybe as he&#39;s become more popular over the years he&#39;s started to get &quot;reimbursed&quot; for it. Who knows?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would say it s a floating source. Back in the 90s, they were vary much a right wing job because of anti Clinton sentiments but they we also very civil liberties which gave them a lefty at times feel at times. Then when W was in office, well just about anything Bush said was fair game so it seemed a little left of center at times  while still being very much to the right or was anti bush without coming off as &#39;kill the Christians&#39; and still having a government is bad message.  Now with Obama, it seemed to have moved into the idea that a ruling elite has finally embraced main stream rap music, so government is still pretty bad and whatever they embrace is probably the opposite of what we want as a nation. So if the US and the EU says we are worried about the Ukraine, Alex Jones will instantly assume the opposite. Any funding they might get would most likely be after the fact. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If infowars is part of some propaganda machine, it is more likely controlled dissent rather than Russian affiliated. The only reason Russian news makes it to r/conspiracy so often is because many of the conspiracies circulated here are perpetrated by the US government or those in control of it, so the Russian media would naturally try and expose that - or stir the anti-US sentiment. Russian sources are likely plenty of both, exposing US corruption and/or adding fuel to false conspiracies. Both could be viewed as propaganda, as their intent either way is anti-US.</p>

<p>Edit: infowars is viewed by some as controlled dissent because of their exclusion of Israel relating to popular conspiracies. That and having a spokesman who seems incapable of speech without an artery popping tirade, that many view as a means to discredit and misdirect.</p>

<p>They link to a wide variety of sites, which include RT.   Just because RT is based in Russia, doesn&#39;t mean that they don&#39;t occasionally have some decent news stories there.</p>
