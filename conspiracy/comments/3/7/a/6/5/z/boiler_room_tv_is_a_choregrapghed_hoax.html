With depressed look on her face....the guy with blue shirt a bow tie and the Asian check...the looking at each other serial tension is all an act...the tall guy with Zedd tshirt who slowly works his way to the front throughout who is fucked up on drugs it&#39;s all in the script..the girl with shoulder length black hair...

Straight away at the start of that boiler room the girl on the left of the dj with the leopoard print cross on her top. She makes sure all the &quot;characters&quot; and little side shows occur... I havent watched that on through but guaranteed its all loosely choregrapghed (even what they wear) That was feb 2013 the clip you posted This one is October 2014 <a href="https://youtu.be/5vHRUsP20dQ">https://youtu.be/5vHRUsP20dQ</a> go to 26 minutes - but she is throughout - but 26min she is on the right of the DJ the same girl You can see her stressed throughout when the &quot;characters&quot; whisper in her ear....and she reminds them its filming your in character....and they continually brush it oiff as though yeah im in character just laugh and dont worry gesture with the hand....the next girl to the right is playing the straight face depressed girl... the guy with the head band --- you can see he tries to help certain people get into position at times.... In Tullum - same thing is with the back curly haired girl..... The magdalena one in Tullum - daytime with no one around. There most of main characters (out of character or different character) that play parts in the Acid Pauli and Salomon shows are the &quot;extras&quot;. The guy who apppers suprised at the start who starts talking to the DJ, and then its like cut away makes you think he is some random dude just walked up to her cause she started playing and was wondering what was going on - then stage fright feeling like when he realises... He is an organiser and plays the dodgy mexican character with the scarf eyeballing the blue dress girl at the end. And th drug dealer is in magdalenas with the sunnies on just random cuts to him leaning against a post etc. its all setup specific for Boiler Room TV-you hear press release certain DJ couldnt play his set cause it was too crowded, all part of the hype And though it looks packed - theres barely more than 20-30 people and the camera is always looking in. There is no crowd in front of the DJ always behind - just cameras , directors, extras rolling in and out.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not true at all. The first one that comes to mind is <a href="https://youtu.be/OraL6lKoyXE?t=1h3m">DJ EZ</a>. Plenty of people in front of him.</p>

<p>Like I said earlier in the thread, I&#39;ve been to a Boiler Room set, and I know someone who&#39;s played for them. You&#39;re completely off base.</p>

<p>The audience at Boiler Room tends to be people involved in the music scene somehow, so if the same person shows up to two different Boiler Room sets <em>in the same city</em> that should hardly be surprising. Not to mention the sound/video/lights guys have to travel to get shit set up and when things are running smoothly they will undoubtedly be partying with everyone else, so yeah, watch enough and you&#39;ll probably see the same faces sometimes.</p>

<p>But dude.... lay off the dope. If you think that the Boiler Room audience is choreographed, I&#39;d hate to hear what you think about the relationships with people you know. These are paranoid delusions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>how many people can you count in the maceo plex video?
struggle to find 20 - this is Berlin? so i am suprised the same people are in everyone. Theres only one explanation for that. Its BS. what about when the same people turn up 4 or 5 times and in another country. Orchestrated BS. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I admire your determination in maintaining the illusion. The no crowd in front of the DJ is generally the case not always, Surgeon is an example of the choregrapghed dumb audience on one side being filmed an the real audience out in front. I havent seen them all so i cant saying there all fake - but they probably are. The ones ive seen are.When the same people show up twice in the same city i am a bit suprised - its meant to be Berlin not some small town (theres barely 20 people in these videos)...Obviously well orchestrated..When you see the same person 3 or 4 times you started thinking whats going on here, then 5 times over 2 years and in another country? Whats that about? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s cause I&#39;ve watched it over and over.. The Boiler Room in Tullum of Acid Paul.. the comments are controlled on youtube.. .You see the comments about a drug deal about around 6mins40seconds or ssomething...its got 180 thumbs up...If you watch the whole video. .he is dealing throughout....but you can see that they point out the camera...like oh know it&#39;s on camera im busted....it&#39;s all part of the staged audience act. The same guy is in the magdalena video just cruising. The girl with the black curly hair makes sure it&#39;s all as scripted..shes in the solomun and magadalena videos. Towards the of the acid pauli video the chick with blue dress white top glitter on her face and mouse ears....1hour 55minutes on th left..short guy arrive soon on the dance floor with tall long black haired girl...Who is also in the salomon youtube boiler room.. they arrive like a couple...the guy has this silk scarf around his neck..but the blue dress girl dances right in his face...and he has the look like all his xmasses have come at once...and  your led to believe he his thinking of dumping his tall black hair check for the blue dress chick...and the look of concern is evident on the tall black hair girls face...the short guy goes and comes back with a split...gives it to his black haired girlfriend....and the senses of relief on her face that she still has his man and shes still is girl is evident....not long after he fires up another and passes it to the blue dress chick.....Then you get the sense he realises he is in the shit..its all an act..that guy is the same guy who talks to magdalena in that video at the start.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When they shoot these, they probably use the same people with some acting in order to produce an aesthetically pleasing video.</p>

<p>But where&#39;s the conspiracy? This has been happening forever. They just don&#39;t want a bunch of real druggies up front, or at least real druggies they don&#39;t know, because they might do something out of touch, which might fuck up their revenue stream, viewers, etc.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a sound business decision and not at all a conspiracy. Use the meth focus somewhere else. You discovered something that is basically common business sense and that nobody gives a fuck about anyways, and for good reason. That&#39;s the worst part about this :(</p>

<p>These higher-profile DJs will probably not even accept a &quot;real&quot; audience 2 feet from them like that. It&#39;s common sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you admit they do - so why arent you allowed to comment as such on their youtube videos - Why are all the comments specifically set up. The viewer is deceived by the actions of the audience and comments on the nature of their behaviour which is fake.
They&#39;re lying to their audience and it thats not cool.
The make out its some cool party when its infact all contrived.
Its cool to watch - but why not admit it for what it is.
A studio audience.</p>

<p>If its been happening forever - give me another example. Bolier Room is not honest about what they produce - everyone thinks wow - but in fact its fake</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, I kind of see what you&#39;re saying here. It is kinda seedy, and not in the way that they are trying to make it seem.</p>

<p>I guess I&#39;m not bothered by it because this kind of thing is commonplace whenever &quot;real&quot; videos of sketchy stuff are sold/shown with monetary motivations.</p>

<p>A good example is themed porn, especially in Europe (just because more volume of this stuff comes out of Europe). All the &quot;public pick-ups&quot; or whatnot are all choreographed videos with actresses and at least loose scripts, and that&#39;s definitely not what they&#39;re trying to present to the viewer.</p>

<p>I get that it&#39;s not an identical situation, but I think they do it for the same reasons. They want something that&#39;s not actually illegal/super sketchy, because the people in it/behind it could get in trouble, but that looks like it, because that&#39;s &quot;raw&quot; and that&#39;s what people want to see.</p>

<p>The porn comparison is immediately what I thought of when you asked for one, because I&#39;ve seen a lot of the same stuff happen in European porn especially, but reality TV in general is another example, all over the world. Very few if any &quot;reality&quot; TV shows are real at all, as we all know, and this kind of falls into that category to me (&quot;real underground rave, everyone&#39;s on drugs, watch them be all fucked up and do party shit!&quot;).</p>

<p>All in all, I can see how it would bother some people, and I shouldn&#39;t have been quite so myopic in my response, but it honestly seems sort of obvious to me, so I was a bit surprised anyone would be so upset about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That response will do me. I will walk away now. I have wasted too much thought and time on it. Your initial response is the closest i got to someone thinking about what i was saying was happening. The across the board rejection of my claim is what i couldnt believe. Most just straight out went about cutting me down rather than tried to understand what i was on about.
The same thing occurs in the MMA - its gone down the WWE/wwf route,though its made to look more realistic/brutal than wwf became.
What i wanted to know, do most know this fact, specifically about boiler room tv, or if they do discover this fact do the prefer to just brush it aside...because i had thought it was real. When i found out otherwise i guess i shouldnt have been suprised - but most viewers out there are suprised and prefer to believe it is real. 
Then i think really should i even care....as i dont really.........and is it right or wrong to open a thread about it...based on what i definitely uncovered...?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s all about what sells. Scripted reality sells because it&#39;s much easier to produce on a consistent basis than real, interesting reality. People might say they&#39;re interested in watching real things, but the vast majority of the time they can&#39;t tell the difference. Frankly, a lot of stuff that starts out as real is turned scripted because people can&#39;t help but see things they could improve on by scripting, and think they&#39;re doing everyone a favor by switching.</p>

<p>People often don&#39;t acknowledge things like this because they don&#39;t care (they enjoy it anyways), or there&#39;s enough ambiguity for them to brush it off because they don&#39;t want to believe it. I don&#39;t actually listen to this type of music or regularly watch these videos, so it&#39;s hard for me to say, but I think it&#39;s a combination of those things in this case.</p>

<p>Caring about it is probably a waste of time, though. What&#39;s it going to accomplish?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like what you say and agree totally. I enjoy these Boiler Room videos and what im saying doesnt change that. To be honest there my favorite videos the Acid Pauli BR and Maceo Plex BR.
I guess im on the line of not caring but now i cant stop. I would say 6months agoo when the MAceo Plex video came out i had a feeling and probably i was in this category were you said....&quot;People often don&#39;t acknowledge things like this because they don&#39;t care (they enjoy it anyways), or there&#39;s enough ambiguity for them to brush it off because they don&#39;t want to believe it.&quot; 
Then with the these Tullum BR ones, i sat through the whole lot maybe 3 of them last Friday or Saturday night - drop 2 acid tabs and loved it......but it became obvious that the little bits i laughed at or thought i picked up in the audience were orchestrated for reasons that are valid enough which you have pointed out in a rational way. I became fixated on proving it wasnt real and forgot to brush it off. I had noone to bounce it off (married 4 kids oldest 7 - true storey believe it or not) and it was killing me in a way that i didnt know if everyone knew this already and i am the last to know this or that no one knew this and therefore i had to tell them or if really anyway gave a fuck///........the last bit....&quot;did anyone really give a fuck&quot;-was my feeling, but i had spent a lot of time on this.
So maybe the next night i tried to get my wife interested enough to get her to understand what i was on about....(she really didnt give a fuck and though she kind of appeared to understand she didnt want to know anymore about it after probably less than 5minutes)I was dissappointed how quickly and easily she brushed it off. Actually the day after that we had an argument, she doesnt do drugs, or really knows i do, but we argued about something and a point in her argument was how crazy i was becoming and highlighted my obsession spending allnight watching these videos and telling her about these stupid meaningless observations.
Unfortunately i wasnt convinced she understood the importance of my discovery, so it kept burning inside. Then i thought lets try reddit, i come to reddit only for drug talk really and STIMS was a place i thought i could get some worthwhile feedback from people...Yes people.
So i started the thread METH and the boiler room - with my ground breaking discovery. I got about 4 or 5 replies and mostly - nearly all thought i was onto something, really i wish others had told me the crazy shit they discovered and thought was important to only later realise wtf.. But i got encouragemment which gave me belief - i wish you had written your previous email there 3 or 4 days ago.. However,one of the suggestions was drop it into conspiracy which i did thinking this is big news. Unfortunately the reception wasnt so positive - i would say no one was positive at all. Droping my drug induced discovery onto the weird normal people in the conspiracy sub i was attacked for even thinking it. You kind of aknowledge it but also as something very minor and hardly worth caring about - which is where im trying to get to now and as far as i wish i went....
However most were attacking me for the thought - most people who replied - couldnt see any reason for it and made out i was fucked up and crazy on drugs to think anything like that could possibly happen.
So i though these people here in conspiracy dont know what im talking about se i searched for a sub to do with that kind of music. i never entered futurebeats before but dropped my bomb there which was getting points no but not much written support.. Then it seemed like i had really upset people who seemed to have close ties with the boiler room, they new names and of people i was talking about and tried to blow my &quot;theory&quot; away. There determination to not even slighhtly aknowledge what i was trying to say made me pissed off... I didnt understand there anger (still dont) in thinking like you or looking at what i was saying.. Could of discussed it in a nice way, rather than a verbal assault for even thinking. So thats where i am now. Fighting with people who either know what im saying is right and are determined for the sake of their credibility- lie, or that there too attached to it in away that the cant see as possible. Everytime the go on about it being impossible, you start thinking really what are they so afraid of.
ive definitely wasted too much time on it which is irritating me. 
So its 2am Saturday morning. Time for my last acid tab...none left after this one</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry to hear about your struggle with this. I&#39;ve totally been there with stims making nothing, or close to nothing, seem like the biggest deal in the world. They just have this way of getting you fixated, and if you get upset about something, you can get stuck there for way longer than you realize. I actually got to this post from <a href="/r/stims">/r/stims</a>. It&#39;s pretty much my only sub.</p>

<p>But yeah, I&#39;m really not sure why other people are getting so upset about it. They might look at you and be like &quot;OMG HE&#39;S SUCH A METH HEAD, LOOK AT THAT WALL OF TEXT!&quot; but as far as the facts go, I&#39;d bet plenty of money on you being right about it being choreographed.</p>

<p>I do wonder what they&#39;re so afraid of. Frankly, I don&#39;t see why fans would care all that much for the most part, although I can see why the Boiler Room people would want to keep it on the DL. I got over my Euro porn being fake/scripted pretty quickly, and I can&#39;t imagine why anyone would care nearly as much about what amounts to a background video for some music being scripted. Nobody is saying the DJs are fakes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That would be good, I dont really care or need that piece of mind, but if whoever you ask tells you the truth, than you will see what im talking about im sure. To me its really obvious (its not a big deal in my opinion) and initially when i decided to post about it i was thinking perhaps everyone knows this already and im bit slow to work it out.
But to get such heavy critiscm for even considering this could happen and attacking me for the thought of it...well cant help but wonder wtf....See its not blantantly obvious, though from the reaction ive got you can tell its meant to be a secret. Its not important if they admit it and to get it you do need to study it, but if you dont want to get it then you dont have to...Its easy to accept it as real, but im telling you it isnt and i dont need confirmation of that....YES it isnt worth worrying about but denying is hard to understand and thats were they should lose credibility... Really the answer should be and so what or derr obviously.......i think with that in mind, you allow say people like me to not question the reality,and i think it opens up more oppurtunity in the videos to really make them even weirder and crazier, like they do already. Having A basic understanding of the way the world operates today is enough to understand the reasons why they do. LITIGATION. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, I care. I care about integrity, especially in the music business, because I&#39;m a part of this and don&#39;t want to support something that&#39;s meant to fool the audience. It&#39;s lying.</p>

<p>But from personal and second-hand experience, what you&#39;re saying is not the case.</p>

<p>From a logical standpoint, I don&#39;t think Boiler Room could pull it off even if they wanted to. Imagine the costs of shipping the actors across the world all the time. It&#39;s hard enough for promoters to even afford a single headliner. I know this from experience.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Do you think everyone here is trying to keep that secret? What makes you think anyone posting here has a vested interest in Boiler Room? Check their posting histories. It&#39;s more likely they&#39;re skeptical because this scenario is highly unlikely, even given your evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>from the comments but i think i probably gotten more up votes than out and out critiscm. I take most of the upvotes as support. I except people are skeptical, i was too and i watched videos many times without noticing (youtube is different sometimes i listen without even watching a video - but with technology now you start to watch whole things through and on a larger screen such as your tv and probably not many would, but if you sit and watch like its movie then you get to see what i am on about). It took me a while to get to that point, i didnt setout looking for that.
When the maceo plex video first came out, I commented something like its almost too good to be true, how funny and how entertaining it was, i might of said its like bad actors from a b grade movie...just a nothing youtube comment really, it was just along the lines of how funny and how much i enjoyed it. For some reason the comment got deleted...naturally thats going to make you think why it was deleted. i wasnt upset or didnt recomment about it and i didnt care my comment was deleted and now your probably the first person i am telling..But naturally your start think why and all i could put it down to was they didnt want people comment about the reality of it being like a bad movie.....But i didnt have that thought my comments intention was trying to imply how funny...i thought ok fair enough stupid comment by me. My problem i become too big a fan of these videos. I was in defence of the characters to be honest, and never considered it was fake until about 2 weeks ago.
So then solomun video arrived an Acid Pauli, i was like great i get right into there sets the DJ the tracks and of course the crowd is great - get me there is how i feel. Ive probably listened to them way too many times....then i decide have a party in my head for old times sake, drop some acid watch it all the way through at home (i understand people thinks that blows my credibility, but i am fairly normal i have a job i am married have 4 kids and run a business - but i have issues i understand that). 
Generally, people wont pick up on what i am talking about without going through it more than once. So its hard to believe, i too would of told the OP (me) that he is a crazy dick as well. My favorite videos are BoilerRoom videos of Djs i like...i look forward to the next....
What happpened though is i ended up reaching the point of your first sentence in your last post....i dont doubt the people are on drugs or the crowd is having a good time, but from what i can tell most of the things people comment on in youtube are. Im not sure if scripted or choreograpghed are the right words - but the plots and little incidents that get commented on are orchestrated - and i have to say this is beyond doubt. 
ive wasted far too much time on it to be honest (i couldnt get my wife interested in my revelation for more than 5minutes or actually anyone i know to be honest - but they arent fans)
Thats why i thought i post it here see if people cared and they do cause they defended what they love.. I started to feel ripped off...im ok now....But this place, Boiler Room its laying claims to being the &quot;home of the underground&quot; when really they are dictacting what the underground is and thats not right.</p>

<p>If that ends up being true, trust me I will feel ripped off too and will be the first person to post that everywhere.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve sent my friend this post and he&#39;s going to be on the lookout. Maybe they don&#39;t do this with every one? I mean, I find it really hard to believe that they can&#39;t find enough fans of these DJs to put together a decent crowd (even though, yeah some of them are small, 20-30 people, and I could believe that in some of these there is no crowd in front of the DJ, I honestly wouldn&#39;t be shocked. And that&#39;s a bit deceitful, but leagues away from hiring actors to dance imo)</p>

<p>Anyway, sorry for being a dick above. It just seemed like you were completely unwilling to consider any other evidence. You and I are in the same place as far as how we would perceive Boiler Room if it were staged. I&#39;m just not convinced yet.</p>

<p>Oh, and as far as doing drugs... I&#39;ve got plenty of experience there. Unless you&#39;re totally gone you still know what&#39;s real and not. And often times on things like LSD you&#39;re more aware and perceptive of things. Lots of really smart people have come up with brilliant ideas or understandings of the world while tripping. I have plenty of experience with speed too... sometimes I had better perception, and sometimes delusional ideas came out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will make this my last thought as definitely it was a manic episode i really must escape from. im trying to. I thought it was so obvious that everyone would agree especially when i pointed out what i saw, now i have to except id been watching it over and over i was reading into it way too much. i cant pinpoint a particular incident that proves what i am saying beyond doubt. The most i think i could say now is staff, which could be 10-20 people if you include there +1 are expected to behave in a certain manner/style....and i could be wrong..........im coming way back to earth and i dont wont to think or look anymore
<a href="https://youtu.be/m0AavdaZo34">https://youtu.be/m0AavdaZo34</a>
this one here though i think the stooge audience is already in place on the left. From about 2minutes, you see the host gesture to the guy behind him in the background far right, with black and white stripe shirt to arrange to push out the guys up the standing around chatting and drinking, which takes till about the 5minute mark to achieve and then the stooge crowd arrives on the right. I think the left is already in place. At around 23:50 the wasted looking guy with the hat on the front left appears to ask the host guy if its allright to go the toilet or something then leaves..At 18.50 the 2 stooges on the right leave and on cue roll in 3 young chicks who really dont know who Oscar Mulero and unless the following dj was somebody really commercial - wouldnt be there. This orchestrated move gets the thumbs up from the host at 18.55. I just dont think the people up the front in this video are the types you get close to a DJ like this none of them really seem to get the music. When the music drops or you think the crowd should go off they dont but but they cut to show the large audience view and the people out the back are pumping their fists and cheering. They appear out of their natural character and like its not something they would normally go to and if they did wouldnt be up the front.
Normally, the better dances, the ones who are into the music and dj find their way to the front and the dj gets more respect/appreciation...these people dont seem to care, fiddle around too often and also try too hard appearing unnatural. In a natural environment the people you see here would fall away or wouldnt be in that position in the first place. i just cant see how these people would be standing there if its not orchestrated. 
really i got to stop looking at these videos i dont care and am making in issue out of nothing and i waste far too much writing this stuff.....in this one you also see the girl with the black curly hair who is in 3 of tullum videos on the far right at one point. 
This is obviously are larger audience and more difficult to control and a fairly pissed guy gets through to the front towards the end which is another reason why they do it...What happens here i think won of the stooge girls rolls in to distract him, but really i got to stop to even think like this...None of this is really worth thinking about it to be honest and doesnt matter either whether its true or not </p>
