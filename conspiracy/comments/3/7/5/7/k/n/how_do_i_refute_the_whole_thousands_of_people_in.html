<p>You see it all the time from Liars (my word for anti-Truthers, haha), but all I can do is roll my eyes; I can nary dignify it with a response.  Do they really think that the CIA operates the way that a typical organisation does? They have &quot;Cells&quot; just like the terrorists do...  black boxes where no information is dispersed into the agency except at the highest levels (if that). Within such a cell, whether technically in the CIA, or wherever- you could have the dozen or so people who&#39;d need to know what was going on. The remote pilots (4). The demo guys (4?). 3 Engineers to procure and implement the hardware. One John Clark-esque guy to run it, and oversee anything that did not require discrete knowledge of the events (such as appropriating any drones/missiles..)</p>

<p>tl;dr, How is 12 people not enough? Does our community believe that it would require thousands of intelligence operatives to know what was going on? Discuss.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>John Stockwell referred to the Church Committee investigation which counted CIA Operations between 1947-1972: 9,000 small-scale operations and 3,000 large-scale operations--every one of them secret, every one of them, by definition, a conspiracy. As the fucking CIA has now been around for almost 70 years--you can Triple these numbers: 27,000 small-scale operations and 9,000 large-scale operations which the public has virtually no information about. The files we are given access to are also heavily fucking redacted.</p>

<p>We know the CIA and the DoD are extremely secretive and extremely compartmentalized. During the Vietnam War, Daniel Ellsberg finally read the Pentagon Papers which clearly showed that the U.S. would have to commit 500K to 1 million soldiers to control South Vietnam--yet, this remained SECRET (even from the President) with only a few traitorous fucking generals knowing this info.</p>

<p>Using compartmentalization, the US government was able to employ thousands of people during the Manhattan Project. There was only a handful of people who really knew what was going on. </p>

<p>Think about it. Every single person working a job at a major corporation only does their job. They don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on. </p>

<p>I would ask them &quot;Do you think the janitors at Enron knew what was going on?&quot; </p>

<p>how could they keep one this big?</p>

<p>I would argue the fact we are discussing it means they haven&#39;t. </p>

<p>IMO, if there was thermite used it was probably planted by covert teams and/or Mossad. Those guys usually don&#39;t go around telling secrets. Sometimes, they even fall out of helicopters. </p>

<p>Also: there doesn&#39;t have to be anyone who specifically did anything. All the people on the planes are dead. They won&#39;t refute anything. A lot of people in the Trade Centers died. They won&#39;t refute anything. A lot of people who were in the Trade Centers and survived report explosions, especially coming from the lobby and/or basement area <em>before</em> the Towers fall. </p>

<p>And aside from that: even if it was simply some Saudi terrorists hijacking planes, flying them into buildings, buildings collapsing, there&#39;s nothing that gets in the way of the fact <em>the government lied about not having prior knowledge.</em></p>

<p>If you would like me to link to any of the politicians lies, I will. I can also link to 9/11 Commission lies. It&#39;s fucking common knowledge now that there are complete lies with the official story. It&#39;s not always about the &quot;how&quot; but the &quot;who&quot; and the &quot;why&quot;. </p>

<p>And if that&#39;s the truth (since know one really knows, that&#39;s why we are discussing it), then there isn&#39;t anyone who could possibly come forward with anything. If our government willingly cooperated with these terrorists (like say....monitoring and allowing the wire transfers from Germany to pay for the flight school at Max Westhiemer in Norman, OK, then using a white male informant to purchase tickets for one of the flights) then the only person in that case who would have anything to spill is the CIA agent overseeing the Hamburg cell of Al-Qaeda and the informant. </p>

<p>And Nick Berg was found beheaded. After his parents had been told he was being held by the FBI. </p>

<p>So. Yeah. </p>

<p>The idea the Manhattan Project was a well-kept secret is a myth. And it&#39;s also one thing to keep something compartmentalized in the planning stages. How long were things kept secret after execution? The next morning, specifics of the project were front-page news in the New York Times.</p>

<p>So by that regard, 9/11 has probably had about 1,000,000 leaks. </p>

<p>And they kinda had no reason to protect any more secrets, we had literally just dropped the bomb. </p>

<p>I believe (hope) in the future, people will look back on this time and say the exact same thing about 9/11. </p>

<p>&quot;Look at all the &quot;loose talk&quot; leaks! Everyone being interviewed <em>as the events were occurring</em> were reporting liquid metal and explosions! Politicians even slipped up and claimed a missile hit the Pentagon!&quot; </p>

<p>And it&#39;s a decent enough secret even today. I would bet only a few out of 100 random people would really know many of the details of the Manhattan Project. Even less if you mention MK-Ultra, COINTEL PRO, Operation Gladio, Iran-Contra and the Mena Connection, the Murrah Bombing and 9/11 Connection.....</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t mean it happened. There was a shit ton of factual errors made by &quot;reputable sources&quot; in the reports on the day, as happens with every fast-breaking news story. </p>

<p>• At 8:45 am, the Ottawa Citizen reported that a “Cessna-type” aircraft crashed into the World Trade Center (they weren’t alone.)</p>

<p>• At 9:42am, NBC’s Jim Miklaszewski told viewers that “it appears that a bomb was detonated at the [Pentagon] heliport.”</p>

<p>• Six minutes later, Tom Brokaw said there was a report on Dubai television that Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine had claimed responsibility. </p>

<p>• 10:12am — CNN reported, “There’s a report of an explosion on Capitol Hill.” </p>

<p>• Three times, according to Fairness &amp; Accuracy in Reporting, CBS’ Dan Rather told viewers of a car bomb at the State Department.</p>

<p>None of it true in the slightest. </p>

<li>It identifies (with some geographical error) the name and location of an obviously classified scientific/military facility</li>
<li>It gives an approximate and plausible size of the facility, which gives some hint of its importance</li>
<li>It emphasizes the amount of compartmentalization going on at the facility, which again hints at its importance</li>
<li>It correctly identifies the scientific director, which to an observed eye would narrow it down to something relating to theoretical physics</li>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact remains, using the Manhattan project as an example of perfect secrecy is wrong.

<p>That is certainly not the case here: journalists would fall over themselves to break legitimate information showing 9/11 was an inside job. It would make Watergate look like a bungled burglary.... </p>

<p>If they decide to blame Muslims for what was essentially a government coup, then they will stick with that and anyone who goes against it will be retaliated against or fired.

<p>9/11 brought martial law to America. It ended the constitution. It created a parallel unaccountable, hidden court system. That continues today and shows no signs of being shut down, but is being entrenched and expanded.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How many people were involved in keeping the development of Stealth Aircraft secret for decades?  All of which was based off the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horten_Ho_229"><strong>Horton HO 229</strong></a> that was captured after the end of WWII.  </p>

<p>Thousands of Govt. employee and 3rd party contractors kept it secret from 1945 - late 1980&#39;s</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whenever someone says 9/11 would have taken too many conspirators, i accuse them of being a holocaust denier, because certainly the holocaust would have taken more conspirators than 9/11 did.</p>

<p>And then follow it up by agreeing with them that the holocaust must have been a hoax because it would have taken too many people to pull off.</p>

<p>How can they argue with that logic? From my experimentation with this line of reasoning, it pretty well shuts up the idiots and shills, because they really dont want this logic applied to other conspiracy theories. They find it better to stop the  conversation rather than to let it grow and attract more attention and participation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t address it at all, other than to point out that &quot;personal incredulity&quot; is a logical fallacy.  </p>

<p>A person saying, &quot;I don&#39;t think it could&#39;ve happened&quot; in no way explains the twin towers turning to dust as they fell, or the complete lack of planes at Pentagon and Shanksville, or the demolition of WTC7.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I wrote similar on a different thread:</p>

<p>This argument is brought up all the time on any grand illusion/conspiracy...how could so many people be involved and not say anything?</p>

<p>But it&#39;s really a question that if you applied to anything in everyday life, you see &quot;conspiracy&quot; or rather ignoring behavior, is going on constantly.  How many hundreds of millions of businessmen conceal their future plans daily?  How many doctors don&#39;t tell their patients the full story of their health problems, often to the doctor&#39;s profit?  How many salesmen make exorbitant profits on naive customers in over their head, often deeply negatively effecting that customer&#39;s financial stability.</p>

<p>Yet the lying goes on daily, yearly, in never-ending fashion across every industry...especially in America, a land built by hustlers and hucksters.</p>

<p>That grand technological fakery can take place is not at all surprising to me that it could take place.  It may be surprising when one begins to put the pieces together and see which events and technologies are very likely fake.  But the fact that people would attempt such things, or how they could keep such secrets, or go on living ignoring and forgetting them, none of that is surprising...the normal present state of humanity.</p>
