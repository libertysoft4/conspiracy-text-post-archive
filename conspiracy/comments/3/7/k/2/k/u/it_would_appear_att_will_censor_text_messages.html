<li>I was checking out the popular on Youtube list and had not yet heard of the &quot;effective. power&quot; bug. I work in the tech field and like finding out more about things like this, so I went to test it out using my google voice number.</li>
<li>I sent a few messages back and forth with no effect before noticing I&#39;d copied a capital E in effective, so I fixed that and continued.</li>
<li>Message sent <em>to</em> gvoice number, received just fine.</li>
<li>Message sent <em>from</em> gvoice number, shows in gvoice conversation, nothing on phone.</li>
<li>Tried a few test messages. All went through just fine. Try effective. power string again. Nothing received on phone.</li>
<li>Delete character from the end of the string. Nothing again.</li>
<li>Sent message from my phone to my phone number. Message received just fine with not effect on the phone. No freezing, nothing.</li>
<li>Turned off imessage in settings and tried sending the string again as sms. The message shows up as &quot;sent&quot; on my phone, but was <strong>NOT RECEIVED</strong> by my phone.</li>
<li>To me, this has established that google is not blocking messages, and it&#39;s not something imessage is blocking either. I don&#39;t know why the string doesn&#39;t seem to effect my phone when sent from the phone or received in imessage. Possibly related to the fact that  my iphone 5 still has ios 7.1.1 because I&#39;m beyond out of love with my iphone. That should have nothing to do with the messages not being received.
<em>This means either the bug is somehow *also</em> effecting AT&amp;T&#39;s SMS system, which is very unlikely considering that this bug has effected enough people to be fairly well known and probably didn&#39;t only effect non-AT&amp;T iphone users...or it means that AT&amp;T has the ability to filter sms messages sent <strong>TO</strong> their users based on the content of that message, regardless of the sms carrier used by the sender(assuming that gvoice numbers aren&#39;t AT&amp;T or something). This is probably well intended, but that doesn&#39;t eliminate the broad implications of a company having the ability to prevent messages from reaching their intended receiver. This may be an altogether new area of &quot;spam&quot; that needs to be filtered more like a virus. This could also be something where an employee with the right access can block gentleman callers from contacting an ex. Or whatever.</li>
<li>The bottom line to me is that this now begs the question: Why is the postal system sacred in terms of messages not being tampered with, but text messages, regardless of content, are able to be filtered at the discretion of a corporate 3rd party in a way such that the intended receiver has no idea whatsoever that the were even supposed to be contacted.</li>
<li>Anyone with an AT&amp;T iphone that is willing to try to test this out, please help me prove or disprove this. I&#39;m not hung up on being right and would rather be disproved because of some oversight than start some sort of half baked witch hunt. You can apparently fix the bug, whatever lasting effects there are anyway, by just receiving more texts or something. I have plenty of tools to fix my things so I dive into these things a little fast and since the bug didn&#39;t affect me I didn&#39;t read the whole fix. Google will probably help you there.</li>

<p>It&#39;s the unicode, not the Arabic.
Reposting my comment from another thread.
The other part of the text is irrelevant. Although messages is incapable of rendering it, the unicode in that text goes on indefinitely without stopping. Similar to a badly coded, indefinitely counting counter in JavaScript that causes your browser to crash, this causes messages to take up a lot more memory than normal, leading to iOS killing the largest process, the springboard.
I&#39;m making this hypothesis based on the fact that this crash was successfully done on my jailbroken iPad, but was unable to be done on my phone, where I have more memory allocated to the springboard to help prevent crashes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand all that...the code part of it makes sense and I don&#39;t have a problem there or need any explanation. My problem is the fact that based on that string existing in the message, they were dropped without warning before being received by me. This is the problem. Forget the bug for a second and think about if it&#39;d had been some other random arbitrary string of text that didn&#39;t affect your phone but was still filtered...say that you figure out through testing that ever text message that says &quot;Switch to T-Mobile&quot; got dropped or something....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly! We know that the NSA and other government organizations have used access in inappropriate ways. What would keep someone from filtering all messages relating to a political platform or ideology from getting filtered? Or whatever else? And they could reasonably argue that this is for &quot;protection&quot; but at the end of the day, we need to start thinking of SMS and iMessages more like how we think of the mail, and that tampering with the messages should be forbidden. In a world where you can have the content of SMS messages used against you as evidence in court, or conversely, supporting your case in court, we need to know that the messages that are sent are either untampered with, or that at the VERY LEAST there&#39;s a failure notification to either party, similar to fax machine confirmations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the title of the message reflects my concern. I don&#39;t care about the bug. I write software, bugs happen. But I also established that messages were unknowingly being dropped without the recipient being informed in anyway, and this only happened to messages sent to my iphone. I don&#39;t need and explanation as to &quot;for&quot; at&amp;t censoring messages. I just feel that at this point I&#39;ve proven that it is occurring, and since there would otherwise be no reason for me to know beforehand, in all likelihood this is happening all time to whomever. ALSO, I&#39;ve seen articles, posts, videos, etc that it works on other iOS implementations. In fact, it makes sense that the interpretation of UTF-8 characters didn&#39;t change much between iOS version. And to your first point, IT&#39;S NOT ABOUT THE BUG AND WHY IT DID OR DID NOT HAPPEN ON MY PHONE! The message not getting through is the point. There doesn&#39;t have to be a bug for me to take issue with the fact that a message was not delivered. Or maybe you just didn&#39;t read the post clearly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh I thought you did actual testing. </p>

<p>See in my testing, not all of my messages came through until my friend sent himself a Siri message in our thread did all the messages come through. </p>

<p>Not all messaging systems outside of standard SMS are perfect. Messages and Hangouts have routing issues from time to time not affecting everyone. It&#39;s the nature of letting someone else handle your messaging. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tested inasmuch as I presented various use cases in a manner that isolated variables and confirmed correlation with results. Causation is obviously not implied, but the fact remains that iMessage sent and received the string, gvoice sent and received the string, SMS on the AT&amp;T network sent, but was <strong>not</strong> received, nor was it received when sent from gvoice. However, test messages that did <strong>not</strong> contain the string were sent and received just fine, whether with my own direct number or the gvoice number. So that rules out alternate protocols/standards apart from SMS. The only thing that I wish that I had done at the time (since there are unknown variables that could have changed even with this much time) would be to have sent and received the string to my gvoice number from my gvoice number. That would have completely ruled out AT&amp;T and either gotten blocked, implying that there is somehow a method of this kind of filtration/selective delivery being deployed across possibly all carriers based on the SMS standards(which is much scarier in my opinion) or went through just fine further pointing to this being an AT&amp;T specific thing. However, gvoice probably filters for it&#39;s own numbers and handles text messages differently when it wouldn&#39;t have to use SMS.</p>

<p>As far as &quot;the nature of letting someone else handle your messaging.&quot; We also &quot;let someone else&quot; handle our mail and phone calls in general, and because they were both primary sources of communication at one time or another, laws were put in place to prevent the tampering of the messages sent. People need to be able to rely on the validity of communication by whatever means they&#39;re transferred and there used to be an expectation that a user of whatever communication method could rely on the message to have the absolutely highest possible fidelity. SMS messages are used as evidence in various courts of law. They&#39;ve been used as grounds for suspension, expulsion, termination, lawsuits.... In other words, if the people paying for these services can be punished for the content of a message, then the message should not be allowed to be altered in any way. A message could be blocked that might add context to a previous or following message that would otherwise appear incriminating. Or worse, messages could be sent to you and blocked, but you&#39;re still held responsible do to some record not showing the blockage. There are many reasons this is scary. There is also the fact that the internet is being deemed a utility, and in some countries a right. This separates it from <em>optional services</em> that try to get away with murder by adding a line item into the EULA. If spotify wants to track your habits and you don&#39;t like that, you can live without it. At this day in age, SMS messages are hard to live without, and it&#39;s usage as a whole is ever increasing and probably never going to decrease until it&#39;s replaced by what would only be an almost identical service, maybe with additional file sharing or something. Anyone who would argue that SMS messages can be lived without....Well, I&#39;m not going to google how not to offend that person, nor statistics on the usage of SMS, but you can pay for things, set appointments, use two-party verification systems, etc with SMS, and at this point it appears that AT&amp;T has a way to evaluate the content of an SMS message and make decisions quickly to blanketly filter them based on arbitrary strings in the messages content. Your messages are being evaluated in real time and I have no clue how fast the filter was implemented, but the articles I saw online about the bug were at most 15 hours old. That&#39;s really fast. And the string wasn&#39;t known before hand, since it was clearly sent around. So it something as simple as dropping the text string somewhere and block goes the filter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At this point, assuming that they are still filtering this message string out, then try to send the message to yourself as SMS <em>not</em> imessage and see if it gets through. You just have to know the bug seems to be  sort of unpredictable in how it can effect the phones, at least between my phone (iphone 5 - att) and my fiance&#39;s (iphone 6 - verizon). Also if anyone has another phone and wants to see if their carrier filters them.</p>
