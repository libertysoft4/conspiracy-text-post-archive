<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The occurrence of such extreme, sharp spikes in VOCs in air at GZ indicate something other than the behavior of a typical structure fire. Oxygen influx as a result of shifting of materials within the pile might have created an increase in combustion of material in localized areas. But these spikes in VOCs, at levels thousands of times higher than seen in other structure fires, suggest extremely violent but short-lived fire events. Probably the most striking spike in toxic air emissions, found in EPA monitoring data, occurred on 9th February, 2002. Note (Table 1 ) that this was nearly 5 months after 9/11, and after nearly all the debris had been cleared from GZ. In fact, the levels of some species, like toluene and styrene, were some of the highest observed at the site. But the levels of benzene and propylene detected on that day were far above previous measurements, at 610,000 and 990,000 ppb, respectively. Other VOCs were measured at their peak levels on this date, including 1,3-butadiene at 400,000 ppb.&quot; &quot;EPA also monitored very fine particulate matter (PM) and other sizes of PM. PM is probably the most reliable indicator for the activity of structure fires, as such fires are generally known to burn incompletely, and produce PM that drifts up and outward from the source. EPA data from the West Broadway sampling site, the location closest to GZ where PM was monitored, show the following trend in very fine PM (PM 2.5 , or all particles \ 2.5 l m) in October and November 2001 (Fig. 4 ). These data show that the peaks in levels of very fine PM near GZ correspond to different dates than the peaks for the previously discussed combustion products. The five stron- gest peaks in PM 2.5 levels are centered on 23th, 26th September, and 3rd, 10th, 20th October, closer in time to the events of 9/11. None of these dates correspond to the dates of five peaks in VOCs noted above. Additionally, it is clear that the levels of PM 2.5 emissions rose more gradu- ally, and died down more gradually, indicating slower fire dynamics as might be expected from the burning of the organic materials previously thought to exist in the WTC. These data suggest that the greatest level of fire activity, associated solely with the typical fuel sources expected in the WTC, was completed by the third week of October. That is, the materials expected to burn (incompletely) in a structure fire, producing PM, were largely burned off by mid- to late-October. <strong>Therefore, the extreme spikes in air concentrations of the five VOCs noted above, particularly on 3rd, 8th November, and 9th February, point not to other sources of typical combustible materials but to other forms of com- bustion.</strong> Such forms of combustion appear to be violent and short-lived, and thus similar to the effects of energetic materials, like thermite&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cant believe i actually wasted my time reading that, but i did, im a sucker for research papers. basically there hypothesis is they suspect the existence of thermite because of compounds present there: (styrene, benzene, etc..). The majority of the elements discuessed are sed in jet fuels and mainly plastics (oil and fuel), You can almost find these compounds anywhere. Do you know what happens to steels like aluminium when they start melting or really decompose and are combined with water.............................ill give you a hit..................its creates thermite like conditions. but that wasnt real analysis, because here comes the good stuff,...you ready</p>

<p>..........................................................................................</p>

<ul>
<li>EPA’s Erik Swartz stated that 1,3-DPP was present at
levels ‘‘that dwarfed all others.’’ Swartz went on to say—
‘‘We’ve never observed it in any sampling we’ve ever
done’’  - Pg 4</li>
</ul>

<p>The researcher leads you to believe that the substance (molecule)  was found in “analysis of the WTC dust”. You get the impression that the substance was found on the ground, but you know conspiracy theories, usually they are far from the truth as evidence by this case</p>

<p>Here is the actual full quote.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>The September 11, 2001 attack on the World Trade Center (WTC) resulted in an intense fire and the subsequent, complete collapse of the two main structures and adjacent buildings, as well as significant damage to many surrounding buildings within and around the WTC complex. This 16-acre area has become known as Ground Zero. In response to this disaster, the US EPA quickly positioned air monitors and samplers around Ground Zero to characterize the resulting air plumes. One such instrument was a High Capacity Integrated Organic Gas and Particle (HiC IOGAP) sampler with a 2.5 mm cyclone for particle discrimination to collect semi-volatile gases and particles for speciation of organic compounds.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Analysis</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Samples were taken from the air, then. And according to the document “these emissions lasted for over three weeks (9/26/01-10/20/01) after the initial destruction of the WTC”. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So thermite-related traces were found in the air more than three weeks later? That seems surprising, especially as earlier Jones takes time to reassure us that the amount of explosives required to bring down each tower wouldn’t be too significant:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>&quot;for a WTC tower, about 1000 pounds of explosives would be sufficient. This would only require an estimated 10 men (foreigners?) to install the cutter charges, mostly in the central core/ elevator shaft areas.&quot;</em></li>
</ul>

<p>So did the researcher leave anything out in order to mislead the reader, why dont we look at the full quotes</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>One molecule, described by the EPA&#39;s Erik Swartz, was present at levels &quot;that dwarfed all others&quot;: 1,3-diphenylpropane. &quot;We&#39;ve never observed it in any sampling we&#39;ve ever done,&quot; Swartz said. He said it was most likely produced by the plastic of tens of thousands of burning computers.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh, so wait, i had hypothesized earlier something about plastics,......hmmmm</p>

<p>oh wait,..do we have more evidence from the EPA that the researcher left out...well guess what, we do</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>In addition, the compound 1,3-diphenyl propane [1&#39;,1&#39;-(1,3-propanediyl)bis-benzene] is found in significant concentrations. This species has not previously been reported from ambient sampling. It has been associated with polyvinyl chloride materials, which are believed to be in abundance at the WTC site. Source:

<p>Do we have more damaging evidence, yes we do</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>In addition, the compound 1,3-diphenylpropane- [ 1&#39;,1&#39;-(1,3-propanediyl)bis-benzene] was observed, and to our knowledge, this species has not previously been reported from ambient sampling.

<p>When it comes to research, the credibility of the research being perfomed and the credibility of the data presented needs to be trusted. When the researcher clearly intends to mislead you cant trust the data being presented because he or she will only present data that supports their hypothesis.</p>

<p>There is a difference between arriving at a conclusion from research and having a pre-concieved notion and then making up research data to support.</p>

<p>The author of this study was clearly the latter. Sorry that i dont intend to waste my time delving into the works of someone clearly with an agenda grind.</p>

<p>They are published, they were in a journal. Whether or not it was peer-reviewed, im not sure, i cant tell. But the reviewers did a bad job, clearly.</p>

</ul>

<p>I could, but it too wold be a waste of time, because i cant trust any of the stats being provided by the researcher, meaning i would have to verify everything presented by the author because he simply lacks credibility. And you know he does. Now my question is, why do you trust or go to his research when you can clearly see he intends to mislead?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I literally answered you at least three times now. 0 misleading. You are attempting to create an argument that the authors are not making. </p>

<p><a href="https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/strawman">You misrepresented someone&#39;s argument to make it easier to attack. ...  Here&#39;s a button for you: ...</a></p>

<p><strong>&quot;The authors aren&#39;t stating that burning plastics don&#39;t produce VOCs. They show in their peer review, published paper that the official story combustion cannot account for the spikes. If you had read the paper or even the quote I gave you, you&#39;d know this. There was no ad hominem. I was giving you the benefit of the doubt stating you hadn&#39;t read it since you didn&#39;t address it. Who knows... Maybe you&#39;re ignoring it on purpose. Maybe it&#39;s your poor reading comprehension skills. Either way... I&#39;m still waiting....&quot;</strong></p>

<p>&quot;The occurrence of such extreme, sharp spikes in VOCs in air at GZ indicate something other than the behavior of a typical structure fire. Oxygen influx as a result of shifting of materials within the pile might have created an increase in combustion of material in localized areas. But these spikes in VOCs, at levels thousands of times higher than seen in other structure fires, suggest extremely violent but short-lived fire events. Probably the most striking spike in toxic air emissions, found in EPA monitoring data, occurred on 9th February, 2002. Note (Table 1 ) that this was nearly 5 months after 9/11, and after nearly all the debris had been cleared from GZ. In fact, the levels of some species, like toluene and styrene, were some of the highest observed at the site. But the levels of benzene and propylene detected on that day were far above previous measurements, at 610,000 and 990,000 ppb, respectively. Other VOCs were measured at their peak levels on this date, including 1,3-butadiene at 400,000 ppb.&quot; <strong>&quot;EPA also monitored very fine particulate matter (PM) and other sizes of PM. PM is probably the most reliable indicator for the activity of structure fires, as such fires are generally known to burn incompletely, and produce PM that drifts up and outward from the source. EPA data from the West Broadway sampling site, the location closest to GZ where PM was monitored, show the following trend in very fine PM (PM 2.5 , or all particles \ 2.5 l m) in October and November 2001 (Fig. 4 ). These data show that the peaks in levels of very fine PM near GZ correspond to different dates than the peaks for the previously discussed combustion products. The five stron- gest peaks in PM 2.5 levels are centered on 23th, 26th September, and 3rd, 10th, 20th October, closer in time to the events of 9/11. None of these dates correspond to the dates of five peaks in VOCs noted above. Additionally, it is clear that the levels of PM 2.5 emissions rose more gradu- ally, and died down more gradually, indicating slower fire dynamics as might be expected from the burning of the organic materials previously thought to exist in the WTC. These data suggest that the greatest level of fire activity, associated solely with the typical fuel sources expected in the WTC, was completed by the third week of October. That is, the materials expected to burn (incompletely) in a structure fire, producing PM, were largely burned off by mid- to late-October. Therefore, the extreme spikes in air concentrations of the five VOCs noted above, particularly on 3rd, 8th November, and 9th February, point not to other sources of typical combustible materials but to other forms of com- bustion.</strong> Such forms of combustion appear to be violent and short-lived, and thus similar to the effects of energetic materials, like thermite&quot;</p>

<p>The burning plastics can produce VOC. This isn&#39;t the argument. The PM shows that the official story combustion had already taken place and thus, <strong>is not</strong> the source. </p>

<p>The authors even link the the article you quoted from in your &quot;ah-ha! gotcha!&quot; attempt. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;One molecule, described by the EPA&#39;s Erik Swartz, was present at levels &quot;that dwarfed all others&quot;: 1,3-diphenylpropane. &quot;We&#39;ve never observed it in any sampling we&#39;ve ever done,&quot; Swartz said. He said it was most likely produced by the plastic of tens of thousands of burning computers.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All I had to do to find that was click the link provided by the authors. So hard! Much research! </p>

<p>And now...when one actually <strong>reads</strong> the paper, we see this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Instead, Swartz attributed the presence of 1,3-DPP to
polystyrene and other plastics, by stating</strong></p>

<p><strong>[1,3-DPP was] primarily found in the gas phase (with
90% of the mass found on the front denuder). Although
the source of the compound in this study is not known,
it may have formed during the combustion of polystyrene
or other polymers. 1,3-Diphenylpropane has
been found to co-occur with polystyrene plastics
(37, 38), so another possibility is that the compound
was already present and encapsulated in large volumes
of plastics in the buildings and was off-gassed during
the pulverization process. (Swartz et al. 2003)</strong></p>

<p><strong>However, the sources Swartz uses to support 1,3-DPP as
a combustion product of polystyrene are not studies of
polystyrene combustion, but of gasses released in the longterm
degradation of enclosed polystyrene food product
packaging.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then.....</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Other studies have shown trace amounts of 1,3-DPP as a
secondary product of polystyrene combustion or thermolysis.
But such studies suggest that 1,3-DPP may only form
in negligible quantities and under certain conditions (Boettner
et al. 1973; McCaffrey et al. 1996). In such
experiments, the major product of the combustion or
thermolysis of polystyrene, far outweighing others, is the
monomer styrene. This leads us to the fact that, although
styrene was a species of interest at 290 Broadway during
the same time period as was 1,3-DPP, styrene detections
were not reported in the FOIA provided data (EPA 2004).
Therefore, it appears that Swartz’ first suggested hypothesis,
that 1,3-DPP resulted from combustion of polystyrene,
is not probable.
The possibility that 1,3-DPP was off-gassed as a result
of the physical destruction of debris at GZ, as in Swartz’
second hypothesis, seems possible. But it is one thing to
suggest that 1,3-DPP was ‘‘encapsulated in large volumes
of plastics in the buildings’’ and another thing to state in
what exact materials this rare compound was encapsulated.
Consumer plastics do not typically have large amounts of
unusual organic compounds just simply ‘‘encapsulated’’
within them.
A review of the literature uncovers one interesting
source of encapsulated 1,3-DPP that may help to explain
much of the unusual environmental data described above.
The synthesis of novel nanostructured materials has
involved the use of 1,3-DPP to functionalize mesoporous
silicas through control of pore size (Kidder et al. 2003).
The resulting novel hybrid materials possess silyl aryl
ether linkages to the silica surface that are thermally
stable to ca. 550C, but can be easily cleaved at room
temperature with aqueous base for quantitative
recovery of the organic moieties. (Kidder et al. 2005)
Such novel nanostructured materials are known to have
been the focus of intense research in the past 10 years,
particularly with regard to energetic nanocomposites.
Energetic nanocomposites are hybrid sol–gel materials,
often made with a silica base, that have been combined
with metal oxides and nano-scale aluminum powder to
form superthermite materials. Much of this work has been
done at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories (Gash
et al. 2000; Clapsaddle et al. 2004, 2005; Simpson et al.
2004).</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>So, to recap:</strong></p>

<p>Not only are you attempting a strawman logical fallacy, but you are also lying when you state that the authors are trying to be deceitful. They provided a direct link to the article you posted your quote from. The quote where <strong>Laurie Garrett - Staff Writer</strong> states that, &quot;He said it was most likely produced by the plastic of tens of thousands of burning computers.&quot;</p>

<p>Not even a direct quote from Swartz! So what do the authors do? They provide you with his <strong>direct quote!</strong> </p>

<p>And then, they refute it. </p>

<p>So, now that you&#39;re done lying / stalling, will you actually read the paper? Because all the evidence shows that you haven&#39;t. Either that or you&#39;re purposely trying to be deceitful and hoping that I haven&#39;t read the paper. </p>

<p>Still waiting...</p>

<p>In September 2001, PBS’ Frontline interviews the former general counsel for the CIA, mentioning reports from 1998 that the DEA found out Osama bin Laden was undergoing kidney dialysis with a doctor in Peshwar. They mention further that the DEA wanted to poison bin Laden through his dialysis machine, but the CIA allegedy rejected this due to the ban on assassinations. Link: <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/terrorism/interviews/smith.html">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/terrorism/interviews/smith.html</a></p>

<p>In November 2001, The Guardian is reporting that French intelligence officials say bin Laden was flown to Dubai for kidney treatment in July of 2001, where he also met with several CIA agents and the head of Saudi intelligence. This story is also picked up by several French newspapers. Link: <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/nov/01/afghanistan.terrorism">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/nov/01/afghanistan.terrorism</a></p>

<p>In his first interview since 9/11, in November 2001 bin Laden talks to a Pakistani newspaper and claims that his “kidneys are all right” and denies visiting a hospital in Dubai the previous year (note that he may have visited one in Pakistan). In the same interview he also asserts, clearly lying, that he has “nuclear weapons.” Link: <a href="http://dawn.com/news/5647/osama-claims-he-has-nukes-if-us-uses-n-arms-it-will-get-same-response/2">http://dawn.com/news/5647/osama-claims-he-has-nukes-if-us-uses-n-arms-it-will-get-same-response/2</a></p>

<p>This is a pattern. Something is reported, then magically it is backed off on when it does not fit the narrative. Like when he died--

<p>And again
In December of 2001, the New York Times reports on “high-level murmurings that bin Laden is dead.” Link: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/26/international/asia/26LADE.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/26/international/asia/26LADE.html</a></p>

<p>In late December of 2001, after reports of bin Laden’s funeral, a new video appears of a gaunt, sickly Osama bin Laden. The London Telegraph reports, verbatim: “The recording was dismissed by the Bush administration yesterday as sick propaganda possibly designed to mask the fact the al-Qa’eda leader was already dead.” One aid further concludes that the video was created earlier in the event bin Laden is dead, who by December of 2001 was so heavily surrounded he would have been unable to escape to obtain kidney dialysis. Link: <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/1366508/US-casts-doubt-on-bin-Ladens-latest-message.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/1366508/US-casts-doubt-on-bin-Ladens-latest-message.html</a></p>

<p>At this time CBS news also runs a story on bin Laden receiving kidney disease treatments in Pakistan the week before 9/11. Link:<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmhXSUIFLZ4">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmhXSUIFLZ4</a></p>

<p>In January of 2002, The Guardian reports that the president of Pakistan speculates that bin Laden is now dead of untreated kidney disease based on video and photographs of a gaunt-looking bin Laden. Link: <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/jan/19/afghanistan.oliverburkeman">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/jan/19/afghanistan.oliverburkeman</a></p>

<p>In January of 2002, based on his analysis of video and photographs of bin Laden from December 2001, CNN’s Dr. Sanjay Gupta says that bin Laden seems to be having renal failure. He notes kidney dialysis is expensive, and suggests bin Laden would need help in obtaining medical treatment. Link: <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2002/HEALTH/01/21/gupta.otsc/">http://edition.cnn.com/2002/HEALTH/01/21/gupta.otsc/</a></p>

<p>In March 2002, the BBC reports on an interview with bin Laden’s wife, who speaks of bin Laden in the past tense, notes his failing kidney and frequent use of pills and other medicines. She says she has not seen her husband since September 2001, but holds out hope that he is still alive: “I feel deep inside me that he is still alive.” She also notes that bin Laden’s wish was to die in Afghanistan and nowhere else: “He never spoke to me about his intention to leave Afghanistan and always wished to die there. He told me once that if he ever left Afghanistan, it would be to meet his Creator.” She also says that bin Laden “always suffered from kidney and stomach pains and that he “told me once that he was going to Pakistan for treatment.” Link: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/monitoring/media_reports/1871182.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/monitoring/media_reports/1871182.stm</a></p>

<p>In March and April of 2002, U.S. officials downplay the threat of bin Laden, with Rumsfeld even saying the bin Laden threat has been “neutralized.” Even Bush, called out for rarely mentioning bin Laden in 2002, admits: “We haven’t heard from him [bin Laden] in a long time… I don’t know where he is. I really just don’t spend that much time on him, to be honest with you.” Link: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PGmnz5Ow-o">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PGmnz5Ow-o</a></p>

<p>In May 2002, ABC News reports on a new spliced-together tape from unknown time periods in which bin Laden appears “about the same” (that is, sickly-looking) as in the tape from December 2011. ABC News also says they have “learned intelligence reports indicate bin Laden had received a kidney transplant in Pakistan,” but do not know when. Link: <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=79973&amp;amp;page=1">http://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=79973&amp;amp;page=1</a></p>

<p>In July 2002, the BBC reveals a bombshell: the FBI’s counter-terrorism chief Dale Watson says bin Laden is ‘”probably dead.” Conveniently, bin Laden’s followers’ claim that bin Laden will “not make more video statements until his group launches another attack on the United States.” Link: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2135473.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2135473.stm</a></p>

<p>In July 2002, CNN reports that bin Laden’s close bodyguards were captured in February of 2002, but not bin Laden. The article also quotes mentions some high-level officials: “Some high-level U.S. officials are already convinced by such evidence that bin Laden, who has not been seen or heard from in months, is dead.” Link: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021204040117/http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/07/30/binladen.son/">http://web.archive.org/web/20021204040117/http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/07/30/binladen.son/</a></p>

<p>In July 2002, Time Magazine reports that “intelligence officials are not certain whether Osama bin Laden is alive or dead” but that “they have found a tantalizing document that suggests he was living at least as recently as the last days of December [of 2001].” Link: <a href="http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1002840,00.html">http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1002840,00.html</a></p>

<p>In July 2002, The New York Times runs another article on how Osama bin Laden is likely dead. The author notes how unusual it would be for bin Laden, known for his constant desire for media attention, would be silent for over half a year. Link: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/11/opinion/the-death-of-bin-ladenism.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/11/opinion/the-death-of-bin-ladenism.html</a></p>

<p>How about when they found his will!!
Also in October 2002 the D.C.-based news service The World Tribune, citing Israeli intelligence sources, reports that the United States and Israel have concluded that bin Laden died in Afghanistan in December 2001. They note that additional bin Laden messages are “probably fabrications,” and that bin Laden’s heir has been chosen. Link: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021205223313/http://216.26.163.62/2002/me_terrorism_10_16.html">http://web.archive.org/web/20021205223313/http://216.26.163.62/2002/me_terrorism_10_16.html</a></p>

<p>The president of Afghanistan also concludes that bin Laden is probably dead: “The more we don’t hear of him, and the more time passes, there is the likelihood that he probably is either dead or seriously wounded somewhere.” Link: <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/central/10/06/karzai.binladen/">http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/central/10/06/karzai.binladen/</a></p>

<p>In October 2002 CNN reports that U.S. intelligence officials have obtained Osama bin Laden’s will, which is dated December 14, 2001 (approximately the same date as has been reported bin Laden’s funeral in Tora Bora by Fox News and other outlets). CNN also reports that there has been no evidence of bin Laden since December of 2001.

    <div class="md"><p>So if you drink it, then it&#39;s OK, if you use it to treat your kid, its abuse.</p>

<p>Chlorine Dioxide Chlorine Dioxide or ClO₂ in its pure form is an unstable, greenish-yellow gas. It is more selective when reacting with other chemicals and actually does not react with most organic compounds. As a result of being less reactive, its antimicrobial action is retained longer in the presence of organic matter. Chlorine Dioxide is also used to disinfect water for safety concerns. ClO₂, however, does not chlorinate water but rather oxidizes it. This is why it is used to treat surface water for odor and taste problems. There is also the added benefit that chlorine dioxde is made on the site, and this eliminates the need for storage such as with chlorine.   </p>
