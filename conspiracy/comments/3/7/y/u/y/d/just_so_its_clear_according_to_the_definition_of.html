        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have come across many pro-Israeli people/users (you can call them whatever you want) in real life and online, and whenever I point out that Israel is committing genocide they freak out and start to defend Israel even more adamantly. So I have spent some time putting <a href="http://chycho.blogspot.ca/2012/12/a-dinner-conversation-israel-and.html">the following information together</a> to explain why it is genocide according to the definition of genocide as stated by the UN. Hope you find this useful when you encounter your next <em>pro-Israeli user</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;As I stated, I do not mince words, and in my opinion we are witnessing a slow genocide unfolding in real time. Unfortunately, this description of the bond that exists between these two peoples is not a well-accepted point of view in my corner of the world, understandably of course, because the word ‘Genocide’ implies so much <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630142442/http://untreaty.un.org/cod/avl/ha/cppcg/cppcg.html">(archive.org link)</a>.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The crime of genocide is defined in article II, the provision that sits at the heart of the Convention. Genocide is a crime of intentional destruction of a national, ethnic, racial and religious group, in whole or in part. <a href="http://www.preventgenocide.org/law/convention/text.htm">Article II lists five punishable acts of genocide</a> (<a href="https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/3/ares3.htm">Resolution 260 III</a>).</p>

<p>a. Killing members of the group;</p>

<p>b. Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;</p>

<p>c. Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;</p>

<p>d. Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;</p>

<p>e. Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>… </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Nevertheless, alongside the legal definition of genocide, rooted in the 1948 Convention and confirmed in subsequent case law, there is a more popular or colloquial conception. In practice, this lay understanding of genocide is more akin to crimes against humanity, in that it comprises a broad range of mass atrocities.” </p>

<p>In other words, what they are doing to Palestine is horrid, and we should also look at what is happening closer to home.</p>

<p>33 Did any people ever hear the voice of a god speaking out of the midst of the fire, as you have heard, and still live? </p>

<p><strong>34 Or has any god ever attempted to go and take a nation for himself from the midst of another nation, by trials, by signs, by wonders, and by war, by a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, and by great terrors, according to all that the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?</strong></p>

<p>39 know therefore this day, and lay it to your heart, that the LORD is God in heaven above and on the earth beneath; there is no other. </p>

<p>40 Therefore you shall keep his statutes and his commandments, which I command you this day, that it may go well with you, and with your children after you, and that you may prolong your days in the land which the LORD your God gives you for ever.&quot; </p>
