        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We have all seen the constant pro-vaccine posts on the front page of reddit, usually in the form of short, simple arguments such as all of these: </p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/search?q=vaccine&amp;restrict_sr=on">http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/search?q=vaccine&amp;restrict_sr=on</a></p>

<p>Describing these posts as pro-vaccine arguments is incorrect actually, instead they are closer to being attacks on anti-vaxxers. Many of them pretty much directly say &quot;if you don&#39;t vaccinate your kids, I hope your kid dies.&quot; Another common but slightly less extreme argument is &quot;If you aren&#39;t vaccinated, you should be excluded from school/work/public life.&quot;</p>

<p>The debate around vaccines is usually centered around the theory that vaccines cause autism (or some other health issue). Do vaccines cause autism? I don&#39;t know, and I&#39;m completely untrained in medicine so finding out would really just end up being a choice of which sources to believe. You might know, but the answer to that question is largely irrelevant compared to the larger issue. I&#39;m beginning to think that all this talk of autism is a strawman argument, used as a distraction from the real situation. </p>

<p>The real, world changing, paradigm-shifting decision that society has to make here is how much choice individuals are given with respect to their own bodies and the bodies of their children/family.</p>

<p>I suspect that this pro-vaccine propaganda is fueled by the government/establishment/someone&#39;s desire to &quot;test the water&quot; and see how much free choice the public would actually give up willingly. Consider what it means to be free, or to have power and control over one&#39;s own life. Realistically, the concept of ownership or control is never absolute. You own your house, technically, but not really. Stop paying property taxes and see what happens. You own the money in your bank account, that is until the government chooses to freeze it for any number of reasons. You might think you own your personal possessions, that is until they are confiscated due to some frivolous &quot;investigation&quot;. </p>

<p>(<a href="https://www.aclu.org/issues/criminal-law-reform/reforming-police-practices/asset-forfeiture-abuse">https://www.aclu.org/issues/criminal-law-reform/reforming-police-practices/asset-forfeiture-abuse</a>). </p>

<p>You somewhat own or control your children, until you cross a line somewhere and a social worker takes over. </p>

<p>So it is clear that legally, as a civilian all or most forms of ownership are really just rentals or licenses to possess those goods/rights, granted by the state. The state has the full authority to take them away. The final frontier of private ownership ends up being one&#39;s body and mind. Technically prison takes away one&#39;s free control of one&#39;s own body or actions, but at least they don&#39;t mess with you internally. It can be viewed as a relocation of one&#39;s body, which is still better than some Orwellian scenario where you get cut open and your organs get replaced with government-controlled lungs and kidneys that can be shut down at any time if you misbehave. Similarly, although technically you can be propagandized to, brainwashed, or drugged, your mind is still yours. Technology has not yet reached the point where minds can be read, and thoughts easily implanted.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t own your body, you own nothing. If you don&#39;t have a reasonable level of control over your thoughts and actions, you are no different than livestock. What I find terrifying about pro-vaccine people&#39;s persistence is that they want a world where you can be essentially forced to take some foreign substance at the government&#39;s discretion. &quot;Forced&quot; here does not mean they&#39;ll hold you down and inject you. It is more likely that being unvaccinated will mean you can&#39;t get a job, can&#39;t go to school, can&#39;t go to crowded public places, and so forth. Anyone who does not accept the injection will be left at the very bottom of society, basically working hard-labor jobs for cash under the table like an illegal immigrant, and living on the streets and in the slums.</p>

<p>My point is not about vaccines, but any foreign substance which has the potential to mess with your body and mind. When the public accepts mandatory vaccines, what&#39;s next? Maybe the current administration won&#39;t do anything to harm us, but what about some evil president 50 years from now? It will be that much easier to The slippery slope is not a fallacy, it actually works very well for getting large results through small steps. I&#39;d never plan on eating a large pizza by myself in one sitting, or spending $800 on video game microtransactions, but I&#39;ve done that. Bit by bit, dollar by dollar, it just happens. When you&#39;re already half way into something, it is much easier psychologically to continue. </p>

<p>Some theories for what could be next after vaccines (which will be propagandized and forced in the same way):</p>

<p>-RFID microchips (for identification, making payments, and GPS tracking. May even include a killswitch. Can you imagine this on CNN?: &quot;If everyone was implanted with a microchip that can be activated to paralyze the host, we could stop terrorists in their tracks!&quot;)</p>

<p>-Free thought suppression medication, obedience drugs, IQ-lowering, anything that makes you into a good worker. Maybe something that gives you the energy/desire to work longer hours.</p>

<p>-Something which reduces empathy in police and military.</p>

<p>-Drugs which promote consumerism or other behavior like that.</p>

<p>-Literally cyanide pills if population reduction ever becomes a goal.</p>

<p>To conclude, I would really prefer if this line was just not crossed. I fear that if you start letting them mess around with your body and forcing medication, we will be entering a dark abyss that we will not escape from. You cannot run from something which is inside you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you on the arguments about vaccines. There seems to be only two sides that are at the far end of the spectrum. I believe these two narratives are hurting the discussion. I am very concerned that these nonsensical sides are paving the way for the right of consent to be thrown out the window. </p>

<p>I am only concerned with the right to consent. I believe better reforms in pharmaceuticals and medicine to be more effective in finding issues with vaccines than fighting against them entirely. I also believe that exiling and punishing those who do not get vaccines to be irrational as well. I think the global society is moving towards laws that focus on punishment and restriction, and this issue will be the start of that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I will agree with you that this issue is just a symptom of the issue of personal and parental rights (our choices for our children vs. the government&#39;s, our choices for our bodies vs. the government&#39;s) the issue is that vaccines are a case in which our choices with our bodies/children do have the potential to infringe on the rights of others who are pro-vaccination.  Some vaccines are nearly 100% effective, others (eg the flu vaccine) are not.  If I get a measles vaccine it&#39;s not because the government made me it&#39;s because I don&#39;t want measles, so if I contract it from someone who did not vaccinate my rights to my body have been infringed because that person made the conscious decision not to reduce their potential of carrying and spreading the disease through vaccination.  I didn&#39;t.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ryan Harper has a very unique background and one perfectly suited to a project like the FunVax documentary. He graduated from UC Berkeley with a degree in Molecular Biology. He worked in a lab at UCSF and then became the director of the Biotechnology program at Silicon Valley College. He has been making films since 2005 and currently is the Executive Director of Salty Dog Studios, which produces feature films, documentaries, TV commercials and corporate videos. If it wasn&#39;t for his experience in both science and filmmaking Ryan Harper would have never been able to make this film and the truth about FunVax could have stayed hidden forever.</p>

<p>The guy who made the documentary has the exact skills required to make up something on this subject and have it sound plausible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is, not vaccinating not only harms your child, it harms the people around them as well. </p>

<p>Some people cannot be vaccinated due to medical conditions. Vaccines are also not 100% affective. If someone chooses not to vaccinate their kids, it is reasonable for me to not want them to be around my kid who cannot be vaccinated (theoretically. I don&#39;t have kids)  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My friends baby recently went in for his 4 month shots and had some of the vaccine pamphlets  on her counter.  Surprisingly, the  pamphlet said for her to avoid exposing her recently vaccinated baby to immunocompromised persons for several days as there is a chance that the baby could spread disease because of the vaccine. </p>

<p>Furthermore, I am not a fan of this argument (people mist be vaccinated because others can&#39;t) because it should demand that anyone with a cold or flu (or suspected of a cold or flu) should avoid ever going out in public due to the chance he/she could spread the illness to someone with a weak immune system. Its wrong to force vaccines on someone (and assume the risks that come with them) to spare someone else of risks. The government should not be deciding those things for us, in my opinion.</p>

<p>There have been documented instances where vaccinated populations still become infected with what they were vaccinated against. <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1202865">http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1202865</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that some sort of middle ground could be reached where vaccine use is prevalent and expected, but does not cross the line into being mandatory (to avoid setting the precedent that making medication mandatory is acceptable). Maybe it could be like owning a cell phone: I know they&#39;re tracking everything I do on that phone, and every location I go to, but I could easily just throw the phone away. People expect me to have one, but I could live life perfectly fine without it. In such a scenario, 99% of people would be vaccinated by choice but you could freely opt-out with no consequences. This would make it more difficult for the govt. to push more questionable or dangerous substances. Any public health problems that arise from unvaccinated people would just have to be accepted as the cost.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, that article was talking about how vaccinations are not 100% effective, and talks about the possibility that vaccines are not as quite as effective over the long term as initially thought. No where in that article does it back up your point that the vaccinations harm people. In fact, the examples given actually strengthen the argument for all people being vaccinated, as strong herd immunity can help to prevent the spread of diseases to individuals whose anti-bodies may still not be able to fight off the disease despite being vaccinated. </p>

<p>In essence, your own link argued against you. So, in a way, it is a story that is never told,but only because it is wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How is that quite the claim?  How do you think the human immune system is designed?  Without even opening those links i can tell you if they mention measles and mumps they don&#39;t mention the fact that the MMR2 vaccine is no where close to the 90% effective rate they claim it is (there&#39;s a lawsuit ongoing against Merck right now). And most people don&#39;t even know they&#39;re no longer immune and don&#39;t get booster shots.</p>

It is an opinion piece written by a neurosurgeon (out of his discipline) expressing ideas that fly in the face of all of the scientific data available. </p>

<p>So, let&#39;s try this one more time. Can you provide me with scientific sources challenging the widely accepted concept of herd immunity related to vaccines? Do you actually have any?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you provide some sources justifying your description of herd immunity as a fairy tale? As far as I know the science surrounding the importance of herd immunity is pretty solid. Here are some examples:</p>

<p>Rather than continue copy and pasting links all day, I&#39;ll just provide you with <a href="https://scholar.google.ca/scholar?start=0&amp;amp;q=herd+immunity+vaccines&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;as_sdt=0,5&amp;amp;as_vis=1">this</a> links to a basic google scholar search for the topic. I haven&#39;t found any so far that invalidates the results and ideas purveyed by all these articles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your links are bunk junk based on ideologies and false premises.  No doubt they are circulated because they advocate more vaccines ($$$).</p>

<p>Example: second link:</p>

<p>Conclusion: With such vaccines on the horizon, the requirements for vaccine delivery need to be considered, particularly who should be vaccinated and at what age.</p>

<p>Secondly, any studies I do post you will simply attack me or the author and I&#39;m on a mobile, it&#39;s Sunday and I&#39;m not interested.  I have some good friends that participate in this industry and they know the game.  They are only allowed to publish studies congruent to the agenda; offering up a study which is counter is career suicide.  Good day.</p>

<p>Oh, look at you, discounting the work of scientists with no actual critique of their methods or conclusions! Why don&#39;t you go ahead and provide some critique of their papers instead of vague, slanderous attacks. You need to address the content and counter it, preferably backing your arguments with their own sources.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Secondly, any studies I do post you will simply attack me or the author</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You literally just did that. I will address the content of the paper, just like I asked you to. I asked for proof because you said that an important scientific concept is a &quot;fairy tale&quot; with no justification. If your evidence is strong, I will adopt your position. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m on a mobile, it&#39;s Sunday and I&#39;m not interested</p>

<p>Don&#39;t call concepts fairy tales and the work of scientists &quot;junk&quot; if you aren&#39;t gunna bother backing your shit up. I can wait until tomorrow or whenever you get a chance. You should be able to support your words, to try to avoid this would be cowardly.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Ooh, look, an anecdoctal story with no supporting evidence provided!</p>
