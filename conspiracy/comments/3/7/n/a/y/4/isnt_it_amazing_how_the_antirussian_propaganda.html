<p>.............</p>

<p>All three of these posts are currently in the first 7 spots, on the front page of r/worldnews. </p>

<p>So 3 out of 7 top viral posts are about the &quot;evil&quot; Russians, after many weeks of barely any news about them (which I was pretty shocked about considering we have been bombarded since before Sochi started).</p>

<p>Its like someone turned on a faucet.</p>

<p>You better believe there is a reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is <a href="http://zetatalk.com/ning/21mr2015.htm"><strong>ZetaTalk</strong></a> on the russophobia that took place during Putin&#39;s temporary absence 2 months ago. (<em>it is related to the announcement on Nibiru &amp; other interests who&#39;re eyeing Russian gas&amp; oil fields</em>):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What do misdirected communications between Houston and the UK&#39;s Atomic Weapons Establishment and Royal Mail on March 8, NATO war games in Norway on March 10, Fox news hosting a retired US General on March 10 who asserted that Russians should be send home in body bags from the Ukraine, Putin canceling engagements on March 11 and going missing, the Kremlin hinting on March 13 that Putin would make a major announcement on March 16, and a sudden Russian military exercise in the Arctic near Norway on March 15 have to do with one another? <strong>Putin emerged for his March 16 presser with the President of Kyrgyzstan, as scheduled, but there was no special announcement.</strong>  </p>

<p>The key here are the encrypted communications from Houston to the UK, which the <a href="http://research.dyn.com/2015/03/uk-traffic-diverted-ukraine/">Ukraine hijacked</a>. The Ukraine did not intend for this to be discovered, but rather intended to alter the messages to instruct the UK to launch nuclear missiles at Russia. Russia was expected to react, and then NATO was expected to muster forth to defend NATO countries. Combined with the NATO exercises in Norway, a war with Russia, just what Kiev wants, would be in process before it could be stopped, or so it was hoped. This was not lost on the Council of Worlds, who stepped in to ensure no messaging was altered but rather that the hijacking was discovered.</p>

<p><strong>Kiev’s backers are desperate to push into the Russian oil and gas fields just to the east of the Ukraine, just as Netanyahu is desperate to commandeer the US military for his hopes for war against Iran in the Middle East. But neither will win. Was there more to this game than Kiev’s ambitions? The latest plan to commandeer the UK’s nuclear weapons was intended to stop the announcement from beginning, as Putin was on the verge. There was side action, attempts at the last minute to assassinate Putin, thus he and his main bodyguard were absent for days. It should be noted that pronouncements on Putin’s death or a coup came from Ukraine and Israeli sources.</strong></p>

<p>Will any of this be explained, or in the news? The public will not be informed, but as in the past when <a href="http://zetatalk.com/newsletr/issue391.htm">Bait and Switch</a> were played <a href="http://zetatalk.com/ning/22mr2014.htm">to flush out</a> cover-up proponents, the cleanup from this will be ongoing. Many, such as the Retired General Scales on Fox News, revealed their alliances. Putin did not reappear until these investigations were well underway, and the guilty in hand. Who is colluding or associating with the guilty is noted and traced. Black ops are countered by black ops, who operate without trial or jury and eliminate the guilty quietly. </p>

<p>(This is the <a href="http://poleshift.ning.com/profiles/blogs/nasa-exploding-launch-the-council-of-worlds-at-war-over-the-annou">behind-the-scenes war in getting an announcement on Nibiru</a> out. Per the zetas, Russia, China &amp; Obama want to get the announcement out. But elements within the establishment including the <strong>banking industry, Israel &amp; the media are blocking this from happening</strong>. This is why we have seen the spate of banks accepting guilt &amp; fines so as to prevent further investigations. This is why Netanyahu has been poking Obama in the eyes lately &amp; this is why we have seen media personalities like Brian Williams, Stephanopoulos &amp; O&#39;Reilly getting bad press. The media personalities are only pawns &amp; not the main targets. Much of the war happens behind the scenes, according to ZetaTalk)</p>

<p>Try posting all of the shady things the U.S. does and see how quickly it&#39;s down voted or removed (if popular). Now if it&#39;s putting Russia in a negative light, you can be sure it&#39;ll be voted to the top and gilded. </p>
