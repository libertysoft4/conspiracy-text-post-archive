Also, what about the suicide bombers that exploded outside the stadium? Anyone have footage of that or photographs of where the bombs went off?

    <div class="md"><p>Anyone can fake evidence, but how do you fake a void of evidence? Like in all cases, just looking for as much information as possible. You essentially deem it likely that of all 100+ varying personalities, ethnicities, and cultural backgrounds, no one would deem documenting this worth dying for (in a situation they were likely to die anyway)?</p>

<p>not even trying to argue, i just want to better understand your thought about the lack of general evidence involving cases like this. it never turns up, we never see it. why?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well i dont know about evidences persay, im no policer officer, im not working on the investigation. What i told is just facts, from the few amateur clips of bystanders and most basic informations relayed by the french media. </p>

<p>On a phone video clip taken outside of the Bataclan, you can hear lots of gunfire, three distinct explosions, and a flash happening later on on the second floor, which is what i assume would be the police intervention that neutralized the fourth &#39;attacker&#39;.
What happened at the Stade de France was broadcasted live on national television, same thing, three distinct and rather loud explosions.
What happened in the street is i admit a bit more fuzzy at this point, as you can imagine no bystander dared even step closer to the massacre while they were hearing heavy gunfire.
Also, one thing we get to see and you probably dont is the testimony on tv of the people that were actually there and survived. I can just relate to what they say, and its painfull to hear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, I feel terrible that this happened - I know real people died, I have friends and relatives in Paris, THIS is exactly why I want to know what happened in there, what really happened. The lack of any exposure of the events that went down in the theatre in the news is exactly why everyone should be wondering what the fuck happened.
Refer back to the Nord Ost event in Moscow. Same setting, same situation, lots of coverage. Don&#39;t you think we deserve to know how and why innocent people died at this theatre? Instead of just believing passports were found. There&#39;s so much sketchiness surrounding the events of last night - and so much failure by the media to provide us with any accurate information what so ever. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do deserve to know why those people died in the theatre, but i do not think seeing how they were all shot to death like fish in a barrel could in any way or form help figure out the reasons.
What happened is four terrorist burst in the theater all guns blazing shooting people, lets end it at that.
Any video that might show the terrorist just even shoot their AKs is just more salt on a large wound that is still bleeding out, it hurts really bad</p>
