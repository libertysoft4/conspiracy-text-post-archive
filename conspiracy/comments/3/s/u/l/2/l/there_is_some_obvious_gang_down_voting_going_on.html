    <div class="md"><p>Yep. There were four attacks this week and a lot of casualties. Hopefully it&#39;s not the start of a bigger threat. The first thing MSNBC discussed after the attacks was how New York should be on alert. France was (still is?) in martial law to find possible other shooters. That could happen in other countries as well. The US did it in Boston. Yes it&#39;s fear mongering, but the world feels vulnerable and they&#39;re prepping people to allow it in the name of safety. </p>

<p>There are no crisis actors involved in this, no smoke and mirrors, no trickery. It was a real attack and people died.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, there is no doubt that it was a real attack, and there is no doubt that those who perpetrated the attacks with guns and suicide bombings were genuine Muslim Jihadist fanatics who were committed to killing and dying for &quot;the cause&quot;.</p>

<p>The question is, who planned and orchestrated the attacks, and armed and equipped these terrorists? Did these fanatic terrorists know who they were working for?</p>

<p>Why is this a valid question?</p>

<p>Guardian, UK:</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/21/government-agents-directly-involved-us-terror-plots-report">Government agents &#39;directly involved&#39; in most high-profile US terror plots</a></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nearly all of the highest-profile domestic terrorism plots in the United States since 9/11 featured the &quot;direct involvement&quot; of government agents or informants, a new report says.</p>

<p>Some of the controversial &quot;sting&quot; operations <strong>&quot;were proposed or led by informants&quot;</strong>, bordering on entrapment by law enforcement. Yet the courtroom obstacles to proving entrapment are significant, one of the reasons the stings persist. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>[...]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In some cases the FBI may have created terrorists out of law-abiding individuals by suggesting the idea of taking terrorist action or encouraging the target to act,&quot; the report alleges.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[...]</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>The four high-profile domestic plots it found FREE of government involvement</strong> were the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing; Najibullah Zazi&#39;s 2009 plot to bomb the New York subway; the attempted Times Square carbombing of 2010; and the 2002 shooting at Los Angeles International Airport&#39;s El Al counter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The FBI uses &quot;informants&quot; (usually other Muslims that they have by the balls) to seek out and recruit gullible losers with a fanatic bent, and cons them into helping to &quot;plan&quot; acts of terror. The clowns that they hook are usually broke loners of limited mental capacity, and so the &quot;informants&quot; and their handlers usually have to do all of the planning, find them the &quot;weapons&quot; (usually fakes) that they&#39;ll use, and often even supplies them with phones, transportation, and even pays the fucking rent. They run the scam all the way to the point of &quot;completion&quot;, and then turn around and &quot;bust&quot; these &quot;terrorists&quot;, making high-profile announcements of <strong>Another Terror Plot Foiled by FBI</strong>.</p>

<p>The point is that these suckers believed <strong>all along</strong> that they were working with genuine &quot;Brothers&quot;, and that they were going to &quot;strike the infidels for Allah&quot;. </p>

<p>So, what would prevent some other &quot;special interest&quot; group from using the FBI&#39;s playbook - recruiting gullible fanatics, supplying them with REAL weapons, sending them to targets, and setting them loose to commit murder and mayhem?</p>

<p>While there is no doubt that the attacks were real, and the attackers sincere (willing to die for &quot;the cause&quot;, <strong>the people who planned and organized the Paris attacks and provided the weapons</strong> need not have been any more genuine Jihadists than the FBI informants and handlers that duped the idiots here in the states.</p>

<p>When something like this happens, we naturally ASSUME that the attacks were carried out by Muslim fanatics - but we should consider that there may be OTHER &quot;interested  parties&quot; who might benefit from the ensuing chaos, the emotional outrage, and the REACTIONS by both governmental and private parties that will most surely follow.</p>

<p>As always, the first and most important question we need to ask is <strong>WHO BENEFITS?</strong> </p>

<p>ISIS? Sure, they&#39;ll be partying hearty as the bombs and missiles rain down on their heads from French, British, US, and Russian forces. SUCCESS!!! ???</p>

<p>Realistically, what advantage would they hope to gain by pulling off an act like this?</p>

<p>We need to take a step back and recall that things are not always as they seem. There are other parties and motives that must be considered.</p>

<p>Read this: </p>

<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavon_Affair">Lavon Affair</a></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Lavon Affair refers to a failed Israeli covert operation, code named Operation Susannah, conducted in Egypt in the Summer of 1954. As part of the false flag operation,[1] a group of Egyptian Jews were recruited by Israeli military intelligence to plant bombs inside Egyptian, American and British-owned civilian targets, cinemas, libraries and American educational centers. The bombs were timed to detonate several hours after closing time. The attacks were to be blamed on the Muslim Brotherhood, Egyptian Communists, &quot;unspecified malcontents&quot; or &quot;local nationalists&quot; with the aim of creating a climate of sufficient violence and instability to induce the British government to retain its occupying troops in Egypt&#39;s Suez Canal zone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More at the link - and there are many other examples where false-flag strategies have been employed.</p>

<p>If a false-flag is SUCCESSFUL, you&#39;ll never know that it WAS a false-flag. The only ones we know with certainty to be false-flags are those that FAIL.</p>

<p>To assume that EVERYTHING is a false flag would be silly - but failing to consider the <strong>possibility</strong> that unseen third-party actors may be involved would be negligent and irresponsible.</p>

<p>as much as  I don&#39;t want to come of as a whiny baby but yes I&#39;ve noticed it too. VERY little take off from r/conspiracy/new beyond single digit net votes.  I had several posts in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> hours ago, and they never made it past 2 net upvotes. What I found very suspicious was that I was refreshing my posts every few minutes and I could see the total votes fluctuate between 12 - 14 votes and the net votes would be 0, 1 and 2. I am guessing my posts were being maintained at 0-2 votes to minimize visibility. I literally watched </p>

<p><strong>12 votes</strong> at <strong>net=0</strong> one minute, then</p>

<p><strong>13 votes* at **net=1</strong>, then later</p>

<p><strong>12 votes</strong> at <strong>net=0</strong>, then </p>

<p><strong>14 votes</strong> at <strong>net=2</strong>, and so on and so forth. </p>

<p>I accept that my posts might be of poor quality but there is no way total votes could remain within 12-14 bound if the net votes kept changing consistently, without some sort of vote manipulation unless it&#39;s a unknown <strong>purely technical</strong> reddit mechanism which I am not aware of. Also someone is shadowbanned in this thread, <strong>before I submit this</strong> there are <strong><em>6 comments</em></strong> but only 5 of you guys are shown</p>
