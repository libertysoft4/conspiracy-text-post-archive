I think this could be a method to show the definitive truth. One of the experiments flat Eathers look to is an experiment done in a canal that shows no curvature. But I suspect this may lead to inaccuracies because water may react differently when filling areas on flat land compared to a large ocean. My idea is to do somekind of test along the beaches of the ocean. The water should follow the curve of the Earth at the ocean shores. So you could build some type of small towers at this point and then go down shore and build another tower and try to measue the curvature there using lasers or a particle acclerator beam or even long cables stretched between towers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the water doesn&#39;t seem to follow the curve of the earth on canals, why should it follow the curve of the earth on ocean shores?  Perhaps the true way to test this is by looking towards the horizon of the massive oceans (which, by either gravity ... or upwards acceleration, whatever you believe, should either be precisely flat or precisely wrap around the earth.)  Are their claims of perspective being the reason things disappear have some truth to it?  Does a telescope truly &quot;recover&quot; the sight of a ship that sunk past the horizon?  </p>

<p>This seems to be the easiest of tests if you really wanted to know the answer (and one must perform it himself since there is no real reason to believe scientific or internet-found claims without a doubt .  To measure the flatness or rotundity using your proposed method will likely result in unmanageable sources of error/deviation from the actual value.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s something called light refraction though.. this is why scientists claim that things look higher at the horizon than they should. But flat Earthers don&#39;t buy this claim.</p>

<p>The reason I think it doesn&#39;t follow with canals is because the localized gravity on land may prevent the curvature from taking effect. I think land filling valleys on Earth when geological formations were created may be totally flat for the same reason. And that flat Earth between mountains would cause the water to follow the same shape. The same with lakes too.</p>

<p>I think the curvature would follow on ocean shores because the water would follow the contour of the oceans more rather than the localized gravity on land. There are gravity maps that show gravity is stronger at different places on Eath. The shores may be affected a bit but I suspect not as much as on land due to the formations I talked about previously.</p>

<p>Can you explain that a little more?  Are you suggesting this as a solution to why a telescope might make an object that disappeared over the horizon, appear again (assuming that its true, which I find hard to believe but haven&#39;t done the experiment myself)</p>

<p>Edit: Refraction would only be introduced if the local density above the water changes as one measures out towards the deep ocean/horizon.  This is certianly plausible, since perhaps it generally gets colder out towards the ocean, causing light to bend downwards as it passes through the gradient of increasing index of refraction.  But then why did the ship disappear in the first place?  Too small to see?</p>

<p>As for local gravity and geological formation: It follows that the more flat a particular region is, the more curved it most be in another area.  You can imagine this as we live on something less discrete than this random image of a 3d shape (<a href="http://www.pigsbladderfootball.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Screen-Shot-2012-07-01-at-23.30.50.png">http://www.pigsbladderfootball.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Screen-Shot-2012-07-01-at-23.30.50.png</a>) </p>

<p>I think your point may be that flat earthers are focusing on measurements taken on the flat surfaces?   But then we should be able to pinpoint areas of largely increased curvature to make up for the flat areas.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. It&#39;s the same kind of thing that causes mirages on deserts. Water in dense atmosphere causes refraction of light - just like how light refracts through glass for the same reason. Scientists claim this is why the curvature of the Earth isn&#39;t as noticeable as it should be and why you can see objects you shouldn&#39;t if the Earth is curved.</p>

<p>Since I believe you can&#39;t see the curvature as easily on land or water on land then that leaves the ocean. But getting accurate measurements on an unstable ocean surface is problematic. This is why I think the ocean shore is the best place to do a test like this. You would have an unimpeded line of site on the shore as well because people don&#39;t build on it or you could measure from 2 different outcrops or &quot;points&quot; downshore.</p>

<p>Refractions might be why a laser might not work.. but maybe if you use a high power laser pulse you could get around this problem.. or a particle accelerator. Or long cables you could measure in various ways.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This still didn&#39;t answer my question.  I completely comprehend why refraction might make curvature less detectable.  But then we&#39;d be able to reverse this affect by looking from the deep ocean towards the shore (supposing the temperature increases in that direction and the index of refraction decreases.)  Objects should disappear over the horizon faster.  (Closer to the measurer)</p>

<p>Regardless this still doesn&#39;t get to the idea that objects might very well reappear if looking through a telescope.  As mentioned in my first post, I am most curious in substantiating this claim that I&#39;ve read in numerous places.  Perhaps its blatantly false.  But let&#39;s suppose the phenomenon happened.  Do you believe it can be explained by light refractions?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep.  That&#39;s the unsubstantiated, confusing claim I&#39;ve read in a couple of places.  But it would have great ramifications if true.  And I don&#39;t believe it can be explained using refraction.  But also, my first paragraph shows that the earth would appear more curved depending on which you are measuring.  Also if in the very deep ocean, I don&#39;t believe refraction would be part of the equation at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My understanding is that the object doesn&#39;t reappear... not sure how you interpret reappear. My view is that it&#39;s made visible through the telescope. The reason for this is perspective. The object is just too small when not magnified to be able to see it properly. The refraction is always there.</p>

<p>Also.. I get the impression you are saying that temperature is an issue with refraction and that&#39;s why it shouldn&#39;t work towards shore? I think temperature is just a small part of it but the refraction is always there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Refraction can&#39;t just always be there.  You&#39;d have to at least suggest why it&#39;d always be there.  If there are no local deviations in some physical property of the air above the surface of the ocean,  then I&#39;d see no reason why it&#39;d be there unless we begin discussing the potential electromagnetic field effects inherent in our earth-atmosphere system.  </p>

<p>I feel like the argument that refraction is &quot;always there&quot; stems from scientific explanation of one aspect of sunsets.  In this case, I&#39;d agree refraction is always there, since light is traveling through greatly differing densities/temperatures of the atmosphere at steep angles.  </p>

<p>And for clarification, yes, i meant disappear/reappear in the sense that our biological eyesight had insignificant magnification to identify some far away object still in line of sight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, that&#39;s the claim.. anywhere in the atmosphere there is refraction. The denser the atmosphere the more refraction. In space this isn&#39;t the case because there is no atmosphere. But our view of space is not accurate because of the atmosphere. I mean I am not saying there isn&#39;t a possibility that this is wrong a lie. But according to their claims it is consistent.</p>

<p>Regarding this comment.. imagine you blew that geometric shape up dramatically.. I imagine the land areas on the Earth&#39;s surface being a more detailed version - many more connecting rods and geometric surfaces. And the connecting rods would be mountain ranges. The inner wells would be like concave troughs. Or flat spots or troughs with flat spots in the center. And shallow water would follow this gravity shape as well.</p>

<p>When the link above was clicked, it brought me to this discussion.  Thanks to you and your friends disruption efforts, the topic is now listed as being heavily shilled.  I read down through the comments, and sure enough exactly as expected, you&#39;re playing the exact same role with flat earf here that you ALWAYS do.  Rockran right into this thread to tell everyone how wrong they are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you want to use light you have to consider whether or not light bends in the atmosphere.  In fact it does bend in the atmosphere, but not in the way you might think.  In order for you to be able to see objects over water at the distances they are visible with a spherical earth of circumference 25000 miles light needs to bend by an amount nearly equal to this curvature.  But, if you test how light bends with a device such a theodolite you find that it in fact bends the other way, up through the atmosphere!  Read about that here: <a href="http://www.wildheretic.com/bendy-light-the-evidence/">http://www.wildheretic.com/bendy-light-the-evidence/</a> in the &quot;Theodolites&quot; section.</p>

<p>The idea you propose sounds a lot like an experiment that was performed with a mechanical device on a beach called the rectilineator experiment.  It showed that the earth curves up, rather than down.  Description of that here:  <a href="http://www.wildheretic.com/concave-earth-theory/6/">http://www.wildheretic.com/concave-earth-theory/6/</a>  or youtube description of the experiment here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IinxfgwR0w">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IinxfgwR0w</a></p>

<p>Much of the evidence in the area of Flat Earth is not actually proof of a flat earth, but proof against the spinning globe.  I think that the spinning globe model is wrong, but I think the evidence for the Concave Earth model is stronger than that for Flat Earth.  Flat Earth suffers for the &quot;Southern Problem&quot;.  How do the sun and stars work for the far South?  For example to have a long, 17 hour, summer day at the tip of Argentina with a flat earth and sun rotating around the North pole, the visible sun distance of the sun must be huge.  This does not completely rule out a flat earth since there are possible models involving dome reflection to make the sun and stars work, but it cannot work as a spotlight.</p>

<p>The Concave model is much more complete and the empirical evidence is fairly strong.  I think it is possible that flat earth is an obfuscation, offering a false choice between the official model and the standard flat model.  It is an interesting subject, that is for sure.  People who do nothing but shout it down are missing something I think, there are too many problems with the official model.  A large problem is the size of the lie, it is just beyond consideration for most people.</p>

<p>I think it is odd that the moon is set up in such a way that we only ever see one side of it.  I am fairly certain that we have never landed on it.

<p>Though I am not a flat earth advocate per say, I have come to believe there is more to the story than we have all
 been taught. Nothing can prove heliocentricity, and the proof we have of earth being a ball is not all that convincing once you realise all those nasa pictures are fake composite images.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.. the Bedford level experiment is not accurate in my view because it is on land which could cause inaccuracies due to variations in the gravity  effects on land. I don&#39;t think this would be an issue or as big an issue on ocean shores which is why I think tests should be done there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That experiment is so flawed it does not have to go into alot of processing and serious thought...It was done by a man in the 1800s and he only measured a length of a canal that was 6 miles long....</p>

<p>6 MILES...not 60 not 600 not 6000 but 6..and said there was no curvature.?.</p>

<p>THink about it..the earth is some 24,000 miles wide right? something like that..if the earth curved at 600 miles ,even then the world would be the size of a little bigger than mercury..and at 6 miles your talking about a moon and not a planet at all..
Plus it goes to show that some will go as far to say the earth is flat because of NASA&#39;s lies...
.Do i believe NASA lies? of course, all the time especially when they say they can spot a planet a million light years away and tell us it has water on it and that it has oxygen and yet they never show you a real picture of the planet but an &quot;artist rendition&quot; aka cough cough MADE UP..And yet also they just now are showing real pictures of Pluto for the first time...
So a planet thats millions of miles away is now being seen for the first time yet they are jerking us off by saying that they can tell that a shiny bright light thats billions of miles even millions of light years away has anything on it? and at that saying it exists when they ALSO say that everything we see is most likely not there because the light is actually just arriving to us from its vast travels through space..</p>

<p>So again does NASA LIE. no doubt about it..But is the earth flat?
NOT LIKELY.. Since it is a fact if it was, i should be able to see Tokyo from California and Paris from New York but i dont.</p>

Could it be concave somehow and that is why it has craters in perspective? I&#39;m not sure.. but it&#39;s also possible that the moon could be shaped differently than the Earth..
