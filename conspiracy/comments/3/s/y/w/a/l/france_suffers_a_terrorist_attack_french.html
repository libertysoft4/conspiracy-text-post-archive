        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">109</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2015-11-16 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/magnora7.html">magnora7</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>About the French bombing Syria today if you haven&#39;t heard about it: <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/11/france-isil-raqqa-g20-151115211105532.html">http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/11/france-isil-raqqa-g20-151115211105532.html</a> </p>

<p>It&#39;s a similar pattern to 9/11 and the Iraq war. </p>

<p>US suffers terrorist attack -&gt; US Nationalism (read: government support) spikes to all-time highs -&gt; US Invades Iraq (who obviously had nothing to do with it, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RC1Mepk_Sw">they just wanted to take over Iraq</a>) and kills over half a million people and gave the military industrial complex $1.7 Trillion dollars. </p>

<p>Problem -&gt; reaction -&gt; solution. Create or wait for a problem, use the media to control the public&#39;s reaction, then use that reaction (typically fear) to sell a solution. Profit from the sales. </p>

<p>They want a war because most western governments are owned in large part the military-industrial complex, and they are taking advantage of a crisis to use the nationalistic support to provide a moral cover to justify military action in other countries. People are afraid to say anything against action in Syria because it makes them look like they&#39;re anti-french government, and with all the flags going around it feels rather uncomfortable to do. </p>

<p>TSA scanners, Iraq war, France&#39;s bombing in Syria, and literally thousands of other events throughout history follow this pattern. Profiting from fear, profiting from making people afraid to speak out. The public needs to wake up to how we&#39;re being emotionally manipulated to justify wars for profit. </p>

<p>The media isn&#39;t going to talk about it though, so it&#39;s up to us regular people to spread the word which is why I wrote this post. Feel free to copy any material here to post to other forums if you don&#39;t wish to write one yourself. Talk to people you know about this. Spread the word, take a part in waking people up instead of just sitting by the sidelines. If/when things eventually go bad, don&#39;t you at least want to say you tried your best to help the situation? Our lack of objection is their permission slip. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, but they kicked it up a notch. I read they dropped 40 bombs today on Raqqa.</p>

<p>Although considering the whole deal about the US &quot;bombing&quot; ISIS but actually bombing empty fields... I have to wonder if France is doing the same. </p>

<p>This whole thing is so squirrely. All I can put together is that this is a huge payday for the Military Industrial complex that in part runs so many of the western governments. War means money for them, so they continually stir up situations that would result in conflict, for profit. To sell missiles and fighter jets and so on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve tried gently asking people to take some time to emotionally process this event before demanding military action. The last time we offered kneejerk support for war, we got the PATRIOT Act and two military quagmires that are still ongoing. </p>

<p>Pointing this out, of course, went over like a lead balloon.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t seen this much blind support for war since the early years of the Bush Administration. It&#39;s frightening. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it&#39;s possible for sure but think about when it was published, 1932.  It&#39;s kind of a stretch to know it would play out like this based on some master plan.  </p>

<p>And to be fair, the book isn&#39;t a perfect alignment with today&#39;s society at all.  There are similarities but there are also a lot of difference.</p>

<p>To illustrate - think about what will happen almost 100 years in the future and start being more and more specific.  Then imagine all of the ways it can go off the rails and adjust your story.  How accurate do you really think it&#39;ll be - even if there is some master plan.  </p>

<p>Technology is a HUGLY disruptive influence and it&#39;s changed considerably in the last 40,50 60 years....something even Freemasons couldn&#39;t predict.</p>

<p>Yes they say, people support us and yet I don&#39;t know a single person who would say, yes, let&#39;s spend 100 billion dollars now on war, not even 10 years after 9/11 and in the middle of the worst economic crisis in the past 100 years when people have less and less food, jobs and clothes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see, more nationalism is less resistance. I think you should be careful assigning this nationalism to the right or the left though, because both have been guilty of authoritarianism throughout history. Authoritarians will use any ideology to gain power, left or right. Whatever works. </p>

<p>The real divide is the authoritarians vs the anti-authoritarians not the left vs the right. Media doesn&#39;t shut up about left vs right because it serves to divide up the anti-authoritarians in to two camps, which keeps them from uniting to overthrow the authoritarians. Divide and conquer. </p>
