    <div class="md"><p>WW3 will last a few days if that, and end when the world is radioactive ash. The M.A.D. policy is still very much in effect, the end of the cold war did not end Mutually Assured Destruction.  But lets say there is a conventional warfront somewhere.  Yes I will fight for my country.  Combat soldiers often talk about fighting for their country, but when they say that they almost always preface it by saying they fight for their way of life, their home, their family and friends.  Not necessarily their government. I&#39;d like to believe that would be what I was fighting for rather than for the government. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only way I&#39;d fight is if the country were actually invaded. </p>

<p>You asked the following:</p>

<p><em>Does the United States of America still stand for what we were taught in school and told on TV?</em></p>

<p>It depends on what you were taught in school and told on tv.</p>

<p><em>Does the United States of America really care about the citizens of this once great nation?</em></p>

<p>It never did and it was never a great nation. </p>

<p><em>Are you willing to still fight for our nation if, god forbid, there is a third world war? The answer (for me) is becoming harder and harder to answer.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Violence is not the answer. The &quot;country&quot; you and I live in is and has always been an experiment; just like all governments, isms, and institutions. I would only harm another being if that being was, within my sight, harming someone else. Countries mean nothing. Laws mean nothing. It is the people behind them who matter, who enact them, who worship them. There will not be a &quot;world war III&quot; because we have been in that state of constant war for decades. It&#39;s been World War III your whole life. World War III is being fought between the State and the People. The people of the world can stand united and go with the flow of nature or we can give in to the sensual pleasures of technology; which have sculpted us into gender-less automatons ready to work for $7 an hour for the rest of our lives. We must stop violence EVERYWHERE. We must stop racism EVERYWHERE. We must stop corporate irresponsibility EVERYWHERE. We must stop poverty EVERYWHERE. Countries should open their borders, people should work together, everyone should have their basic physical, mental, and emotional needs met... We can do it.  We just aren&#39;t. We have all this wonderful, God-like technology but we can&#39;t even feed many of our people, not to mention hundreds of millions of malnourished human beings well within the public&#39;s ability of aiding? It is truly sickening, the scope of human suffering. </p>
