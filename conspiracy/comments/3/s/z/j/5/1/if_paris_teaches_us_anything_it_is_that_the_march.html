<p>We just chose <em>not</em> to because we&#39;re not doing what&#39;s necessary as a people, as a species, as a civilization to stop it.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t give me this &quot;it can&#39;t be stopped&quot; bullshit.</p>

<p>Face the reality that it is WE who are not stopping it as a people.  We&#39;re not stopping it because we&#39;re not willing to put aside the bullshit indoctrinated falsehoods and racism that have been brainwashed in us.</p>

<p>The reason the wars don&#39;t get stopped isn&#39;t because we can&#39;t stop them.  It&#39;s because we&#39;re not doing what&#39;s necessary as a people to stop them.</p>

For example, I have 400 facebook friends. How many of them are speaking up? None. Maybe 1 or 2 are sceptical, but they are in no position to do anything. Even my own sister who I have tried to &quot;wake up&quot; believes the official narrative. The voice of reason gets shouted down in the echo chamber of MSM we are surrounded by. This isn&#39;t a fight between David and Goliath. It is more like a fight between an ant and a thunder storm. I used to be like you, but I have given up the fight. I admire you&#39;re optimism, and wish you luck. I am the first person that wants to see you succeed. I still will help in my own capacity, and it is only beneficial to be reminded of the reality of the situation, if you were truly prepared and/or serious to do anything about it.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a complete fallacy.  We outnumber TPTB by millions. Billions probably.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>For example, I have 400 facebook friends. How many of them are speaking up? None. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are relying on a social media platform which has been proven to silence any dissent that goes against the grain.  I still use this platform myself, and have not had very many people like my posts, or comment on them, but when I saw them in person, they told me they saw them, and have looked into it and found what I was saying is true.  They clearly are afraid to speak out, which is fine, that&#39;s their right, but even when you think you aren&#39;t reaching people because of likes or comments, know the work you&#39;re putting in is not going un-noticed.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I feel sorry for you, honestly.  You (seem to be) informed, and &quot;awake&quot; but have given up.  Never give up, ever.  I will only give up when I&#39;m six feet under.  Do you have kids?  I do, and that&#39;s what has really made me that much determined to fight as hard as a can to ensure they have just a good of world and country as I have growing up.  There is no other option but to fight IMHO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As it stands currently, the numbers are definitely in their favour, held together firmly by a hierarchical system of control. For every ten of us that are &quot;awake&quot;, there are a thousand that either believe the official narrative, or will support authority than go against it, or are directly working for them and are rewarded monetarily and with access to resources that none of us have. Moreover, they are a few steps ahead of the game, they know what is about to go down as they have planned things before hand. We are only reacting after the fact.</p>

<p>I can absolutely respect this sentiment. In fact, if I did not have children that I brought into this world, I too may find this mentality comforting, and the easiest way to deal with the craziness.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>in the face of these acts, we are just bystanders.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No.  We <em>choose</em> to be bystanders.  We <em>choose</em> to not get involved.  I’m not saying that we don’t have what we think or feel are decent, valid reasons for not getting involved - “I don’t want to lose my job/house/wife/husband/kids/job”, etc - but, again, we <em>choose</em> to not step in, come together, stand up for the shit we see wrong in the world, and put a stop to it.  Even if it’s because we feel powerless, we are still CHOOSING to not do anything (or nearly enough) about it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The wealthy and powerful people have their way, one way or the other.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fucking.  <em>Bullshit</em>.  I’m <em>telling</em> you it’s US.  It’s because WE keep letting them have their way.  We keep LETTING them coerce us into thinking we’re better/worse/smarter/dumber than one another because we’re black/white/male/female/rich/poor, etc.</p>

<p>We’re not helping one another as a people because we’ve allowed ourselves to be convinced that we <em>shouldn’t</em> be helping each other…and, as a result, we continue letting these powers that convinced us to keep ruling over us.</p>

<p>Humanity is like a kid from an <em>extremely</em> broken home who has the <em>worst</em> fucking parents and who KNOWS he’s got a completely shit-filled life, but - being a young kid - kind of feels trapped and powerless and like there’s simply no other way or avenue for him/her to go…so they keep taking the beatings and the abuse that their horrible parent keeps doling out to them day after day…and do nothing about it…and the kid believes what their parent tells them…and that kid feels trapped and like they can’t do anything…like the life they live is the ONLY choice possible to them and there’s nothing they can do about it.</p>

<p>And yet it’s ALL bullshit…and then when you become an adult - a 30 or 40 year old…or, hell, even a 25 year old - you look back at that kid and you wonder how it was ever possible that he/she didn’t just stand the fuck up to that piece of shit parent and just <em>fight back</em>/did what was right.</p>

<p>That’s not to say that things would be easy, and that’s not to say that a lot of kids that have abusive parents and who <em>do</em> fight back and end up running away don’t end up just as if not more fucked up now that they stood up and actually did something - maybe now they’re on the streets and homeless and even worse off.  However, the point to this analogy is that I think most of us can look at a young kid getting abused and think “Just FUCK that piece of shit parent up, kid!  Fuck them!  They don’t deserve you and you’re not stuck or beholden to them!  Stop taking that abuse!”</p>

<p>Many of us can very well think this, and we very well may be justified in our frustration over the kid remaining in this type of shitty situation, but the fact of the matter is that we as a civilization are no different.  We are the equivalent of a young kid with an abusive parent where the kid feels like there’s no other recourse but to keep taking the shit he/she is taking, so we just sit here and keep taking what TPTB keep dolling out to us.</p>

<p>It’s fucking <em>very</em> frustrating…especially for those of us kids in this civilization that know we <em>don’t</em> have to keep taking this shit.</p>

<p>We are being fucked, and manipulated, and destroyed and coerced by an evil elite that is destroying us and keeping us from being what we definitely <em>can</em> be…and, ultimately, it seems that the biggest thing that is keeping us shackled down and that is keeping us from rising up and moving forward together…is OUR VERY OWN MIND, our very own hearts.  It is <em>WE</em> who are keeping us from breaking out of this shit.  It’s us…not them…because we overpower them.  We are stronger than them.  There are a <em>lot</em> more of us than them.  We just have to come together.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They reward the people who they have indoctrinated handsomely while the ones that question their authority are thrown to the ashes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Correct, sir.  Correct.  All of us down here, living in the ashes, however, should simply hold hands, come together as one, and rise up.</p>

<p>Stop being their foundation - their support system…because that’s what we are.  They live off of US.  We are the <em>host</em>.  They are the parasite.  If the host only knew how massive and big and strong it was, it could stop supporting the parasite and would be able to kill it with little problem.</p>

<p>I feel like death is better than allowing myself to be beholden to the war machine that is this civilization, and I would rather die objecting to the b.s. that is happening and <em>not</em> partake in it rather than be part of the system just for the sake of continuing to live on this pitiful <del>planet</del> civilization as it stands.</p>

<p>I’m not saying that I’m some sort of “eternal rebel” - cuz I’m not.  I’m a normal person that drives a car, buys groceries, pays rent, still has to pay for shit, etc, etc.  I know I’m still “in the system/matrix”.  However, I feel myself more and more - <em>every</em> moment - being more and more aware of just how much of a fucking farce this whole civilization is.</p>

<p>And it’s not like I’m <em>just</em> starting to “wake up” mind you.  I’ve felt this way almost my entire life it feels.  I’m just saying that I’m getting <em>more</em> fed up with the bullshit lies on this planet by the day is all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have to understand that it&#39;s both easy and hard to be free.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Much easier if we all do it together and support one another…More difficult when we are alone and by ourselves as we are, which is exactly how TPTB have taught us to look at the world - like we are alone and powerless and ONLY have any strength if we pay attention not to each other, but to <em>them</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Don&#39;t be so hard on yourself,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m being hard on myself, and hard on <em>us</em> as a species.  I’m being hard on myself because I belong to a species that is NOT FUCKING WAKING <em>UP</em>.  smh.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>humanity has proved time and time again it is on the march for its own destruction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah.  And it doesn’t have to be that way.  We don’t have to be this way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And even a messiah can only break the fall. He cannot stop it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The messiah is as much a she as a he - and she/he is inside each and every one of us…and she/he CAN break the fall if we all come together and help one another.</p>

<p>Thanks for the words.</p>

<p>No I didn’t.  Where did I say that?  <em>Heaven</em> on Earth?  What?</p>

<p>I just said we don’t have to be as manipulated as we are.  That’s a <em>far</em> thing from saying “heaven on Earth” - whatever tf that is/might be.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and it is actually really simple.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>…Man….Yeah.  Lots of misinterpretation there.  I’m not saying it’s “really simple” either.  Obviously it’s not “really simple” since we are SUPER far from having what I’m talking about.  If it were that simple, we would already have had it by now.  Don’t misunderstand:  It’s super simple ONCE we do what we <em>need</em> to do.  DOING what we need to do, however, is obviously <em>not</em> “super simple” for a lot of humans, unfortunately.  It’s pretty darn simple for <em>some</em> of us, but we don’t need “some” of us to do this in order for things to work out.  We need a LOT of us to do the right thing - not just “some”.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But while my mind paints such a glorious picture, all my senses remind me of the stark reality outside.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well…your mind shouldn’t have been painting any such glorious picture in the first place.  It takes <em>work</em> to do what I’m personally proposing - for many it would take a <em>lot</em> of work.  Some people would have to very much change the racist way they see the world if things are going to change.  That might not be easy for some (many) at all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Take comfort in knowing that this world is just a passing phase.</p>

<p>Oh I take a <em>shit</em> ton of comfort in knowing that I won’t be here for too much longer.  The sooner I’m out of here, the better.  I’m counting the days of this life like a <a href="https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat414/sites/onlinecourses.science.psu.edu.stat414/files/lesson46/1214820_painted_by_numbers___.jpg">prison convict counts the days left on his sentence</a>, brother.</p>

<p>I actually can’t wait to get my walking papers and gtfo.  Seriously.</p>

<p>You continue misinterpreting what I’ve posted if you think I’m doing anything <em>near</em> that.</p>

<p>Perhaps.  Perhaps.  This may very well be a prison planet.  However, I’m still all for working as best as you can while you’re <em>in</em> this prison, however.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What lies ahead is yet to be seen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That, or we’ve seen it many times - over and over again in life after life - and we just have to keep coming back until we finally graduate from this “grade” of existence on this planet and we finally can leave this prison hell hole without having to come back.</p>

<p>However, if we all put aside the bullshit racism, etc that they (tptb) indoctrinate into us and we all come together as one citizenry, then we would in fact have ALL the fucking say in this.</p>

<p>Understand that.</p>

<p><em>Get</em> that in your fucking head.</p>

<p>KNOW that.</p>

<p>EDIT:  And, by the way, I know I used strong language, but I <em>totally</em> don&#39;t mean any antagonism toward you per se, okay? so please don&#39;t take anything I said in that manner.  I just know that WE AS A PEOPLE can come together and fight this, and any <em>one</em> of us feeling that &quot;we have no say in this&quot; is EXACTLY what tptb want us to think.</p>

<p>TPTB <em>want</em> us to think we have no say or power.  It&#39;s like if you&#39;re a 5-10 year old kid and you have a big, old super pedophile uncle that is abusing you.  That motherfucker <em>wants</em> you to think you are a little, powerless nothing...so he can KEEP abusing you!</p>

<p>Put a bullet in his fucking head or say &quot;fuck you&quot; and tell everyone you can what he&#39;s doing.</p>

<p>It&#39;s, I know, a LOOOOT easier said than done when you&#39;re nothing but a little 10 year old and you&#39;re being overwhelmed by a fucking bully, right?</p>

<p>Well, right now, WE the people - the 99% - are that 10 year old child...and tptb are that pedophile abusing bully.</p>

<p>And just like a pedophile abusing bully, they fucking THRIVE on secrecy.  They THRIVE on our cooperation and willingness to go along with their evil and not stand up to it.  If we DON&#39;T go along with their evil en mass, and we <em>all</em> stand up against it...</p>

<p>then the fucking pedophile will STOP being a fucking pedophile.  The pedophile will <em>stop</em> continuing to abuse us.</p>

<p>But right now <em>that&#39;s</em> what&#39;s happening, bro.  We&#39;re being abused as a citizenry...and we&#39;re letting it happen...and many of us are too scared to stand up and do anything about it...and we&#39;re thinking &quot;I&#39;m pretty sure we have no say in this.&quot;</p>

<p>But some of us WANT to fight this fucking manipulation...because so many of us are getting raped and tortured and killed and destroyed at the hands of this horribly, abusive, fucking pedophile <a href="http://cdn.meme.am/instances2/500x/2912133.jpg">uncle</a>.</p>

<p>We as a people have EVERY fucking say in this.  We just need to know it, <em>own</em> it, and act on it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Although I will agree with you for the most part, I know for me I can‘t even identify if we have an enemy, who it is. i.e...</p>

<p>I come from a large eastern city in the US. I have moved to a western city, not rural but it has some pretty rural ‘burbs. I have rommates that are litterally like Opie from Mayberry.  They do not question ANYTHING the t.v tells them. Thankfully I won‘t live with them for much longer. </p>

<p>Now this is my point. They came from 50 miles outside of one of the  most developed cities in the western part of the US and I think they are pretty fucking dense. </p>

<p>Now take me, I read everything I can conspiracy, main stream, social media and I still can figure what is REALLY going on and WHO is REALLY behind it. I mean we can ACT like we know the real deal, but we are light years behind and in the dark.</p>

<p>So let‘s take all of us that are at least savvy enough to know that something stinks, I think we just know it stinks and we think we knw what it is, but, really, do we? Now that‘s us.</p>

<p>To the peolple in the less sophisticated and uneducated parts of this country, omfg. If we are light years behind, they are millions of light years behind. If we just barely see the tip of the iceberg they don‘t even know an iceberg exists. </p>

<p>So I don‘t think it‘s a matter of can we stop ‘it‘, I really do think, what is it that we are even looking to stop, and should it even be stopped?</p>

<p>Spot on. There is a US army residence near where I live and it is guarded by the most uneducated, illiterate Indians who have come here from villages to earn just a fraction more of what they have earned if they stayed back in their country. You cannot even begin to have a conversation with them about reality. They don&#39;t even have the right faculties for that. And even if they did, they would be like the rest of the people in the educated world. There are quite a few hurdles to jump if you were to really free the mind.

Some may get agitated at the movie, at fellow theatre goers, at the actors, or at the director himself, not realizing that we have been given essentially a free ticket to watch what is just a movie and that there isn&#39;t much long before we are kicked out of the theatre. So while you can, enjoy the show! Cheers!</p>

<p>What we are looking to stop is our ignorance and our inability to see one another as parts of the same whole.  The being “apart and antagonistic” part of this civilization that so constantly gets indoctrinated into us is, I feel, a pretty good specific that needs to get stopped.</p>

<p>I feel like I can personally see what I just mentioned above pretty clearly actually.  I feel pretty comfortable <em>right now</em> in moving forward this very moment and jumping head long into a willingness to help one another - help my fellow being (human and otherwise) - and engender an energy of connectives amongst <em>all</em> of us.  Right now, what we have in this civilization is, to a great extent, antagonism against one another - antagonism based on race, creed, religion, economic status, etc, etc…and all these things are ultimately flames that are fanned by TPTB.  <em>These</em> are the things that we can fight against and counter by simply NOT playing into them; NOT vying into the antagonistic type of thinking that gets indoctrinated into us from birth.  Easier said than done, I know, but if we all imbued and engendered the proper mentality of seeing one another independent of the b.s. antagonistic indoctrination we’re fed, we would be able to go a long ways AWAY from the very things TPTB use to pit us against one another and cause us to fight with one another in war after endless war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Spot on mate. We are just spectators watching fragments of a movie, we call life. Some may get agitated at the movie, at fellow theatre goers, at the actors, or at the director himself, not realizing that we have been given essentially a free ticket to watch what is just a movie and that there isn&#39;t much long before we are kicked out of the theatre. So while you can, enjoy the show! Cheers!</p>
