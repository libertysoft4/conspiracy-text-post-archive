I swear to God I hate this phenomenon that when the media or shills claims something is a big thing being discussed by everyone while in actuality it is not a big thing at all.

<p>Ok, so it&#39;s just the news outlets you follow and not the people you interact with?  If that&#39;s the case, then your use of the word &quot;everyone&quot; is confusing.</p>

<p>Um, ok.  If pointing out the fact that it&#39;s also somebody&#39;s own fault if they are willingly getting their information from places that are obsessed over this ridiculous topic, then I guess I&#39;m a jerk.  </p>

<p>The reason that certain media are going crazy over this topic is because of ratings, if people don&#39;t watch or care, they won&#39;t cover it.  It&#39;s pretty easy to change the channel, if the places you get your information make you think that &quot;everyone is obsessing&quot; over it, then you are actually actively contributing to the problem of the superficial media.</p>

I think I&#39;m in favor of the &quot;Prussian Blood ritual&quot;, &quot;MK ultra&quot; and the commentary about being distracted until our inevitable deaths. I&#39;ll keep all of those in mind as I scroll through the news next time. </p>
