    <div class="md"><p>Arguably Libya was the centre of al Qaeda long before Bin Laden became its figurehead. Gaddafi&#39;s Green Book and its followers are responsible for plenty of anti western hate including acts of terrorism. They intervened all around the world to oppose Americans or Capitalists in some way.</p>

<p>Yet Libya has had a strangely close relationship with both Britain and the US at times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The United Arab Emirates shipped weapons to its allies in Libya in violation of a UN resolution and with the apparent knowledge of the US government, according to leaked Emirati emails shared with the New York Times this week.</p>

<p>Last week, MEE published another email showing that Bernadino Leon, the UN envoy to Libya, was covertly working for the Gulf country to support one side in the war even while mediating between the two parties.</p>

<p>Libya is in the midst of a civil war to determine control of Africa’s largest oil reserves.
On one side, there is the Tripoli-based General National Congress (GNC), which is backed militarily by the Misratan-led Alliance of Libya Dawn, and is also said to receive support from Qatar and Turkey.</p>

<p>On the other, the House of Representatives (HoR) was elected in June last year to replace the GNC, but it was forced to move east from Tripoli after Libya Dawn seized control of the capital in September.</p>

<p>Officially, Leon has been attempting to broker a peace agreement between the HoR and GNC to form a unity government and end an ongoing civil war that has killed over 4,000 people in 18 months.</p>

<p>But the email published last week shows that Leon, in consultation with the UAE, planned to make the GNC “disappear”.</p>
