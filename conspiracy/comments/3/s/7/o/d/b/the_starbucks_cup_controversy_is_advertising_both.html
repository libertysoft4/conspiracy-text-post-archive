        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>These people who are mad at Starbucks were mostly hired by Starbucks to publicly &quot;attack&quot; them, which fits in nicely to the &quot;war on Christmas&quot; narrative. People are attracted to the controversy and Starbucks gets tons of exposure. </p>

<p>It&#39;s similar to native advertising. Native advertising focuses on buying upvotes and planting comments and upvotes to make certain narratives look popular, which is frequent on reddit. But because people are naturally attracted to controversy, the story gets repeated everywhere, so they don&#39;t even have to buy upvotes. It&#39;s like sex, it sells. People are naturally drawn to it through some primal instincts, and they use that knowledge to draw people&#39;s attention to their product. The Starbucks &quot;controversy&quot; is on reddit, it&#39;s on facebook, people I know mentioned it in person. </p>

<p>The controversy is the commodity they use to attract viewers, but the controversy is largely falsely generated by Starbucks to attract attention. Most of the people being outraged come <em>after</em> the original falsified outrage paid for by starbucks has been aired on fox news or whatever. They hire a company to find these vocal christian loons and stir them up about this particular story and then give them an audience by allowing them to speak on tv about this particular issue. This fuels the controversy which drives views. It makes it look like there&#39;s a bunch of people who are seriously outraged about this thing, even though there might only be 5 in total and they&#39;re being handed microphones and given interviews left and right. </p>

<p>Most importantly, this type of &quot;advertising through controversy&quot; generates <em>organic</em> views (and organic community-driven upvotes and comments) from places like reddit who are amazed that the controversy exists in the first place and upvote it to mock those people fighting starbucks (who don&#39;t really exist in any large numbers in the first place). So &quot;everyone&quot; is laughing at &quot;everyone&quot; being pissed at a company, and meanwhile everyone is repeating &quot;Starbucks&quot; over and over and talking about their cup designs. It&#39;s advertising. People need to get real. </p>

<p>There are so many distracted ignorant people who are wasting so much time on simulated controversy and it&#39;s one big reason why our culture, society, and government are crumbling. They think they are looking at something that matters, but is in actuality completely unimportant. This is the circus of the modern day. These &quot;organic&quot; controversies, that are, in reality, largely advertising and distractions. You see this pattern everywhere once you start looking for it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regardless of what you feel about transgenderism being a real or created phenomenon, I&#39;d be wary about buying into the label of &quot;mentally ill&quot; that&#39;s applied to them. Labelling people &quot;mentally ill&quot; has a long history of marginalizing certain groups of people and denying them rights, while the majority of the public supports such actions. </p>

<p>I give you two worrying trends. First, more and more people are being labelled mentally ill. While I think certain conditions are becoming more prevalent (and that alone is worrisome), another factor is a widening definition of the term. People who believe in conspiracy theories have and will be officially deemed mentally ill.</p>

<p>The second trend is that every time gun control is brought up in the context of mass shootings, mental illness is brought up. Now, keeping firearms out of the hands of a schizophrenic who has homicidal tendencies might be a good thing in the short term (<em>might</em>), but it sets up a dangerous precedent: the government can revoke your constitutional rights because it deems you mentally ill. </p>

<p>What&#39;s to stop them from saying you can&#39;t drive a car, or work certain jobs, things which aren&#39;t even constitutionally guaranteed? What if they can restrict where you are allowed to live, with whom you may freely associate, etc? All of these can be argued based on the same logic: for the sake of public safety, we must restrict the rights of those whom we deem mentally ill and unsafe for society. </p>

<p>This is not about whether a transgender person is mentally ill; it&#39;s about what happens when we casually accept this label for groups of people with whom we disagree. This is one more line along which we will be divided, and a divided populace is that much easier to control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do schizophrenics see things? Do transgender people see themselves as something else? Mental disorder. Not saying they should be locked up and sedated or killed or deprived of rights. They should be helped, just like other mentally ill people. However, they should not be held as normal and made into &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;brave&quot;. There is an agenda. I do not encourage my schizophrenic aunt to pursue her delusions. I love her and communicate to the best I can. I think you misunderstand me/what I said.</p>

I don&#39;t think you want to deprive them of rights, nor that you feel they are lesser. I did not know your aunt was schizophrenic, and I meant no offense by using that in my example.</p>

<p>My comment was not so much toward you as it was a tangent on what I see as a troubling confluence of trends, and a certain casualness of using the term &quot;mentally ill&quot; in general. I don&#39;t want to get into the specifics of transgenderism, and though that inspired my comment, it&#39;s probably not the best example.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No publicity is bad publicity. Get publocity and suddenly free exposure. Free exposure is good when you need free advertising. So what is happening is Starbucks is not meeting its targets and needs more people drinking their coffee. Solution: get more people to know about starbucks. With a simple cotroversy that is completely bullshit in the scale of cotroversies. </p>

<p>Aint gonna stop ppl buying starbucks because of the colour of the cups lol. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This has kinda been a hot topic in r/atheism lately; however, I don&#39;t believe we (r/atheism) was paid off by Starbucks. (I understand what you&#39;re saying but I&#39;m stressing not <em>all</em> people talking about it on unique platforms were paid off for it--although the social media falsification is a problem. E.g. Meek Mill &amp; Drake&#39;s &quot;beef&quot; was a publicity stunt to promote both of their upcoming releases.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regardless of what you feel about transgenderism being a real or created phenomenon, I&#39;d be wary about buying into the label of &quot;mentally ill&quot; that&#39;s applied to them. Labelling people &quot;mentally ill&quot; has a long history of marginalizing certain groups of people and denying them rights, while the majority of the public supports such actions. </p>

<p>I give you two worrying trends. First, more and more people are being labelled mentally ill. While I think certain conditions are becoming more prevalent (and that alone is worrisome), another factor is a widening definition of the term. People who believe in conspiracy theories have and will be officially deemed mentally ill.</p>

<p>The second trend is that every time gun control is brought up in the context of mass shootings, mental illness is brought up. Now, keeping firearms out of the hands of a schizophrenic who has homicidal tendencies might be a good thing in the short term (<em>might</em>), but it sets up a dangerous precedent: the government can revoke your constitutional rights because it deems you mentally ill. </p>

<p>What&#39;s to stop them from saying you can&#39;t drive a car, or work certain jobs, things which aren&#39;t even constitutionally guaranteed? What if they can restrict where you are allowed to live, with whom you may freely associate, etc? All of these can be argued based on the same logic: for the sake of public safety, we must restrict the rights of those whom we deem mentally ill and unsafe for society. </p>

<p>This is not about whether a transgender person is mentally ill; it&#39;s about what happens when we casually accept this label for groups of people with whom we disagree. This is one more line along which we will be divided, and a divided populace is that much easier to control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cool that is great. Not everyone lives near their loved ones. No one is making you use Facebook. It does not mean that other people don&#39;t use it for its intended purpose and get joy/entertainment/companionship from connecting with friends. </p>

<p>I find that people who say facebook is an obstacle in their life will likely just find something else to call an obstacle anyways, its a ridiculous notion. </p>
