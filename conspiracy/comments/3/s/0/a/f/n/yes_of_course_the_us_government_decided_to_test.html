The fantastic discourse in this sub is why i come here so often. I will try and update with some of the great info that has been provided by you awesome guys.</p>

<p>Original video that started controversy linked by <a href="/u/3rdEyeBall">/u/3rdEyeBall</a> who claims to have been present for event(story not yet confirmed to my knowledge):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/3ryr81/best_footage_of_the_unidentified_flying_object/cwshn5x">x-post from /r/videos /u/homeschooled</a></p>

<p>Very similar video of previous event from <a href="/u/heuheu">/u/heuheu</a> :</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnszlJC8iGs&amp;app=desktop">Video from China, same (story of similar rocket test)</a></p>

<p><a href="/u/Willertz">/u/Willertz</a> Updated us with a similar incident from Iceland:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ra7FMnpWMhY">Video from Iceland, same (story of similar rocket test from Russia)</a></p>

<p>Edit: <a href="/u/Perceptions_">/u/Perceptions_</a> informed me this incident took place in Norway</p>

<p>Article from abc LA published Friday Nov 6 at 11:59PM that planes were being diverted for a week by undisclosed secret Military Operations provided by <a href="/u/MurrueLaFlaga">/u/MurrueLaFlaga</a>:</p>

<p><a href="http://abc7.com/news/secret-military-operations-to-divert-lax-planes-for-a-week/1072890/">Secret Military Operations to DIvert LAX Planes for a Week</a></p>

<p><a href="/u/Willertz">/u/Willertz</a> is on it today, a great map of viewing distance for high altitude objects: </p>

<p><a href="http://i.space.com/images/i/000/034/454/original/ors-3-launch-viewing-map-first-sighting.jpg?1384535086">Time elapsed before sight 5 degrees above horizon by distance</a></p>

<p>Link to &quot;Frank Bruenjes Astronomy&quot; (an independent astronomer) who has images of similar rocket tests for comparison provided by <a href="/u/Bohemos">/u/Bohemos</a>:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.moonglow.net/ccd/pictures/rocket/">Frank Bruenjes Astronomy Rocket Launches</a></p>

<p>Haven&#39;t seen a source confirming this information but <a href="/u/jesusloves_you">/u/jesusloves_you</a> has information making me more scheptical about the source of the phenomena:</p>

<p>&quot;Trident II missiles have a red flame, and Russian ICBM&#39;s have a stunning blue flame that leaves a huge blue trail long after the missile is gone. And this ICBM had a stunning blue flame that left a glowing trail in the sky for 15 minutes after the launch. AND HERE IS THE KICKER: ITS TRAJECTORY APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN ONE THAT WOULD HAVE MADE IT GO OVER SIBERIA/RUSSIA AND INTO MAINLAND CHINA. Figure the odds for that one. America would not test fire an ICBM on a trajectory for Russia!&quot;

<p>I&#39;ll have more in another update, balancing between Football and Conspiring right now! Keep up the good discorse <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> 
Send me a PM if you feel like I missed crutial evidence for discussion and I will try to get it in my next update!</p>

<p>Update 2: Thanks so much to <a href="/u/PlainWithCheese">/u/PlainWithCheese</a> for messaging me the links to the two videos he/she captured of the event and posted. The links are right here:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>heres my problems with the missile explanation:</p>

<p>dont missles cruise at about 30,000MPH?  so in the time that it was being filmed, if it were launched around LA, it would have been somewhere near the rocky mountains by the end of the video.  </p>

<p>also, why the hell would you practice launching missiles over LA?  theres a few thousand miles of coastline there.   did they have to do it over one of americas most populated cities?  that would be unsafe and they know it, even if the missile were inert.  </p>

<p>i dont know what is in that video, but the facts dont add up and it doesnt take a conspiracy theorist to see that.  and now all the posts are getting downvoted if they go against the official story.  something is not right here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I Was There™. We all saw it. The government lied at first about the Navy testing something for the FAA (according to local news about an hour after it occurred). </p>

<p>Now they&#39;re lying again. This was not a missile. It left a huge plume in the upper atmosphere that glowed like the aurora for several minutes. The effect wasn&#39;t well represented in the video but to the naked eye it was more prominent.  </p>

<p>At that distance the scale is wrong for anything like that - we&#39;re talking about something high up in the upper atmosphere to be seen in other states.  The scale of the missile to make a ball of light that size has to be staggering.  IMO it remains a UFO (by definition) and the government is lying (standard operating procedure) by taking responsibility in order to quell the inquiries.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again - lets not dismiss the data.</p>

<p>Range estimates of the anomaly are low-earth-orbit to have been witnessed in Arizona.  At that range, what man-made object is capable of displaying that kind of illumination?  What are the scales here, and how large would the object have to be?</p>

<p>We have to watch our own rockets through telescopes to get a view of that size to the naked eye.  Also where&#39;s the contrail/smoke trail from such a rocket?  I&#39;m leaning towards &quot;maybe-a-military-space-craft&quot;, but how large would it need to be to satisfy the scale of what we saw?</p>

<p>Even though they have reproduced the thrust effect, i believe what i read was that they have to recreate the experiments now on a different scale or something, because of the interference of the equipment during the testing, even though the testing has been confirmed by several different teams. </p>

But that&#39;s a lot of employees and low level ones too that would have to be going along with the lie that flight patterns were altered for at least a week before the incident. 
I&#39;m not saying maybe the military isn&#39;t testing something other than a missile, but when they say they are going to be doing testing in the area where this happened way ahead of time doesn&#39;t that kind of end the argument?

    <div class="md"><p>A) Launches like this are classified, foreign powers would love the chance to document how this missile behaves on launch and afterwards. Since we don&#39;t want potential weaknesses in missiles found, we don&#39;t tell anyone when we&#39;re launching. (or in the case of LAX, the give a broad enough time frame so that they can keep people safe, but also not tip off anyone about what specifically is going on).</p>

<p>B) It wasn&#39;t directly over a populated area, it was quite a ways off-shore, the Trident is an SLBM, or Submarine-Launched-Ballistic-Missile.</p>

<p>C) Tridents maintain a low orbit for a few minutes after launch (about the same amount of time people from other states mentioned seeing this), and then it was probably detonated (minus the nuke of course).</p>

<p>D) Scientists speculate, if they specialize in meteorological phenomena, they&#39;ll see meteorological phenomena, not missiles.

<p>Edit: forgot I was on the conspiracy theory sub. If you have a such a big problem with me saying international politics is complicated and history greater than what&#39;s just happened in te last 50 years can still affect today, then I&#39;m just at a loss for words. And obviously when you&#39;re the most powerful nation in the world you&#39;ll have the greatest impact on the world and it&#39;s easy to look at all the bad things someone had done and forget all the good things someone had done. Sheesh, compared to Great Britain and Europe the US is nothing. The U.S. Has been having to deal with the shit Europe created for a long time. Maybe if Europe didn&#39;t rape and pillage just about everywhere on earth we wouldn&#39;t be in this mess. At the same time, maybe we&#39;d be worse off than we are now!</p>

<p>But then, full discloser, we heard that similar and maybe more intense phenomenon were seen in LA. At first consideration, no one would think that they are witnessing the same thing, I mean LA is 400 miles away. However, it&#39;s <em>was</em> an easier conclusion to believe that the incidents were related and not just a coincidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My wildest hypothesis is that it was a wormhole opening in a fixed point in space.  Given the earth&#39;s rotation (~1000mph) in relation to the anomaly it would give ground-viewers the illusion of movement.  But then someone would have to confirm if the rotation is in the right direction because I lack the data myself.</p>

<p>Also what kinds of measurable effects would there be to confirm this?  I&#39;d hoped to get more out-of-the-box thinking in this sub.</p>

<p>Ultimately all of the phenomena must be taken into account to give an explanation but the missile excuse is 100% bullshit.  But we already know the US government has no credibility.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If it were a wormhole that was fixed in space and you wanted to account for the rotation of the earth, you&#39;d have to account for the movement of the earth around the sun, the sun around the galaxy, etc., which doesn&#39;t work out. What if we say the wormhole appeared in the sky but began orbiting the earth? Well, it looks like it has a similar velocity to the ISS, but considering the expansion of the smoke cloud, it would&#39;ve needed a lot of explosion power to have made that, assuming that it is indeed at LEO (low earth orbit). Honestly, I&#39;d believe it was the ISS that blew up before I went ahead and said it was a wormhole.</p>

But if you just wanna brainstorm theories then mine is that this was a top secret government fighter craft that posses the ability to enter low earth orbit and re-enter the atmosphere multiple times. That&#39;s why I believe air traffic has been diverted for a week before this and all in a straight flight path from the mid pacific to over California and Arizona  from 30,000 feet to 100,000 feet. This could also be a missile like the official story states but something feels off about this one I think. </p>

<p>It&#39;s absolutely far-fetched, but having seen it with my own eyes it&#39;s not like the behavior of the missile videos.  There was no boost-phase trail whatsoever.  It just appeared, which is why at first I wondered if a satellite had burned up and it&#39;s fuel exploded; the more I think about that it makes no sense either.  A proper explanation must take into account all of the observed phenomena.</p>

<p>Its blue because it was the 3rd stage igniting, burning fuel high in nitrates. It was at 6pm, and given that it was in its 3rd stage, pretty damn high up.

    <div class="md"><p>That Titan V is gorgeous, thanks for sharing.  I&#39;d already looked it up for comparison earlier.  But sadly that is not what we saw last night.  Not even close.</p>

<p>The object we witnessed was not traversing the sky at that speed.  Also it left a trail distinct and dissimilar to the rockets we see today.  edit: grammar</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also got a problem with this Nov. 7th footage.  Why does it look nothing like all the other footage?  Is this an <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to inject irrelevant and dated videos to confuse eye witness accounts?  Where is this airfield from the twitter posting?

    <div class="md"><p>Because from <em>all the way over</em> in <strong>Florida</strong>, this tweeter could not have possiblly had <strong>any</strong> angle on last night&#39;s event.  I think you got caught in a troll-trap.</p>

<p>Nor does his posted video even remotely compare to what we saw off the west coast <em>and</em> <strong>over the ocean</strong> leaving <strong>absolutely zero rocket trail</strong> in it&#39;s wake as it tacked northwards.</p>

<p>What it did leave in it&#39;s wake appeared to be some kind of ionized plume with a distinct glow that was more brilliant to the naked eye than the camera.  Nothing like the tweet video you posted above which is very clearly a rocket-trail.  <a href="https://youtu.be/yu7mNmqJJ10?t=1m2s">Here&#39;s last night&#39;s encounter</a>, for comparison.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just going to throw this out there: What if you are looking at it from a much more extreme angle behind the rocket as it flies away from the camera?  It would cause it to look very different from that sharp perspective. </p>

<p>Also, if the sun had just set, once the rocket got high enough, the rocket trail would seem to glow like it did because it would be catching the last rays of light from the sun at the higher altitude. When it transitions from what looks like a traditional rocket fireball to  the blue plume, it has probably reached that point in the atmosphere where the sunlight is still hitting. </p>

<p>Who knows though, just a thought. </p>

<p>At that distance the scale is wrong for anything like that - we&#39;re talking about something high up in the upper atmosphere to be seen in other states. The scale of the missile to make a ball of light that size has to be staggering. </p>

<p>That&#39;s just not true at all and you clearly have no idea what you&#39;re talking about.</p>

<p>It looks exactly like the exhaust being lit but by the sun from any other ballistic missile/rocket. Obviously it would be seen in other states.</p>

<p>The cloud of exhaust expands and is incredibly high in the atmosphere. Obviously it would be seen across a large area around the west coast, have you ever seen a video of a rocket launch?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obviously there would be a boost-phase rocket trail and you still don&#39;t get LEO do you?  We&#39;re talking 64-100 miles away at that size and brilliance would no longer be visible to the naked eye.</p>

<p>If this was simply a 2nd stage of a missile it would not have been visible in Phoenix.  By the time that missile had reached the altitude to have line of sight on Nevada and Arizona it would already appear so small they wouldn&#39;t have even taken notice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Show me a single video of a rocket launch that has a visible rocket trail at night once it reaches significant altitude. </p>

<p>The missile itself may be small to the naked eye but those gases expand very quickly and their brilliance is due to them being lit up by the sun against a pitch black sky. </p>

<p>Did you watch this video and see the accompanying breakdown of the video in the thread by <a href="/u/owlsexterminator">/u/owlsexterminator</a>?</p>

<p>It very clearly goes through all the distinct phases associated with a simulated SLBM launch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The trail is not going to be visible unless the sun is reflecting off of it. Once it reached sufficient altitude you started to be able to see the trail, especially once the second stage activated and the brilliant blue light reflected off the nitrates. </p>

<p>Making it look just like the Atlas V rocket in the video I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve already seen.</p>

<p>Did you look at the video analysis by <a href="/u/owlsexterminator">/u/owlsexterminator</a>? </p>

<p>The missile very clearly goes through all the different motions of a simulated test. Independent warhead launches and everything.</p>

<p>It looks exactly like a SLBM. How do you possibly explain all those matching manoeuvres consistent with a Trident II?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was sitting on the beach in Carlsbad, San Diego CA. with a group of friends and we saw the entire spectacle from start to finish. I have a long video I took shot with my phone that I have yet to post. Other people around us were initially amazed as to what we were observing, but after the it continued to streak through the sky for over a minute or so, people started getting in their cars preparing to leave. The streaking light looked like it was about to fizzle out and disappear, and suddenly after it had been streaking through the sky for over 2 and a half minutes, it seemed as though it &quot;exploded&quot; and began to emit a bright blueish-green light. At this point many people around us had felt as if it was unsafe to stay, and the parking lot cleared out fast. This expanding bright light soon expanded to fill a large amount of the sky before it began to disappear. From the perspective that we had, the light originated from the south-west of us. Although it was likely hundreds of miles away, the scale of whatever this was made it seem like it was not too far offshore. The entire event lasted around 3-4 minutes, yet the residual glow in the sky hung around for quite a while afterwards.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, but that is normal behavior for meteors.  As they break up they expose different elements closer to their core.  This causes a shift in tail color.</p>

<p>Looked like a meteor to me.  I wanted it to be an alien craft or something else cool but really it&#39;s pretty benign.  Unless it&#39;s some secret military tech.  Rockets don&#39;t look like that.</p>

<p>I have no doubt the navy was also testing something.....HMM.  perhaps the navy was testing shooting at meteors with lasers?  This would be a great way to keep population centers safe from any airborn threat, yet the population would freak out over testing.  They would also freak out if they knew they were under threat to begin with.  Keeping quiet causes the least amount of damage (riots).  Let the public  know years later they were saved from a catastrophic meteor threat? makes sense to me.</p>

<p>This is also why it&#39;s a global event.  Meteors don&#39;t give a shit where they land.  Which also syncs up with the meteor shower we&#39;re getting over the next month...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Serious question - Do we not have enough spottings or videos to deduce the general area where it passed over the coastline?</p>

<p>It seems easy if we just start with &quot;witnesses in Cities-XYZ saw it in the southern sky&quot;, and &quot;witnesses in Cities-ABC saw it in the northern sky&quot; and work from there. </p>

<p>Obviously it&#39;d be good to have some shots from multiple locations that show the angle/distance from the horizon to get a little more scientific, but it&#39;d be good to know where this actually passed over considering a lot of the discussion that I&#39;m seeing is about whether it&#39;s safe to run a &quot;test&quot; like this over a population center.</p>

<p>It was a big deal when it happened. There was speculation that it was the Chinese who fired it off but I had Naval Commander from Magu that I met (who I asked right after it happened) swear up and down that it was not the Chinese.  It still didn&#39;t convince me.</p>

<p>The one last night definitely was higher profile, everyone seemed to notice it. The one from 2010 was launched at dusk and was harder to see.</p>

Also, depending on the point of origin and direction (I haven&#39;t seen specifics on either) that&#39;s hardly impossible given that the range on that type of missile is over 4,000 miles.  Say bullshit all you want if it makes you confident it wasn&#39;t a missile test and that&#39;s somehow important to you though.  What motivation the military would have for lying about this I can&#39;t imagine.  They warned LAX and notified the public so it&#39;s not like it was a big secret.</p>

<p>One minute before America was supposed to test fire a Trident, Russia fires theirs in close proximity to where America&#39;s was supposed to launch from. What would this mean? It would mean: We can break your encryption, know what you were going to do, hide from you right where you are looking and do it on your own schedule! I would not be surprised if that is what really went on. That would be quite the chess board.</p>

<p>Even if this missile really was American, the fact one got fired at all, at $31 million a pop for the type claimed, would send an ominous message. And what was the schedule for these war games? Not on the drawing board before that shoot down over Egypt.</p>

<p>Who knows why they were firing this missile when they did, maybe it was just a test. Seems like the &quot;Just a missile test&quot; after the fact is a bit sketchy, they&#39;ve announced tests like this in the past ahead of time, but no idea if that&#39;s normal or abnormal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The story that the Navy disclosed is that was a test of a submarine-launched ICBM. In a real nuclear war, you don&#39;t have two weeks to prepare to fire the missile at a certain time, you have 10 seconds, so the exact time of the launch likely wasn&#39;t told to the crew of the submarine until minutes before it was time for liftoff. </p>

<p>LAX was told to divert flights from the area during the  week-long window they expected to conduct the test, but giving more information would have removed the sense of surprise/urgency that make the test of crew readiness and missile systems valuable.</p>

<p>So naturally I play it on my tv and they start freaking out. We live in Las Vegas. They said last night around 6:00 pm they saw this directly overhead! They were super confused and weirded out at the time. My sister in law told their youngest daughter &quot;it must be a helicopter&quot; so as to not freak her out, even though they couldn&#39;t see it or hear anything. </p>

<p>They said it looked EXACTLY like that, like a bright light shining through clouds (even though there are no clouds in sight last night). They said it lasted a minute or so then disappeared. </p>

<p>Could this be the same event? They didn&#39;t say a direction of travel only that it was DIRECTLY overhead... Not west like the LA one</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because people typically don&#39;t panic because of something like this... Case in point.. this test happened and the public who saw it filmed it and put it online and nobody went running for their doomsday bunkers or started jamming up the highways trying to escape.  Why?  Because it looks like a missile test and other people are too busy filming it thinking they are seeing ET and that doesn&#39;t scare anyone into a panic either.  </p>

<p>Now what happens if they announce ahead of time that they are going to be doing a missile launch test?  Thousands of online bloggers and Alex Jones start stirring up a story that this isn&#39;t just a test or that the reason they are running this test is because something BIG is about to happen with Russia, etc.  There is more chance of causing a panic that way because now you&#39;ve given people time to think about what&#39;s <em>really</em> happening.  There is no way to go about doing something like this correctly because there will always be a contingent of people who don&#39;t believe what they are being told no matter what.  </p>

<p>Look what happened when they announced the Jade Helm training exercises.... It was months of people being convinced that the government was going to have troops pop out of abandoned Wal Marts and shoot them or round them up into FEMA camps.  </p>

<p>If I could just find the exact time the LAX flight rerouting order for this week was issued, and compare that to the missile time, then that&#39;d be very telling. If the LAX order came after the missile, that would imply a reaction, which would imply #2 to be true. </p>

<p>I think folks still don&#39;t get <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction">M.A.D.</a> - missiles aren&#39;t angry tweets that nations fire at each other in casual fashion, just to get their attention.  Any such act by any nation would provoke a swift and severe response.  Being we&#39;re not ashes by now suggests Robert J. Oppenheimer is still right: that the very destructiveness of nuclear weapons makes war between nuclear-nations obsolete.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>SO, any readers of American Kabuki here?  A.K. had been delayed posting anew, but it came out today, in relation to the Missile launch.  Two missiles were launched  from the base underneath malibu, ca, and both were intercepted, through a joint S.A. (sphere alliance) and Earth Based military (US navy submarine) effort.  The one Missile that did make it out, and turned towards the East, was said to have the potential to make it To Central US targets, although aimed at the eastern seaboard, based on Trajectory.  The Base underneath Malibu was an advanced medical base, wherein replacement parts were cloned for &quot;Public Figures&quot; (This is where Hitlary&#39;s new retina was &quot;growed&quot; after her little &#39;plane accident&quot; in IRAN, years back.

I&#39;m sure Bethesda payed them both for an elaborate PR stunt that would totally be practical to advertise a videogame. There&#39;ll be a video released any day after the Fallout 4 release where Obama and his cabinet are partying with the Chinese commie leadership decide to combine our nation&#39;s together. It ain&#39;t world peace but its a nice step towards it. One can dream. </p>

<p>I think folks still don&#39;t get <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction">M.A.D.</a> - missiles aren&#39;t angry tweets that nations fire at each other in casual fashion, just to get their attention.  Any such act by any nation would provoke a swift and severe response.  Being we&#39;re not ashes by now suggests Robert J. Oppenheimer is still right: that the very destructiveness of nuclear weapons makes war between nuclear-nations obsolete.</p>

<p>I misunderstood then. The object I saw with my own two eyes from 15 miles southeast of LA was obviously not to the north.</p>
