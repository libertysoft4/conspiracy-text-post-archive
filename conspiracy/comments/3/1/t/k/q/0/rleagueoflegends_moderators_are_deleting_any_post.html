<p>Here is the link for those interested.  <del>I will update this thread with the vod when it is released.</del></p>

<p>tl;dr Recently, it was exposed that moderators of <a href="/r/leagueoflegends">/r/leagueoflegends</a> were required to sign an NDA with Riot Games (the creators of League of Legends).  Richard Lewis, a famous e-sports journalist and frequenter of <a href="/r/leagueoflegends">/r/leagueoflegends</a> was banned unjustly for witch hunting.  He is now interviewing a former mod of <a href="/r/leagueoflegends">/r/leagueoflegends</a> and exposing many of the shady tactics that go on within reddit&#39;s mod community.</p>

<p>Thought this was pretty interesting, especially since I was recently linked the &quot;How Reddit Was Destroyed(V3)&quot; post from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a></p>

<p>update: still waiting on the youtube VOD.  The stream is currently offline, butI updated with a link to the Twitch.tv VOD (it&#39;s a really shitty vod format.  I&#39;ll update w/ youtube when I see it)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, a non-disclosure agreement, sorry for just using the abbreviation.  What information that they are required to keep under wraps is unknown, but honestly riot games is generally a fairly decent company.  That being said, the way that they are being allowed to manipulate the subreddit to remove any damning information is the crux of this issue, and why it&#39;s important imo.  It&#39;s a problem with this entire site, and honestly I don&#39;t think it will ever be fixed.  Thanks, Conde Nast</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well apart from the SpectateFaker and StarLordLucian incidents along with limiting streaming options in player contracts and inconsistent referral prizes (especially with TotalBiscuit) and a shit ton of other stuff regarding their near absolute power over any player input within the community, yeah Riot Games is a fairly decent company.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those are all valid points, but I know at least the streaming rights issue was overturned after the community lashed back against them and there&#39;s something to be said about a company that listens to its customers.  Definitely something to remember when choosing whether or not you support them or not.  Personally, I enjoy the game and they do a lot of great stuff for the players, so until I have enough of a reason to stop, I will continue to play their game and support them</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t find the link anymore, but there were some stats released about the average player age, and they overlapped fairly closely with the average age of redditors.</p>

<p>Besides, who <em>doesn&#39;t</em> know about reddit?  It&#39;s referenced frequently in mainstream news sources and gets millions of hits daily, combined with league being the largest online playerbase in the world, and you get the idea</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely, especially if it were hosted in the united states.  Too much shit they can pin you with if illegal stuff is getting hosted on your website.  It&#39;s kind of a difficult scenario, because mods are just as human as the people they will be moderating.  I think having a regular community vote to decide the moderators for the next month/year would probably be a good choice.  There would definitely have to be some sort of system in place to prevent career moderators, and honestly I don&#39;t know the best solution for that.  Human nature is too fickle imo.  I don&#39;t think this problem will ever realistically be solved permanently (regardless of if it&#39;s just some stupid internet moderators or politicians, the issue remains the same), but then I&#39;ve become quite cynical in the past few years.  Who knows</p>

<p>also, shameless plug for voat.co (reddit alternative)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well i loss my skype because of either reporting or false password spamming, i could dig for the info but it would be hard and there is some information that i wouldnt want to let out since they talk about their person lives and stuff.</p>

<p>Almost everything i sent to richard was a screenshot and not all of it was saved locally in my screenshot folders</p>

<p>so tl;dr i dont even have direct access to most but if you have questions feel free to ask lol.</p>

<p>Basically what you need to know is the mods dont want to enforce just rules they want to enforce their opinion of how the sub should change</p>

Five games in, four had at least one player spitting profanities and hate on either my or the other team.
