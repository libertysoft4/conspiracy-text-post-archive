<p>Not certain what you mean here. I see a lot of posts here complaining &quot;My post was deleted from subreddit X&quot;. However, I have yet to see a case where this wasn&#39;t because the post breached that subreddit&#39;s rules. For instance, <a href="/r/TIL">/r/TIL</a> very clearly states, &quot;No news&quot; and &quot;No recent politics.&quot; <a href="/r/worldness">/r/worldness</a> prohibits US news, editorialized titles and blogspam. Enforcing these certainly doesn&#39;t count as &quot;censoring anything that doesn&#39;t confirm their world view.&quot;</p>

<p>If you mean something else, however, I apologize and would need more specifics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a continuation of the  known CIA op to have people associate conspiracy as a pejorative.  It worked and now people have an irrational emotional reaction to just hearing the word &quot;conspiracy&quot;.  They want to see themselves as part of the &quot;normal group&quot;, so they attempt to convince others to go along with them and you end up with groupthink.</p>

<p>The funny thing is that CIA op that I mentioned?  It is well-known to the public, yet people still continue the behavior in spite of being told they have been psychologically manipulated by their own government.</p>

Not sure why you would take it that way. I just want a place thats not heavily censored, doesn&#39;t tow the company line, and has a collection of people with different perspectives having an open forum of discussion. I don&#39;t come here thinking I&#39;m some enlightened person mocking the &quot;sheeple&quot;...so when I see people come in here (multiple times a day, multiple people a day) that make fun of this sub and some of its users...its just annoying. Probably because of the nature of this sub...I guess that&#39;s what comes with the territory when you let everyone speak their mind. On subs like SRS, you poke fun at someone? BANNED immediately...or most subs for that matter. It&#39;s just that people like you detract from the better parts of this sub, and bring it down...all because you have a tendency to make fun of other people instead of just carrying on and realizing there&#39;s people out there that see things differently from you. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you can see that there is a difference between &quot;disagreement&quot; (i.e. &quot;I don&#39;t agree with you and here&#39;s why&quot;) and &quot;this sub sucks and everyone on it are morons and crazy people&quot;, without any sort of point beyond that.</p>

<p>it isn&#39;t a conspiracy, it isn&#39;t relevant to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, it&#39;s neo-nazi white supremacist propaganda bullshit that is easily demolished using simple logic - the proof of this is in the fact that I do that every time it&#39;s posted and all of the nazi apologist posters prove they are not here to engage in meaningful or rational discussion by proceeding completely like trolls for the rest of the thread.</p>

<p>They are trolls, they are not here for dialogue or anything honest. It&#39;s obvious, this is why they should be removed from this subreddit. They are here vote brigading it, using alts to troll and boost their posts/downvote their critics, and making shit up in general. They are trolls, and they are probably from <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> trying to suck people here into a nazi apology bait-and-switch - maybe you are too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t tell if you&#39;re being serious or facetious..</p>

<p>The last thing I&#39;d expect to be called is a &quot;shill&quot;. I&#39;ve been posting here for years, was trolled relentlessly in the past for that very reason to extent of being stalked and receiving death threats, have done nothing defend his sub in the past only to be ridiculed repeatedly, was a mod here at one point, and continue to post content and discuss topics regularly most people on reddit wouldn&#39;t even touch, let alone anything an actual shill would post. </p>

<p>If serious, you seem to suggest anyone who happens to disagree with your opinion on certain content is a &quot;shill&quot; and thus opposed to the sub by default, which you and I know is complete and utter bullshit. I&#39;m beginning to suspect your accusation, if literal, may in fact be a form of projection, a tactic used to draw attention away from <a href="https://prod01-cdn00.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2014/02/deception_p48.png">your intent to create tension</a> and sow discord.</p>

<p>your accusation, if literal, may in fact be a form of projection, a tactic used to draw attention away from your intent to create tension and sow discord.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and no one called you a shill, you are over-personalizing everything and misrepresenting reality to suit yourself on a personal level or to detract from the logic in everything that I say, maybe that&#39;s why you were called a shill before, I don&#39;t know but I don&#39;t want to get into the &quot;whys&quot; of your life story with you. You certainly do try to detract from the actual issues being discussed and try to drag the conversation to a personal level all the time - every time you post - which is what shills do.</p>

<p>So what else is anyone to think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It looks to me as more of an attempt to mock conspiracy theorists and paint all conspiracies as bullshit and those that believe them as nuts. Considering how many conspiracy theories have actually turned out to be true it doesn&#39;t seem like it should be a joking manner. Just think if this happened a decade ago the sub would be full of comments about mass surveillance and implying how stupid anyone is for thinking that exists; or if this happened even longer ago we&#39;d all be nuts for thinking the government secretly doses prisoners and college students with LSD to attempt mind control or pays major journalists to spin the news...

<p>You would see how this would make some users paranoid? Especially since we deal with shadowbans all the time.

By the sound of it and the looks of it its just tactics to discredit this sub and its ideas. Text book. </p>

<p>Yeah I get its jokes but why \conspiracy? The main spirit of the sub is to question everything. Y&#39;all playing a useless game and making reddit insufferable</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;much more successful&quot; ..  Please define &quot;successful&quot;.  Actually, don&#39;t bother.  I already know the answer.</p>

<p>I&#39;m quite &quot;successful&quot; using your capitalistic definition.  But, I&#39;m also quite intelligent and can think for myself.</p>

<p>Pulling that crap is only funny to those that enjoy making fun of people that do not conform, and you all know this.  Being veiled as some sort of april fools joke is ridiculous at best, and you all know this.  I realize that none of you will ever admit it, but don&#39;t worry, we know.</p>

<p>When everyone is done laughing, when it&#39;s too late to change, reddit and this petty BS will be the last thing on anyone&#39;s mind.</p>

<p>Enjoy your average jokes, average intelligence and average understanding of reality. Say hi to your average wife for me. Get into your average car and go to your average job.  You have average taxes to pay and average consumer goods to purchase in order to make yourself feel better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just because people believe in some things out of the typical mass media narrative, that makes them a group worth lumping together and making judgements about? </p>

<p>You also mentioned how we chose to be a part of this community- this sub or the &quot;conspiracy community&quot;? Either way, is having beliefs really a choice? Wouldn&#39;t choosing your beliefs make them insincere? Can we make sweeping judgements about Christians, Muslims and Jews because they all, daily, reaffirm their conscious choice of religion? </p>

<p>Your logic is incredibly shaky. I would also agree with you on a certain level, there is no conspiracy community in the real world being marginalized. There are groups that use the term &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; to discredit people trying to expose information harmful to their interests. </p>

<p>And using that type of logic to come into this sub and shout at the users about how they are overly paranoid just like the classic caricature of a theorist goes and it&#39;s &quot;just April Fools!&quot;? Ridiculous. People try to derail discussions in this sub daily. The CIA literally launched a psyop based on using that term to discredit people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People lump groups together all the time. You don&#39;t have a problem lumping together &quot;Democrats&quot;, &quot;Republicans&quot;, &quot;politicians&quot;, or &quot;Jews&quot; (a favorite around here), so why shouldn&#39;t anybody else lump you guys together?</p>

<p>Anyone making fun of a group as a whole is going to make the undecided less likely to go to that group. If an undecided voter hears somebody say something bad about Republicans, then that voter is slightly less likely to vote Republican. You guys have no problem lumping non-conspiracy theorists together and making fun of them, making an undecided person less likely to want to be in the in the insulted group. It should work the other way around. Get a sense of humor.</p>
