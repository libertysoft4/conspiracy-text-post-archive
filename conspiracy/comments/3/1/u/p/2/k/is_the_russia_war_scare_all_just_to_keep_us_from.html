<p>With the Ukraine crisis, I think both sides are jumping to exploit the crisis to that end. </p>

The BRICS NDB is a direct threat to the central bankers.

<p>Are we? <em>Seriously</em>? I see very little evidence that is the case. We&#39;re 4 years out from the last major anti-authoritarian movement and even that was largely a joke (OWS). In that time there have certainly been new revelations that have galvanized some people (Snowden) but they seem like a pretty small minority...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You people need to take a college class in IR...</p>

<p>The US has pushed NATO to the borders of Russia - partly because they could, it benefited them and eastern Europe was eager not to get bear-fucked by Russia in the future.
-Russia has a problem with that</p>

<p>The EU has Ukraine in it&#39;s interest for a multitude of reasons, as does getting one more piece of Europe into the US-EU hegemony which would be Ukraine, which has a conflicted history with Russia. </p>

<p>What you are seeing now is an escalation of tensions between One Superpower and a regional power. This has fuck - all to do with controlling people. America&#39;s economy is growing so people will not pay attention in America. Western EU is always skeptical of Russia. The eastern bloc countries have a direct incentive to see Russia pushed into a corner.</p>

<p>Russia is loosing it&#39;s grip on the CIS states and wants to maintain power. It&#39;s understandable. There is no magic. Naturally speaking though projecting an external enemy will embolden putin to do what he wants. A  war? Doubtfully. We already have a massive regional proxy war in the ME now</p>

<p>I can watch the mainstream media and understand that within a minute, they spout what you just spouted out 24/7, however this is just like the cold war, and the cold war was used entirely for population control, there was never a threat of actual war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bullshit there was not a threat of actual war. Sure, the government trumped up the horns and whistles to keep everyone onboard with the idea that communism was evil in order to support policies, but the reality was the same.</p>

<p>The US had a containment policy ala George Kennan and the Soviets had the Brezhnev doctrine. Both countries had some pretty nefarious undertakings internally, but their foreign policy missions were not the response to the possibility of internal strife. Both countries were competing for a global hegemony and the US won. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Honestly, I think this unfairly downplays the very real ideological conflict between the Soviets and the US. The USSR may not have been an ideal socialist state but there were many in the government who were &quot;true believers&quot; and thought that the imperialism they engaged in (in Eastern Europe) and subversive activities they funded around the world were fully justified to protect the people against Capitalist exploitation. Similarly we all know that the US was engaged in identical activities to protect the interests of  Capital owners (but also, in many peoples minds, to protect, freedom/liberty/etc). To state that it was all a ruse to control the respective domestic populations seems to ignore the proxy fights that happened all over the world - where ideologically driven factions were pitted against one another to further each sides world view.</p>
