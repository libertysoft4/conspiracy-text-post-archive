    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the same argument you hear about corruption in non-US friendly states.  </p>

<p>Yes, there is sometimes some corruption- but the leaders are trying to keep the resources for the people, and protect them from colonization.  And so there is always an all out propaganda war on them, and an effort of outside forces to infiltrate and take them down.  Places like chavez&#39; venezuela, or Castro&#39;s Cuba or ghaddafi&#39;s Libya were not bastions of free speech for those trying to incite coupe.  Because they were actually under perpetual threat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This thread is a little strange to me. I&#39;ve been posting on the subject a bit, this is my alt account, don&#39;t use it too much but it&#39;s neither new nor against the sub in any way. Long time lurker, sometimes poster. </p>

<p>The scapegoating to boogeyman outsiders has reached absurd levels at this point. There very well may be outside accounts from the usual subs coming in here, but that doesn&#39;t negate any of the completely reasonable questions about this issue. </p>

<p>The &#39;barbarians at the gate&#39; is the oldest trick in the book to stifle dissent. We are literally being told that it&#39;s only the big bad scary shills that even care about this issue. </p>

<p>After all this, there still has been no explanation for why he is reinstated as a mod. Why, after making the sub look <strong>awful</strong> with the podcast, then abusing mod privileges, is he back? A secret vote by the mods while wholesale dismissing legitimate questions from the community?</p>

<p>His apparently magical ability to spot shills and a standard form apology are not enough, in my opinion, to feel comfortable again with the reinstatement. <em>Especially</em> when it&#39;s been done in this manner sketchy on its face. 
Said it before and I&#39;ll say it again. This whole thing might be perfectly fine and on the level. But it sure isn&#39;t being handled that way. Dissent on the issue has been dismissed as shills and trolls. I don&#39;t doubt that some are. </p>

<p>But using that to dismiss a viewpoint is classic manipulation, and really has tainted this sub with a feeling of being compromised. </p>

<p>For what purpose? No clue. But given the progression of decisions starting with the podcast itself, I can&#39;t be the only one feeling like something is off here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with the sentiment that this sub is compromised. </p>

<p>In amongst all the bullshit that gets posted here, I think a number of people are getting close to the truth. The best way to keep people away from that truth is to make the community seem like a bunch of nutcases (as has always been the case). </p>

<p>The dickheads in all the vote brigading subs are having a field day with this saga. That totes messenger bot sends people to those subs from threads all over reddit all the time. This reinforces the meme that conspiracy theorists are nutbags. </p>

<p>Take for example a thread in <a href="/r/boston">/r/boston</a> on the bombing verdict. A dude then posted some shitty titled post in here with a link to the <a href="/r/boston">/r/boston</a> post. Then the totes messenger bot lets people know that it&#39;s been posted in this sub but with such a title that it makes anyone in there immediately dismiss the post and further tarnishes the subs name. </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if some of the mods in here were doing similar things to generate more drama for making us look like knobs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is good analysis imo - anyone who has spent time here can spot the shills and detractors, and the Mod team has been acting more and more like them.  No reasons, just shadow votes and announcements, just like has happened all over reddit.  I&#39;d say &quot;head on over to voat but obviously the mod team there has a lot of crossover, and since the votes are hidden from us we have no idea if they are the same team thats participating in this, but they probably are.  I&#39;ve heard a lot of good things about Corbett&#39;s forums and there are others out there, but you have to dig.  If you&#39;re not willing to dig you probably don&#39;t belong here anyway.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t see the inherent problem with that I don&#39;t know what the fuck to tell you.  If you have an account with a history here, post on that, it gives you more clout to make changes you want to make.</p>

<p>The fact that outside, &#39;smarter-than-thou&#39; trolls are attempting to influence the sub, does <strong>not</strong> mean that any discussion about the issues surrounding the podcast, bans, and actual secret election are automatically invalid. </p>

<p>That is my point and it has been frustrating to see. </p>

<p>Want to see real outside interference? Look at the recent threads about the Monsanto employee admitting to the &#39;debunking&#39; department. You&#39;d think we were on a Monsanto-run message board. </p>

<p>It is that kind of sketchy narrative-driving that I keep seeing around this issue. Not that it&#39;s the same purpose, but the debate is just as disingenuous. </p>

<p>Why is it so ever-lovin&#39; important that Flytape is a mod?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not, this post isn&#39;t about flytape, in fact if you bothered to read the post fully you&#39;d see I said if the community wants to get rid of Flytape go for it, there just needs to be a prerequisite that they are demonstrably members of this community before their opinion is worth anything for the obvious reasons of there being a history of these other subs doing shit very similar to this to try and get control of the sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why is getting him off the mod list changing &quot;control of the sub.&quot; Half the rest of the mods are his buds. Fewer mods are always better unless there&#39;s some demonstrable value to the guy being a mod besides banning criticism. You have to understand that to a lot of us here, it appears that there&#39;s a very solid faction here pretty intent on continuing to sow drama. &quot;Trolls&quot; didn&#39;t make AATA &amp; FT do that wretched podcast. &quot;Trolls&quot; didn&#39;t make FT act like a baby and ban people who criticised him. &quot;Trolls&quot; didn&#39;t post all this hand-wringing &quot;it&#39;s all Ess Arr Dee, man. Ess Arr Dee! Fuck the subscribers, you are all sockpuppets!&quot; crud. I still don&#39;t understand why y&#39;all are on his jock so hard. And even so - he could just get another sockpuppet and everyone could vote his sockpuppet back in yet again. No need for the drama, right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The slippery slope is the reverse, they are circling the wagons to obvious and overt outside attack.</p>

<p>Once they (outside subs) can unseat 1 person under specious circumstances (I&#39;m not even saying the accusations against FT are specious I&#39;m saying the circumstance they are using as the pretext [the podcast] is specious at best).  When he arbitrarily banned Tenet and WideAWAKE was when I joined the other conspiracy regs who felt he needed to go or at least not be able to ban anymore - but the more forcefully this is pushed by these outside influences the more I become reactionary to the removal as well.</p>

<p>You want to get rid of FT, tell these meddling fucks to mind their own business and let this community handle it&#39;s own without their proverbial ballot stuffing via comments and votes.</p>

<p>Being banned for disagreeing with a mod is nuts. Having to WORRY about something like that is even more nuts. This is demonstrable proof of why mods abusing their powers need to go. It breeds distrust and degradation within the community. There are no loopholes around this, once you cross the threshold you either replace the mods who are causing problems or you watch the sub whither away as the users turn upon themselves in an attempt to find out what&#39;s really going on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I skim over drama, so let me be clear...I have no opinion of <a href="/u/flytape">/u/flytape</a> as a mod.  Having said that, the entire mod team here is lackluster and allows entirely too much shillery and fuckery.  I think half or better of them get paychecks from the letter agencies and/or are working hand in hand with the people they should be banning.  This is supposed to be a sub of free thought and expression, but every time I post here I feel anxiety because I may be the next tardget.  In 1984 people gathered and screamed hate at the enemy on the screen.  I think participating in conversation here is essentially volunteering to be on that screen.  Mods could help if they did their jobs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea same. The problem of outsiders coming to manipulate this sub will always exist. Let&#39;s keep posting our links, speaking our mind and ignore and down vote anyone with an ulterior agenda. If we get hung up over them, they win.
