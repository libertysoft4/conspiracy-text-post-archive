    <div class="md"><p>So far, you are the only one who has directly addressed the question of <em>Why does <a href="/r/conspiracy/">/r/conspiracy/</a> appear to have a Pro-Anthropogenic Climate Change bias?</em></p>

<p>For the past several weeks I have noted a large voting bias on any subjects that are critical, even superficially, of ACC.</p>

<p>This is normal throughout the Internet Social Media, so in itself, it&#39;s not surprising. But on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> of all places?</p>

<p>A subreddit that questions, parses and argues practically <em>everything</em>?</p>

<p>To be honest, that sounds like a <em>fucking</em> conspiracy to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t trust the voting anymore man, if anything it&#39;s sometimes the comments and threads that get buried which seem to have the most merit and truth in them.  I was going to say &quot;especially here on this sub&quot;, but then I thought better of it and realized it&#39;s probably <em>even worse</em> in the main subs.</p>

<p>In my opinion, it&#39;s about manufacturing a false consensus which is so incredibly easy to do on a site like this which is anonymous and relies on voting to determine what people see.  How tough would it be for you yourself to make a few fake accounts and artificially upvote each of your own comments and threads 2 or 3 points right after posting them?  And then imagine if you actually had access to software that allowed you to control 6, 7, 8 accounts at once - or a team of people with such software - and you can see how easily it would be to manipulate the discourse.</p>

<p>You can see this happening almost anytime a thread is posted on one of the more &quot;divisive&quot; subjects.  Oftentimes the top comment will have like 30+ upvotes and be negative towards the OP while most every other comment in the thread will be positive towards the OP and have 10 or less upvotes.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Anti-corporate types may skew to the opposite side by default but free-thinkers should seriously question things when the government as well many politically connected corporations start paying lip-service to a global policy agenda.  There should be some serious red flags going up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Brainwashing. If they are under 40 they have been brought up with the guilt of destroying the planet. When something is ingrained from a young age, it is very hard to overcome.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Very true, the best intentions of the true environmental movement have been hijacked for political purposes a while now. The indoctrination in government schools is so inculcated in the curriculum it can&#39;t be avoided.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because this sub is being brigaded. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If so, it is a well regulated brigade of voters. But, something is seriously awry in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> when topics are getting dv&#39;ed into obscurity by a relative few amount of voters. It doesn&#39;t take much in a busy sub like this, keep a post topic at zero for just a little bit of time and it will effectively die.  </p>

<p>I post in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> so i can interact with fellows who like to question and parse things out. </p>

<p>When my posts start attracting comments from people vehemently upholding the system or the status quo...I get suspicious because it seems to me that they are like fish out of water. </p>

<p>This is not to say I expect agreement, but this topic is a good example...</p>

<p><em>Let&#39;s Discuss: Why does <a href="/r/conspiracy/">/r/conspiracy/</a> appear to have a Pro-Anthropogenic Climate Change bias?</em></p>

<p>No. I don&#39;t need &quot;peer review&quot; papers to back up an understanding what scientists are saying in their own panel discussion:</p>

<p><a href="http://judithcurry.com/2015/02/24/naruc-panel-discussion-on-climate-change/">NARUC Panel Discussion on Climate Change</a></p>

<p>Let&#39;s get one thing straight: the sacred cow of peer review is not a universal panacea for trumping rational debate. It&#39;s simply one more man-made institution that can be prone to its own internal politics and corruption. </p>

<p>Now, yes, there are plenty of peer-reviewed papers on both sides of the argument, but one must ask: Does one side get more publicity <em>and</em> funding than the other?</p>

<p>If the answer is one &quot;side or the other&quot; then peer reviewed scholarship is not anywhere as inviolate as has been promoted by some. As a scientific currency, peer review can become corrupted. Blindly accepting the output of the process is part of the current problem facing the scientific progress of today.</p>

<p>None of that matters.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a &quot;scientist&quot;, I am a human being with a brain and the capacity for rational thinking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It just seems from my experience that there can be a pretty big gap between what people say about this issue and what they actually have evidence for.  Curry for example, sounds very different in public than she does in her actual research.  She is part of a small but vocal minority of scientists that publish work that estimates low climate sensitivity, but even her own work stands in huge contrast to the points that she presented to that panel.  Richard Lindzen is another example of a scientist who says very different things in his public occupation as a mouthpiece for conservative thinktanks than in his actual published research.</p>

<p>Judith Curry is certainly no &quot;climate change denier&quot; but she is what I term an intellectually honest person who happens to be a scientist.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what some man-made climate change advocates would have us believe. It&#39;s far more efficient to just blacklist with such broad strokes by decreeing that someone is a &quot;DENIER&quot; instead of actually dealing with or acknowledging a reasoned and validated position of dissent.</p>

<p>Just using two very recent examples of what <a href="http://judithcurry.com/">Judith Curry</a> and <a href="http://www.vancouversun.com/technology/Conversations+that+matter+Earth+actually+growing+greener/10944052/story.html">Freeman Dyson</a> have stated illustrates the intellectual failure of writing off dissenting opinions as &quot;denial-ism&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh please stop with Judith Curry, her &quot;science&quot;  had been soundly  debunked on this subreddit many times. Citing a cherry picked outlier does nothing for the discussion.</p>

<p>You can deny all you want the sun rises in the east. You can downvote it as well.  But its not gonna rise in the south tomorrow. If it does, science will change to reflect that. So far it hasnt. </p>

<p>Most climate denial is pure organized corporate astroturfing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Peter Christoff, writing an opinion piece in The Age in 2007, said that climate change denial differs from scientific skepticism, which is essential for good science. He argues:</p>

<p>&quot;Almost two decades after the issue became one of global concern, the &#39;big&#39; debate over climate change is over. There are now no credible scientific skeptics challenging the underlying scientific theory, or the broad projections, of climate change.&quot;[14]
The relationship between industry-funded denial and public climate change skepticism has been compared to earlier efforts by the tobacco industry to undermine scientific evidence on the dangers of secondhand smoke, and linked as a direct continuation of these earlier financial relationships.[20] Aside from private industry groups, climate change denial has also been alleged regarding the statements of elected officials.[21]</p>

Magnetic field weakening such as the one we experience today has been proven through geological evidence to accompany Magnetic Field Reversal.

<p>Thankfully, our visionary leaders in government are wise men who fund science, technology, exploration, and engineering... and so humans are fortunate that we possess the intelligence to consider the Long Now. Why just the other day I proposed to the Planetary Congress to place into a high orbit around the Milky Way a satellite that would transmit telemetry and astronomical data to all civilizations that may arise for billions of years. A means with which to give a leg up to any intelligence so that one day life may reach every corner of the cosmos. The Planetary Congress unanimously approved - and launch of the Trillion Year Milky Way Orbiter is expected soon. Millions and Billions of years from now, unknown civilizations will look back on humanity in awe and wonder and it is all thanks to our efforts here today. /dream</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The bad bacteria is overtaking the good. We are a long way from the mindset of the Ancients. We now live in a world where 95 percent of us have nothing and 5 percent have everything. I guarantee you this; we are nothing but in their way at this point. That&#39;s why the urgency of truth exists now. </p>

<p>I see no reason why anyone would doubt anthropogenic climate change.</p>

<p>Most people wouldn&#39;t state that they don&#39;t think people can impact climate, but there&#39;s a huge difference as to degree that humans can and do impact climate.</p>

<p>Large cities certainly cause lasting temperature changes for example.</p>

<p>However, founding a global policy on the idea that humans are the major driver of climate on earth is simply bad science and evil politics.</p>

<p>One couldn&#39;t very well send &#39;nature&#39; a bill if more blame was laid there. And there is a LOT of push back from industries that should carry more of the blame. Beef as one example.  Laying the blame with humans in general means that the &#39;bill&#39; can be <del>siphoned</del> split equally among all humans.</p>

<p>Well, we don&#39;t attempt to charge anyone for rainy days or earthquakes. Obviously such things can have economic impacts but living a life always does.</p>

<p>Climate change happens.</p>

<p>Mankind has <a href="http://r.ddmcdn.com/w_622/u_0/gif/megalith-pictures-28.jpg">witnessed it</a> throughout <a href="http://images.bwbx.io/cms/2013-06-14/0614-italian-harbor-630x420.jpg">history</a>. Vast expanses of land once inhabited lies <a href="http://s1.hubimg.com/u/2952248_f520.jpg">submerged</a> resulting in massive amounts of hidden human history withing to be <a href="https://www.eeb.ucla.edu/Faculty/Barber/SundaSeaLevels.htm">discovered</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Any computer model for the environment must have at its basis an extremely complex multivariable differential equation with an outrageous number of variables. Computer programs rely on math. This is how you have things like the Butterfly Effect and Chaos Theory. Climate modelers must first mathematically propose - using logic - a mathematical proof that a multivariable equation containing multiple unknowns can be solved. Their mathematical models most often times do not even have an existence theorem for which an answer can be outputted.</p>

<p>Local climate change can definitely be attributed to man - but evidence for global warming is nonexistant. When I see Environmentalists proposing a draft to the Army Corp of Engineers with the purpose of massive reforestation I will happily join them. When they make proposals to construct coastal reefs, clean up pollution, recycle, etc - I have been signing those petitions since Kindergarten; massive changes in wind currents caused by removing mountajns, building new mountains called skyscrapers, asphalt, reflectivity of cities - are all examples of anthropogenic climate change. As far as CO2 goes, CO2 levels are far too low for Biosphere restoration. This planet needs about a trillion more trees, a massive reforestatio project and to restore countless of animals from that brink of extinction. Humans can affect climate - unfortunately - current plans focusing on CO2 regulation do not address the actual issues.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, good points but...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Free thinkers are by definition anti-establishment. If they see corporations supporting one side of an issue they will migrate in the other direction. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anti-corporate types may skew to the opposite side by default but free-thinkers should seriously question things when the government as well many politically connected corporations start paying lip-service to a global policy agenda.  There should be some serious red flags going up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Brainwashing. If they are under 40 they have been brought up with the guilt of destroying the planet. When something is ingrained from a young age, it is very hard to overcome.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Very true, the best intentions of the true environmental movement have been hijacked for political purposes a while now. The indoctrination in government schools is so inculcated in the curriculum it can&#39;t be avoided.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because this sub is being brigaded. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If so, it is a well regulated brigade of voters. But, something is seriously awry in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> when topics are getting dv&#39;ed into obscurity by a relative few amount of voters. It doesn&#39;t take much in a busy sub like this, keep a post topic at zero for just a little bit of time and it will effectively die.  </p>

<p>I post in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> so i can interact with fellows who like to question and parse things out. </p>

<p>When my posts start attracting comments from people vehemently upholding the system or the status quo...I get suspicious because it seems to me that they are like fish out of water. </p>

<p>This is not to say I expect agreement, but this topic is a good example...</p>

<p><em>Let&#39;s Discuss: Why does <a href="/r/conspiracy/">/r/conspiracy/</a> appear to have a Pro-Anthropogenic Climate Change bias?</em></p>

<p>There&#39;s something seriously wrong.</p>
