<p>We realize that there are a select few subscribers here that will be vehemently against this move but we feel that it&#39;s best for the entirety of the sub in light of the value he brings to the mod team and in spite of his penchant for inciting controversy. He has a unique ability to spot the embedded detractors of this sub and spends a lot of time in other subs as a means to that end.</p>

<p>Please consider this post a free-for-all. This will be an absolute free speech thread. Say anything you like. NO RULES WILL BE ENFORCED (except <a href="http://www.reddit.com/rules">Reddit&#39;s sitewide rules</a> of course).</p>

<p>So, if you have anything to say about it say it here and now. Then we&#39;re going to move on and continue to try to make this sub what it was intended to be... discussions about conspiracies, actual or theoretical, real or imagined and, as always, controversial.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who knows and who cares? Man I have become the poster child for zoloft when talking about reddit. I deal with lego more. Its the only real topic and sub I care enough about to have a view I will defend if challenged </p>

<p>Mainly cause for the most part its a good sub with good people. Plus playing lego with my (6) years old tommrow son is a fucking blast. Debating the inner workings of reddit or bitching about a person that wants to become a mod for free really isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>This sub is full of hate and fucked upness lol. So many are quick to call you a shill or worse as soon as you don&#39;t agree with them. You post a link to defend your view and its from a shit site with no creditability to them.</p>

<p>The user base of this sub is what killed it. Not the mods. It was all the people that started posting shit about current news topics that devolved this sub. Used to be like an art bell coast to coast episode in here. I liked that. Then it became like an episode of Rush. </p>

<p>If you participated in the circle jerk you became accepted. I was sucked in too. Then I saw the truth one day and all this sub was about. </p>

<p>Its all a lie. They want you to be upset so you create more content. Happy people don&#39;t make for good posters. Everyone wants drama so they can think to them self that they are better then that. Truth is we are not. </p>

<p>Not a fucking one of us on this planet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is my two cents. I felt mr_dong made the appropriate decision after Flytape swung the ban hammer out of spite. I do not think a mod that compromises his ethics of censorship over petty insults should remain a mod. Sorry Fly, but that&#39;s my opinion.</p>

<p>However, I do believe that Flytape should be given an opportunity to make his defense, and let the community decide whether he stays or goes. In an open vote.</p>

<p>By open I mean with Yays and Nays, not upvotes. In order for your vote to count you must comment Yay or Nay. In effort to limit trolls, socks, and Tards I suggest we come up with voter standards. My suggestion would be that they must be a contributor (comment or post). Have a minimum account age of at least 3 months, and of course no posts history to anti-conspiracy sub-reddits.</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>In my opinion, the huge problem before us here is - now no matter how great Flytape is, he is tainted with so many scandals just having him as a mod creates massive disruption in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</strong> (as we can all see with our own eyes over the past few days with numerous threads and thousands of comments dedicated to this debacle)</p>

<p>Let&#39;s do a summary/ELI5</p>

<p>1) <strong>An &quot;official podcast&quot; was released on Friday night by AssuredlyAThrowAway and the first guest was Flytape</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>He was wearing a weird mask</li>
<li>He was smoking a vape-pen</li>
<li>He had a trippy shifting background animation</li>
<li>The Podcast lasted a few hours</li>
</ul>

<p>2) <strong>Flytape bans people who are in uproar about this performance</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>The users were mad because no one consulted with them properly and timely before the announcement of the podcast</p></li>
<li><p>They were mad that the podcast was being used as an &quot;official&quot; representation of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> by AssuredlyAThrowAway on YouTube</p></li>
<li><p>They thought Flytape was pushing hitler memes</p></li>
</ul>

<p>3) <strong>Mr_dong comes in later due to UK timezone differential and removes the Podcast sticky due to the community uproar</strong></p>

<p>4) <strong>The story feed has multiple threads blowing up discussing the incident</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>SRD crossposts the thread and it goes viral </li>
<li>memes are created by users on reddit &quot;justconspiracythings&quot; with flytape&#39;s mask/vape-pen</li>
</ul>

<p>5) <strong>Mr_dong comes back with an announcement that countless users have complained about the situation and he looked into it more.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>He finds that the podcast should not have been &quot;official&quot; </p></li>
<li><p>He finds that Flytape was banning people who did nothing wrong</p></li>
<li><p>He finds that the conflict is so divisive that the only way to resolve it is to remove Flytape for the overall community&#39;s benefit, even though some mods disagreed.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>6) <strong>The next day Flytape posts an apology thread</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>He magically appears on mod list again</li>
<li>He deletes his thread after a poor response by subscribers </li>
<li>People start posting about the deleted thread and reinstatement</li>
</ul>

<p>7) <strong>SovereignMan posts an announcement thread</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The mods had a vote behind the scenes </li>
<li>It was an 80% - 20% victory for flytape</li>
<li>The votes will be kept in secret</li>
</ul>

<p>8) <strong><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> explodes in dissent</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Multiple threads with hundreds of combined comments</li>
<li>People accusing others of being shills from SRD with no evidence</li>
<li>People asking for transparency in the vote</li>
<li>People complaining that Flytape abused his powers too many times</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>No matter how great Flytape is or can be, he is tainted with so many scandals just having him as a mod creates massive disruption in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</strong></p>

<p>This isn&#39;t his first chance, right???</p>

<p>But that&#39;s just my observation. </p>

Noone can really. Politics at every level is an eternal struggle .  Everyone has their own personal feelings,  agendas,  bias etc.  One thing I&#39;ve learned is to take each comment on its own merit.  For every Jim cole,  there&#39;s a rockran or drytruth.

    <div class="md"><p>Not only do I agree with the critiques that you have made previously, I fully commend your insight into this problem. I believe that everyone who frequents this sub and contributes, should have the ability to vote on the moderators, hold elections, through a democratic process, majority winning. </p>

<p>Even though this is not necessarily the best form of voting as there will always be a dissenting opinion (see John Jacques Rousseau on democracy in the Social Contract). I do believe it is the best for the community to have their voices be heard, whether in favor or against.</p>

<p>I am not here to attack any mod or other members, but to voice my opinion that we should keep &quot;power positions&quot; in rotation. Let other hardworking contributors also get chance to mod this sub. This will keep everything balanced and  hopefully unnecessary extremism can be avoided.</p>

<p>That may be true, but my point is that he&#39;s <em>lying</em> (or is misinformed) and people are still listening.</p>

<p>For a sub devoted to uncovering the truth, as you say, this is the first huge red flag.</p>

<p>Can you tell me how many people were involved in the vote for Flytape&#39;s reinstatement? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What I can tell you is that I&#39;m a little confused as to where the 80%-20% came from. Even mr_dong didn&#39;t object to Flytape&#39;s return. As far as I could tell, no mods unequivocally voted against it, although some expressed hesitance.</p>

<p>Also, we have a few largely inactive mods, so obviously they didn&#39;t participate.</p>

<p>Essentially, all the mods that actively participate in this sub supported this decision.</p>

<p>This is kind of exactly what the guy is talking about. You don&#39;t really seem to be looking at it from a sub perspective, only a mod perspective.</p>

<p>You think the huge red flag is a possibly misinformed person, when the INSANELY MASSIVE red flag is that a huge percentage of people here have lost confidence and trust in the moderation team.</p>

<p>Thats the difference between a mod and a sub. </p>

<p>The worst part is that most people only lost confidence in 1 person, but now we&#39;ve lost it in the whole team for the way they handled that 1 person.</p>

<p>Not that I&#39;m guessing it matters, we all know from past experience the subs don&#39;t really matter here. You guys have shown you can do as you want, it&#39;ll blow over each time with only a slightly heavier buildup from the last time carrying over.</p>

<p>Does content also mean nothing to you? As a moderator I would have thought that maybe you&#39;d have the logic to realize content is more important.</p>

<p>Some of us talk about things here we don&#39;t want tied to us for our own safety. Thus new accounts afford us such safety. </p>

<p>It isn&#39;t about the technical quality, it&#39;s the content.</p>

<p>I&#39;d watch a 5 hour vid of Slavoj Zizek in moonlanding quality if the content is interesting as is always the case with Zizek, but Flytape is making one cringe up to a point where one does not expect more cringing ever even remotely possible. </p>

<p>Well done, it&#39;s a classic already.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Damnit man you making me think. </p>

<p>Money comes from control. Or lack their of at the time it was created. Value in elements or whatever when in practicality they are of little to no use. Take diamonds. </p>

<p>What can you do with a diamond? Or gold. What can you do with it?</p>

<p>Both are useless to man. But somehow it became valuable because of its scarcity. Not because of its use. Well not diamonds they are not rare really. So what someone can cut it to make it sparkly.</p>

<p>I know a place that makes the best tiramsu and that is way more useful then a fucking diamond.</p>

<p>Money comes from control.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But did the control come first or did the money?  I&#39;ve always pondered this myself.</p>

<p>In other words, was there a group of people who controlled another group of people for some <em>other</em> reason and then realized that money would be a way to accomplish the same thing with far less effort and far greater reward?  Or did the money come first and a select group somehow take ownership over it and use it to dominate the rest of the people?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What can you do with a diamond? Or gold. What can you do with it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well a diamond is used in tool building because of its hardness.</p>

<p>Gold is malleable, relatively rare, maintains its composition (never rusts) even after <em>thousands and thousands</em> of years, is fairly heavy and difficult to traffic, etc.  So they actually do have <em>some</em> intrinsic value or you can at least see why they might be valued - gold has been used in trading for thousands of years.</p>

<p>For diamonds, the argument becomes more questionable because &quot;diamonds are a girl&#39;s best friend&quot; and all that BS was invented in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Beers">19th and 20th centuries.</a></p>

<p>I do agree with this though to some extent, and can see how the idea of money (i.e.: store of value) could be useful.  The issue has come with this new idea of debt-based fiat, where every dollar made creates more than a dollar in debt - it&#39;s totally unsustainable.</p>

<p>And, almost certainly worst of all, the huge majority of it is held and controlled by an incredibly small number of actual people. </p>

<p>Hmm, more interesting question.  My answer would be that it&#39;s always been mostly used for trade, and in that way I could see it used effectively in the future - for instance currency backed by gold (as it has been for hundreds, in some cases thousands of years).</p>

<p>But what we have now isn&#39;t that.  What we have now is debt owned by a small number of people who use it to siphon actual wealth from everyone else.</p>

<p>Exactly my point. We as individuals have no use business and industry do. So its a system for us to gather it and them to buy it. Kinda like when the devil says your soul isnt worth anything then you would say they why do you want it so bad.</p>

Dress him down but by the explanation of the mod team I get it.  We know fly tapes foibles.  He is on watch.  Of any community we know what the answer should be to who watches the watchmen?  The watched do.  That is the only answer.  From there I would strongly argue better the devil you know.  He should be dressed down severely, and maybe even have a dedicated mod to review his mod actions on occasion, remove a few privileges if possible would be great.

    <div class="md"><p>No matter my opinion on the matter, I think he cant be a good mod, even if he wanted to.  At this point in time flytape cant post without people downvoting just because who he is.   He can not effectively be a moderator when the community hates him and he hates much of the community.   The right thing for him to do would be to step down.  Just look at all his recent post, he is downvoted before his comments are even given thought (not saying this is right just making a point).</p>

<p>There are basically two types of users in this sub(those who comment and those who just skim and vote) and he doesn&#39;t have very many fans in either camp as this thread proves.  Just look at all the hate and general downvotes.  At this point he just cant be effective as a mod.  Too much contempt going both ways between the community and the him  (unless the European crowd just love him and things change in 12 hours lol).  And the further this situation drags out the more distrust builds for the other moderators who gave him back his powers. </p>

<p>Until their community ups and leaves because they are sick of the abuse.  Or worse children get all worked up and next thing you know people are getting DDoSed. Imagine if 10 or 20 butthurt users got together and decided to hurt this community because the moderators do not care about the will of the community.  </p>

<p>Imagine what would happen to the face of this sub if the new queue was manipulated by these said people?  The new queue is literally the lifeblood of this community since most people just look at the hot tab.   These users could easily control what hits the hot queue by manipulating the new queue.  Only posts with 10-15 upvotes even make it to the hot queue so they could keep everything they want suppressed downvoted while upvoting garbage filler.  Imagine those users manipulating the hot queue so its all anti-semite, radical home grown terrorist type posts; people would start unsubbing like crazy, reddit would go crazy with drama.  It wouldn&#39;t be the end of the sub, but damage could be done easily. </p>

<p>My point is the mods are only as powerful as their community allows them to be.  Its probably like the whole politics in the US thing though and most people don&#39;t give a fuck. This leads to small groups of people being able to manipulate the system (im talking both politics and reddit lol), so is that a good thing? and does any of this even really matter?  since the small group currently in control is the moderators and they are clearly doing what they feel is right and not asking for the communities input, and the community is content.  Wow this is really a mirror of politics in general.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Currently our mod ding team is decent at stopping people who attempt to manipulate the queue now.  So.  If we are effective now as much as I think is reasonable, and by introducing new mods we introduce more people with potential agendas that actually are out to discredit this sub, such a person could contrive events far worse than an emotional ban or twelve from a mod to discredit and &#39;&#39;destroy&#39;&#39; this sub.</p>

<p>People who manipulate like that tend to get the banhammer, that is the whole point.  No it is not a democracy, it&#39;s a forum with a list of rules, first few years online?  I learned this shit in the 90s.  But guess what, organic from a small number and carefully you can manta in pretty sane and stable online communities.  The fact there is no &#39;&#39;head mod&#39;&#39; actually makes this one of the absolute most democratic social grouping systems I have used online.   Corruption happens, weird people happen, that is humanity. Any change in the people in charge is a roll of the dice.  So we rolled a 17 on the nodding of this sub so far.  Care to speed up the timeline until we need to roll again by witch hunting dedicated mods that have been around forever?</p>

<p>mr_dong removed him for abusing power and then the next day there was a secret vote by mods and they reinstated him without any announcement. Flytape&#39;s thread was deleted but luckily the community forced them to sticky an official announcement about their secret vote. </p>

<p>Why does it matter what they do. If they ban you come back with a new name change your narritve and say it again. </p>

<p>Do you have any idea who flytape or anyone else that mods here? Do you know them as a person. They act different then they do IRL I bet. Probably a group you would let come over and fuck your sister if you have one.</p>

<p>Point is that realize reddit is entertainment. It isn&#39;t something that should matter to you or anyone else. Be you and don&#39;t worry about acceptance for your own ideas and values. </p>

<p>Looks like even mr_dong removed a few of your comments lately, including this one:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am the guy who is going to follow you around and downvote you on every sub because you posted fiction to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and this lovely one:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t really care where you post it, because it&#39;s crap. Do not post it here, because it&#39;s crap.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not an issue that you can&#39;t find any place to post this. It is a problem that you posted it here. I will be watching your posts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;re basically an idiot with denialist blogs that lack references as your sources. Open your eyes, dummy.</p>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is false. The reason I write &quot;false&quot; on your posts is that you are a liar with an agenda.</p>

<p>and:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It gets exhausting dealing with people at your level, which is low like the floor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s just after browsing your comments for 10 seconds.</p>

<p>You&#39;re the type of user that makes the rest of the sub look bad, and you&#39;re also the type that will likely eventually be banned for resorting to puerile insults instead of engaging in rational discussion.</p>

<p>Bwahahah.  If those upvotes are &quot;suspicious&quot; it&#39;s because you don&#39;t like them.  That&#39;s remarkable, that you turn an actual consensus into a fantasy conspiracy.</p>

<p>As for my comment history, look at the context.  If it&#39;s crap that belongs in a sci-fi subreddit, I say so quite firmly.  I was correct in every case.  The truth is, I should be a moderator here -- and apparently you shouldn&#39;t.</p>

<p>This sub is full of ridiculous nonsense, and would be nicely served by moderators who did something about that.  As things stand, if it weren&#39;t for rude subscribers, there would be no negative feedback to the remarkably crazy posters that wander through.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is exactly the kind of ridiculous f* **** attitude that makes me side with fly tape axoytlyl and the 80 percent.  This sub is not the place to &#39;&#39;filter nonsense&#39;&#39; and it never has been.  </p>

<p>This sub is Camelot from Monty python.  It is a truly silly place, but that is, in my opinion it&#39;s value.  Cruise through and ignore the stuff you think is garbage, don&#39;t go in the comments.  If you do you could find the thread that agrees with your logic and assessments and understanding and work constructively off that, rather than having a mind to dig up the entire garden to make more space for YOUR specific favourite flower.  </p>

<p>Really, your personality is more prone to power abuses than fly tapes seeming ideology which is to push his ideas out whilst also tending the garden.  </p>

<p>Fly tape should stay if only to ward off the necessity of needing to bring more mods on again and risking having someone like YOU &#39;&#39;infiltrating the modding clique&#39;&#39; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>... no it really makes perfect sense to me the happenings as you call them in that context.  Some may indeed have nefarious agendas, but flytapes personality and motives fit better with an idealist who can be dragged down emotionally to making mistakes.  That is a flaw common to idealists of any stripe, and many pragmatists and others as well.  I don&#39;t see his actions totalling to a nefarious plot, quite the opposite.  I have viewed flytape as a known quantity for a while now.  One that I don&#39;t see as always agreeable on the topics he supports, but he is not misaligned with the spirit of this sub. </p>

<p>and </p>

<p>I don&#39;t really care where you post it, because it&#39;s crap. Do not post it here, because it&#39;s crap. 
It&#39;s not an issue that you can&#39;t find any place to post this. It is a problem that you posted it here. I will be watching your posts.</p>

<p>They are in response to this post:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/30zyn2/andromeda_council_sonic_beam_destroys_reptilian/">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/30zyn2/andromeda_council_sonic_beam_destroys_reptilian/</a></p>

<p>Frankly, this is an obvious case in which I am right and the moderation in this sub is wrong.  Posts such as that which got me riled up should be deleted for being ridiculously insane.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a shame Mr. Dong thought it was a problem that I was giving <a href="/u/thegr8rambino13">/u/thegr8rambino13</a> grief.  If I were the mod, that user would be banned for such a post, and I would be given a pat on the back.</p>

<p>You are doing it wrong, and the upvotes to my comments are evidence of that.  You can call them &quot;suspicious&quot; and make yourself look retarded, it doesn&#39;t change the fact that apparently many subscribers agree with me that you&#39;re doing it wrong.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t have many subscribers to the ones you listed cause the legosales one was created by someone everyone hated more then me. He and I get along.</p>

<p>The legocharity one is new. We don&#39;t really have many people asking for lego. If we did then we would help as many as we could.</p>

<p>Now the secret one is very important. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He has been and gone 3 times now since I have been on reddit. The inconsistencies with reasons is fucking retarded. Just leave him or fucking don&#39;t. You other mods will do whatever you please anyways.</p>

<p>The podcast, fucking up an iama, and reinstating a mod. This isn&#39;t a democracy. This is you telling us what you are going to do any fucking way.</p>

<p>Personally flytape has never done me wrong. I like the guy. So what about his views. Didn&#39;t like the podcast when they were saying it was the oppion of the user base in this sub. Oh well he learned from that I hope.</p>

<p>Just do what you want mods its clearly a totalitarian system on reddit. Admin, mods, and others are using this site as a platform to further their own agendas. You all are no different.</p>

<p>Its for entertainment people let let it be that. There never was nor will there ever be free speech on reddit. You can&#39;t say what you want without being criticized. So to hell with dreaming about it. Accept you won&#39;t have it and vow to change the status quo or let it continue.</p>

<p>Moving to whoaverse or voat... Whatever akto wants to call it. Won&#39;t change these people are going to he there too. Be an adult and say fuckem. They do this to encourage you so you will post more. Therefore making more content for free.</p>

<p>It all generates revenue for reddit. Realize that your time is their money. So if it is something you are going to say to a user then send them a message instead. Make reddit completely bare of content.</p>

<p>Really make the difference and fuck them up. You won&#39;t do that cause you can&#39;t. You mind wants you to defend yourself. </p>

<p>Just try it and see what happens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me get this straight </p>

<p>1) <strong>An &quot;official podcast&quot; was released on Friday night by AssuredlyAThrowAway and the first guest was Flytape</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>He was wearing a weird mask</li>
<li>He was smoking a vape-pen</li>
<li>He had a trippy shifting background animation</li>
<li>The Podcast lasted a few hours</li>
</ul>

<p>2) <strong>Flytape bans people who are in uproar about this performance</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>The users were mad because no one consulted with them properly and timely before the announcement of the podcast</p></li>
<li><p>They were mad that the podcast was being used as an &quot;official&quot; representation of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> by AssuredlyAThrowAway on YouTube</p></li>
<li><p>They thought Flytape was pushing hitler memes</p></li>
</ul>

<p>3) <strong>Mr_dong comes in later due to UK timezone differential and removes the Podcast sticky due to the community uproar</strong></p>

<p>4) <strong>The story feed has multiple threads blowing up discussing the incident</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>SRD crossposts the thread and it goes viral </li>
<li>memes are created by users on reddit &quot;justconspiracythings&quot; with flytape&#39;s mask/vape-pen</li>
</ul>

<p>5) <strong>Mr_dong comes back with an announcement that countless users have complained about the situation and he looked into it more.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>He finds that the podcast should not have been &quot;official&quot; </p></li>
<li><p>He finds that Flytape was banning people who did nothing wrong</p></li>
<li><p>He finds that the conflict is so divisive that the only way to resolve it is to remove Flytape for the overall community&#39;s benefit, even though some mods disagreed.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>6) <strong>The next day Flytape posts an apology thread</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>He magically appears on mod list again</li>
<li>He deletes his thread after a poor response by subscribers </li>
<li>People start posting about the deleted thread and reinstatement</li>
</ul>

<p>7) <strong>SovereignMan posts an announcement thread</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The mods had a vote behind the scenes </li>
<li>It was an 80% - 20% victory for flytape</li>
<li>The votes will be kept in secret</li>
</ul>

<p>8) <strong><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> explodes in dissent</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Multiple threads with hundreds of combined comments</li>
<li>People accusing others of being shills from SRD with no evidence</li>
<li>People asking for transparency in the vote</li>
<li>People complaining that Flytape abused his powers too many times</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>In my opinion, the huge problem before us here is - now no matter how great Flytape is, he is tainted with so many scandals just having him as a mod creates massive disruption in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.  This alone should result in removal from moderation powers + the fact that he abused his powers by banning people for no reason</strong></p>

<p>This isn&#39;t his first chance, right?</p>

<p>But that&#39;s just my observation. </p>

<p>...Holy shit this is <strong>THREE HOURS LONG</strong>. I hate to say this but it&#39;s pretty much as bad as people say it is. Lol wow. Guys nobody here is interested in <strong>THREE HOURS</strong> of subreddit drama. </p>

<p>They could have at least talked about their favorite conspiracies or something? Maybe they did, but I didn&#39;t listen to all <strong>THREE HOURS</strong> of it. </p>

<p>Unverifiable as a fact and untestable as a hypothesis.  If he is the only one who can tell, how can other mods concur?  How is it known that he is correct if there is no alternative metric other than his opinion?</p>

<p>Did the rest of the mod team actually believe this when they told themselves it or is there perhaps another reason for keeping him such as the amount of time he dedicates to detractors rather than some special powers which make him better at it?</p>

<p>The subs here have no power, nothing you can do to the mods here. They will walk all over you because they simply have all power, and you have zero.</p>

<p>Zero.</p>

<p>Just watch. There will be another flytape incident in a month, the mods will mock all of you again, and spit in your face again. </p>

<p>Then it&#39;ll happen again a month from then again....the same as it&#39;s happened for the last year.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only way it will change is if someone takes reddit to court over false advertising.  Free speech is not protected, but the all mighty dollar is.  If some one organizes everyone who has spent money here via reddit gold, ad space, or purchaed based on the ads here, than that might get thier attention.</p>

<p>Reddit on their wiki page boasts about the &quot;culture of free speech&quot; and what they built their user base on said enviornment, (or valuable list of potential buyers that draws money from advertisers.)</p>

<p>The fact they have put a disclaimer on this  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It appears to me that some outsiders are using a video that was made (unfortunately using sub &quot;cred&quot; without sub approval) as an excuse to cause disruption and general havoc.  Many people slamming <a href="/u/flytape">/u/flytape</a> have recently-created accounts, although there are a few here who seem to harbor a grudge against him for being quick to draw his ban-hammer; I would probably be pissed about that if it happened to me, and depending on the circumstances, I might carry a grudge myself.  However, I don&#39;t see the video as an impeachable act.  If it hadn&#39;t been attached to the sub, none of this bee ess would&#39;ve gotten traction.  No biggie.  Just don&#39;t release another vid in our name w/o our approval (and we&#39;ve already been assured that won&#39;t happen).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But don&#39;t worry, your little account is safe, you protected it with your cowardice. (comment removed by a <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mod)</p>

<p>About someone who made a cake for their 2 year old:</p>

<p>If somebody gave me that cake I&#39;d probably kill myself.</p>

<p>and:</p>

<p>and:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not a conspiracy theorist.</p>

<p>Curious, what do you think the room Flytape was broadcasting from smells like? I&#39;m thinking stale french fries and foot sweat. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;ve contributed nothing of value, whatsoever, to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>It baffles me why your opinion matters on this subject, and it&#39;s equally suspicious that you&#39;re writing multiple insulting comments, with no substance, and you&#39;re getting upvoted.</p>

<p>Shameful, folks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So let me get this straight. </p>

<p>A sub that has dedicated sites whose sole purposes are disruption and ridicule suddenly cares that there is a controversy?</p>

<p>Here is what I want from the Mods--
-An environment where I can discuss topics of interest. A place where anything against the mainstream will not immediately down voted to oblivion. 
-I do not want to read the press release put out by the very offending party stated and reinforced as fact. 
-I do not want the best, most engaging comments down voted so they cannot be seen. </p>

<p>I can get the alternative, what this place is turning into, literally anywhere. I do not care what Flytape did and honestly I don&#39;t care if he is a Mod or not as long as he does his job. His job is to make r/Conspiracy a place for Conspiracies. </p>

<p>Now watch as the offending groups down vote this and continue to execute the &#39;Divide and Conquer&#39; strategy to perfection. </p>

<p>Makes you wonder what someone can do when they are on a payroll.</p>

No one in the community wanted him back, no where will you find a thread on this community where peoople are begging for his reinstatement.  He is abusive, and is gonna continue to abuse like he does EVERYTIME he is reinstated he abuses EVERYTIME.  Yet the moderators keep bringing him back why?  If this was the first time it happened this wouldn&#39;t be a big deal, but he is a racist fascist who constantly abuses his powers as moderator.   Just look threw his post history, should a moderator of a community attack members of said community?  Or should they act like an adult and not throw tantrums like children?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wrote a message to the mods giving them some honest feedback from the perspective of someone who has experience in audio/visual production. </p>

<p>Maybe someone here is interested in reading it -- does anyone else here agree that expanding the media presence of this sub is a great idea? Just because <a href="/u/flytape">/u/flytape</a> and <a href="/u/assuredlyathrowaway">/u/assuredlyathrowaway</a> fucked it up doesn&#39;t mean it shouldn&#39;t be pursued. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>For what it&#39;s worth I&#39;ve been around under many names for many years.
So I actually really liked the idea of having a podcast series run by power users or mods -- whether it&#39;s &#39;officially sanctioned&#39; or not. <a href="/u/AssuredlyAThrowAway">/u/AssuredlyAThrowAway</a> made the point that he was just trying to expand the media presence of this sub -- which is fair. And it is a good idea: imagine, for example, capitalizing on <a href="/u/axolotl_peyotl">/u/axolotl_peyotl</a>&#39;s knowledge and research and presenting it in a multimedia format that reaches an audience of thousands.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the real shit. Do any of you guys have a background in marketing or audio/visual production? I do and would gladly assist any way I can if you guys decide to pursue something like this in the future. We have the talent and the means to create compelling content -- have you guys ever seriously considered creating a sanctioned YouTube channel?</p>

<p>Anyway you guys see where you went wrong, right? Speaking specifically to <a href="/u/flytape">/u/flytape</a> and <a href="/u/AssuredlyAThrowAway">/u/AssuredlyAThrowAway</a>: You made a <strong>THREE HOUR LONG</strong> podcast about subreddit drama and <a href="/u/flytape">/u/flytape</a>&#39;s related anecdotes. That is not compelling content.</p>

<p>If your content had been interesting then the users would have forgiven you for your atrocious presentation. But it&#39;s just bad. Even for an alpha. Don&#39;t be fucking lazy. Seriously. I wouldn&#39;t turn this shit into a high school level media production class and expect to pass. Would you?</p>

<p>It&#39;s kind of astounding that you guys didn&#39;t pursue advice from your circle before publishing this -- let alone as a sticky and an &#39;official&#39; podcast. I assume you didn&#39;t because any half-impartial observer would have told you that you&#39;re out of your mind, scrap it and come up with something better. Maybe your mistake was born from arrogance and the unilateral actions you took?</p>

<p>Something better could have been easily achieved. Just scrap the creepy, stupid, blurry ass mask/background combination and replace it with something sensible -- even a black screen with text would be preferable. Then, shorten it to about 45 minutes to an hour, because this is a test run for a podcast, not a fucking <strong>SEMINAR</strong>. Finally, talk about something interesting or compelling related to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. Do you know how many big stories have launched from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and gone viral? How about the SLC Daycare story? That weird video of those two kids who claimed satanic ritual abuse? What are your thoughts on police brutality? On the holocaust? Any cool new conspiracies you&#39;ve been reading about? What&#39;s your favorite conspiracy? Do you believe in aliens?
Any of those subjects would have worked, but instead you guys jerked each other off for 3 hours and nobody wants to see that.</p>

<p>Are any of you willing to do something like this again? If you are -- and you really should -- then it needs to be done right. I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only person who has experience in this field and could help you guys put together something compelling.</p>

<p><strong>Why not make a sticky thread and ask the community about their thoughts on this sub expanding its media presence?</strong> Maybe casually poll for some talent or willing contributors? Would be a great way to reengage the community on a positive note, instead of leaving hanging on this fiasco.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This isn&#39;t about the podcast.  Flytape has been abusing his powers as a moderator by banning people for simply disagreeing with him.  It is about whether or not the community whats to continued to be attacked by a fascist bigot.  No one in the community was asking for flytape back.  The moderators did it to further their own agenda. </p>

Because it is clear your not here to have an actual discussion, your not even comprehending the posts your replying to.

Anyone can look at flytapes post history and see he calls the members of this sub everything from bitches to brats.    You have done nothing but attack anyone who disagrees with you or flytape, why is that?  Why are you detracting from the point of moderator abuse and trying to make it about a podcast? </p>

<li><p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/31fl7t/psa_for_rconspiracy_last_night_a_controversial/cq1itd3">One called Flytape a Nazi propagandist</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/31folf/uflytape_is_a_member_of_a_secret_4chan_pedophile/cq16xhk">One has been trolling /r/Conspiracy for the past 3 months and accused Flytape of being obsessed with Hitler</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If you can&#39;t follow the rules here then don&#39;t complain about the consequences and don&#39;t lie about the circumstances of your bans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i really am confused by the outcry here on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> about this &quot;moderator&quot; being &quot;reinstated&quot;...</p>

<p>lets run thru the checklist of the events at hand as i understand them:</p>

<p>the so-called &quot;flytape&quot; did something that pissed someone off...check</p>

<p>this person may have/did break stated rules that have been in effect for a long time...check</p>

<p>this person is abusive, manipulative, is a little tyrant in his/her capacity as a reddit functionary...check</p>

<p>other reddit &quot;mods&quot; voted him back in, despite the aforementioned facts...check</p>

<p>question...why does any of this surprise any of you people?  its typical bullshit that goes on everyday everywhere in the world  with people in positions of power - even in a trite, meaningless power position like this &quot;flytape&quot; individual - lie, cheat, conspire, manipulate, rig games/votes to get ahead, and <strong>they get away with it!</strong></p>

<p>to wit...hillary clinton destroyed federal government documents contrary to black letter law and policy, and will never see the inside of a courtroom for it!</p>

<p>barack obama and eric holder intentionally allowed assault rifles to be sold to mexican narcoterrorists in a nefarious effort to destroy FFL holders&#39; ability to sell to american citizens!</p>

<p>a major faction of british government and english elites have been engaging in an apparently industrialized kiddie raping operation, and they have been aided and abetted by other powerful people!</p>

<p>why does this ridiculous flytape crap surprise any of you?  as a whole, folks on this subreddit dont seem to be that naive, but the amplitude of the hue and cry here about this moronic situation amazes me.</p>

<p>a goofy website like reddit is not immune from any of this horseshit...if anything, it is more prone to it because you have simpletons and half-wits who arent smart enough to gain manipulative power, so they end up as a &quot;mod&quot; on some trivial website.</p>

<p>i think you guys need to re-evaluate your priorities with this whole thing.</p>

<p>the mods of random popular subs are super-weird. They have their own motivations for organizing the blood and snot that sticks. I&#39;d say a defining attribute of these fellas is that they just can&#39;t let shit go.</p>

<p>They, from time to time, say to themselves in the quiet of their mind that they moderate a section of the internet. The same way someone might say they run their local boys and girls club or animal shelter. they say it like they&#39;re a positive contributor to a community. </p>

<p>tomorrow I&#39;ll wake up. do some laundry. clean my bathroom. but while I do that some mod will think that he has influence in my life. </p>

<p>you can&#39;t actually prevent me from thinking what i think. you can delete comments but i can repost them. you can delete accounts but i can remake them. you can get admins to ban/poison my IP but i know what tor is and other services/programs/tricks. </p>

<p>mods can&#39;t truly moderate anything. I wonder how many of them know this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Technique #6 - &#39;GAINING FULL CONTROL&#39;</p>

<p>It is important to also be harvesting and continually maneuvering for a forum moderator position. Once this position is obtained, the forum can then be effectively and quietly controlled by deleting unfavourable postings - and one can eventually steer the forum into complete failure and lack of interest by the general public. This is the &#39;ultimate victory&#39; as the forum is no longer participated with by the general public and no longer useful in maintaining their freedoms. Depending on the level of control you can obtain, you can deliberately steer a forum into defeat by censoring postings, deleting memberships, flooding, and or accidentally taking the forum offline. By this method the forum can be quickly killed. However it is not always in the interest to kill a forum as it can be converted into a &#39;honey pot&#39; gathering center to collect and misdirect newcomers and from this point be completely used for your control for your agenda purposes.</p>

Somebody must still be paid to watch us, if just to make sure we don&#39;t have too much influence on the Reddit community because of pariahs economic impact to investors or because the government did get pissed we called out their fake events.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I hope he shapes up and asks the other mods before going on a tangent of self willed idiocrisy. Now i think a podcast would be great if the entire mod team put it together and it was not a goddamn video cast, you know since a podcast does not ever contain video...Does not even compute why it was called a podcast.. Anyways I am not sure about this decision but time will tell. </p>

<p>Flytape is disliked across reddit - just use a search engine and you&#39;ll see his absurd track record. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So firstly this threads comment section is mostly a complete clusterfuck of derogatory comments posted by users I have never seen here before. </p>

<p>Secondly I think voting on this is a better way of sorting this out than an instant ban regardless of the actions causing it. Flytape has always been fair to me and while he obviously feels strongly about certain things I have not seen anything that warranted his immediate ban. </p>

<p>That being said the podcast was a bit strange and made me uncomfortable when I watched it not due to the content so much but the atmosphere it created. </p>

<p>As long as we (the users) are informed of the outcome of votes and why they are taking place I don&#39;t see a problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It isnt the crime, but the cover up.   </p>

<p>The video was unwatchabe for its appearence alone.  I couldn&#39;t get past the first 2 minutes to get to the message.  When dealing in controversy, like this sub often does, people look for any reason to discredit the messenger, and the message at that point.   Why help them do that?  </p>

<p>How you could think looking like that would let anyone take the message you were trying to convey seriously, is piss poor judgement imo.</p>

<p>It was worse judgement to not review the video and post it.   </p>

<p>Even worse than that would be to have reviewed it, and still think it came off as something that would represent the 300k people here.</p>

<p>With that being said,  i dont think he should have been removed as a mod for that.</p>

<p>The retalation in banning users here on his part was the exact reason he should have been banned.  There should be no place for that type of behavior here.  </p>

<p>That action in itself should have told the mods that flytape does not posses the maturity to be a mod, nor the responsibility to have banning priveldges for any sub.</p>

<p>He should not be anywhere near a position of authority.  That is the exact thing that has been giving this site a black eye, and has done so again.</p>

<p>I thought the initial reaction from the mods here was correct and gave me hope that maybe they are finally getting it here.  Almost restored a little faith in this site.  </p>

<p>Turns out, instead of fighting the fire that has been going on here for a while, there was gas in the bucket instead of water.</p>

<p>How can any mod vote to reinstate his mod priviledges, when he clearly showed he does not have the maturity to be trusted as a hall moniter in an elementary school, let alone the ability to be able to censor or delete the posts of 300k free thinking adults that are supposed to be his piers or to kiss his ass like some mods expect.</p>

<p>Mods have to be respected.  How can you expect anyone to have respect for flytape at this point?    </p>

<p>What is he going to do when someone throws it in his face that he acted like a punk ass kid that didn&#39;t get his way and took the ball and went home?</p>

<p>He changed overnight?  Please.  He has done things like that before and will do it again. </p>

<p>In effect by reinstatiing him you are telling adults that are twice his age and maturity to respect someone who showed to the 300k people here that he doesn&#39;t have the respect for them.  Or himself by the video he put out.</p>

<p>Again, its not the video, (even though that was bad) but the reaction to opinions on it where he banned the user.   </p>

<p>Even Tricky Dick Richard Nixon had the decency to resign.  If flytape doesn&#39;t, he should be removed.  </p>

<p>If this isn&#39;t nipped in the butt right now, you can expect people to show him the respect he showed the users he banned because he was butt hurt.  In turn, he will pull the same shit and start banning them.</p>

<p>For anyone to think other wise, mod or subscriber are fools.  How can anyone respect him?  Or the mods who voted to reinstate him?  How can anyone expect him to not react like a 4 year old?</p>

<p>With all due respect to the OP, how you think that it is a benifit to the people in this sub rewarding him for doing what cuased the majority of people to split time between this site and another. </p>

<p>Im not saying ban him from posting, but it is in nobodys benifit that he has mod prividleges.</p>

<p>Finally, shouldnt all posts be considered a free for all outside of Reddits sitewide rules?  Espically in this sub, and the &quot;culture of free speech&quot; reddit advertises it self to have on its wiki page.  </p>

<p>The fact you had to put that disclaimer in says alot about the way things are here, and are a far cry from the &quot;culture of free speech&quot; that reddit has prided and built itself on.</p>

Flytape is not the most shining example of the pinnacle of a moderator, but at worst I would judge him as mostly harmless.  I get the frustration and anger... weigh the pros and cons.  People are not going to leave in the thousands because a couple people were very temporarily banned.  The sub is however placed somewhat more at risk whenever it requires more moderators.</p>

<p>My issue was not with the video, but the banning of the users who called it what it was.  It speaks to the maturity level of the person who does that.  That is what has been giving this site the black eye it has.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for admitting that the podcast is relevant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you even realize I do the exact opposite of that?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>just because the recent abuse (out of many cases) happened on a thread that was the podcast doesn&#39;t mean the situation is about the podcast.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I am a shill why have I been a part of this community for twice as long as you and have 4 times your comment score?  What exactly in my post history signifies shill?  Your account has barely any history and hasn&#39;t been on reddit for even a year.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m only defending him because you guys are blowing up my shilldar.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just saying this looks like the pot calling the kettle black when your purposefully detracting from the topic at hand. </p>

<p>So now I will definitely disable my inbox replies this time because I am done feeding the troll. </p>

<p>This was their first time making one and it&#39;s unfortunate that hardly anyone is taking that into account when considering the quality.</p>

<p>In my experience, not true. For every one person like that in this sub there&#39;s 6 downvoting him and telling him to shut the fuck up. </p>
