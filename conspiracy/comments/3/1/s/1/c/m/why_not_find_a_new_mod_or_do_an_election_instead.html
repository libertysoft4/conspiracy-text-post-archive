    <div class="md"><p>with all due respect, thats a bad idea, hear me out:  in a community like this, a relatively small number of people, if they all acted in unison towards a common goal could dominate such an election.   I dont think i have to elaborate any further, hope you catch my drift.</p>

<p>As far as flytape goes,  you may not like him as a moderator, and i respect that.  But wouldnt you rather have someone like that, who you may not see eye to eye with, but AT LEAST you know hes not trying to sensor discussion? Ill admit, hes not a perfect mod.  But his mistakes point to him being a real person who we can put some semblance of trust in.    rolling the dice on another mod?  idk but i dont see that ending well.  I would venture to say that there are people in this sub who for the last year or so have been pretending to be fun, discussion loving people... just waiting for an opportunity to gain a mod spot, and one step closer to this sub being 100% compromised. If we do have an election, i think it MUST be a stipulation that your account must be more than 3 years old.</p>

<p>Id like to know your thoughts, since you were one of the people banned (unjustly) and probably still have a vendetta against him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I made <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/31rxqd/wtftil_flytape_has_been_reinstated_as_a_mod_in/cq4h3rh">this comment on another thread</a>, and I agree.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here is my two cents. I felt mr_dong made the appropriate decision after Flytape swung the ban hammer out of spite. I do not think a mod that compromises his ethics of censorship over petty insults should remain a mod. Sorry Fly, but that&#39;s my opinion.</p>

<p>However, I do believe that Flytape should be given an opportunity to make his defense, and let the community decide whether he stays or goes. In an open vote.</p>

<p>By open I mean with Yays and Nays, not upvotes. In order for your vote to count you must comment Yay or Nay. In effort to limit trolls, socks, and Tards I suggest we come up with voter standards. My suggestion would be that they must be a contributor (comment or post). Have a minimum account age of at least 3 months, and of course no posts history to anti-conspiracy sub-reddits.</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>Flytape has been demodded <strong>TWICE</strong> before this. What happened to &quot;three strikes&quot;? It&#39;s not even like this is a controversial decision. He acted on his personal feelings and banned people. He&#39;s done it before, he&#39;ll do it again, and there is zero reason for him to continue being a moderator here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s disappointing to see how divided this community has become, in the past few days. I can see one unifying factor in all of this, that is supporting your nomination as a moderator. Your posts are consistently on point, and you seem to have integrity, so I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to support your nomination. Under ideal circumstances, I would nominate myself again, however after recent events and the trolling I experienced in the past as a result of being mod here prior, I have no desire to do so again any time soon. Good luck, with that.</p>

<p>I doubt the community here can unite at all, and I doubt further that the mods will acquiesce and even hear us (which I would argue is one more reason to accept that this place is not what it once was, or at least what I thought it was). </p>

<p>Only time will tell, I guess.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no way flytape can be respected by any one in this sub.  Period.  He has shown his willingness to abuse the power of being a mod, has done it before, and its not like he changed over night.  The whole environment of reddit being having a culture of free speech( per their wiki page) is the biggest load of crap I have ever heard, and they need to change that claim before a class action false advertising suit is filed. With every one who has paid for reddit gold, bought one thing from an ad on this site, or gave them money to advertise here.  Once money is spent, there is injury.  People would not have signed up here, or baught anything advertised here if they were truthful about thier site.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s funny is that I was going to ask you the same thing! Think about it: Im pushing for moderation transparency and an end to our subreddit being rigged down to it&#39;s core. You jump from person to person, looking for those who have a similar goal as mine, and then you berate them and call them trolls/sockpuppets simply because they are requesting a little honesty from their moderation team. </p>

<p>THAT is sad. </p>

<p>So I will ask you again, Don&#39;t you have anything better to do?? :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly you&#39;re all losers for getting so wrapped up in this shit. </p>

<p>Go outside, get some fresh air. Who cares if they made a shitty podcast? Lol. I mean really who gives a fuck... It&#39;s utterly inconsequential. </p>

<p>This community kicks ass and if the mods were as corrupt as you assume then this place would have turned to shit long ago. </p>

<p>That being said though, <a href="/u/flytape">/u/flytape</a> has an abrasive personality and needs to learn what the word &quot;tact&quot; means before he goes into any community management ventures.</p>

<p>If he wasn&#39;t such an abrasive dick then it would be much easier to smooth over this stupid drama. But he&#39;s an asshole -- even though he does a good job as a mod IMO -- so it&#39;s easy to hate him. </p>

<p>I should add that I too have been on the receiving end of his ban-happiness. To be fair it was because I called him an idiot (I also have an abrasive personality) and he unbanned me after I apologized. But he certainly needs to calm the fuck down on banning people if he comes back.</p>
