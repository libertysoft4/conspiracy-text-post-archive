<p>I hope you&#39;re doing well. I will keep this short. Transparency of power is essential for functional discussion on Reddit. The Reddit community should push for more transparency in Mod actions.</p>

<p>When I see an entire string of comments deleted from a post, I should be able to see the mod that did it. </p>

<p>When I see that a successful but controversial post was removed from the frontpage, I should be able to see who pulled it. </p>

<p>Otherwise, aren&#39;t we just allowing secret police to control the flow of speech on Reddit.</p>

<p>How can we do this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unless a mod is routinely deleting/blocking posts or blocking users I can&#39;t see how we have a big mod problem here in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> . If that kind of stuff is going on, it seems to only be apparent to a select few who complain about it.</p>

<p>These are Mods, not Admins after all. This whole Mod Drama in this subreddit smells of personality driven drama. </p>

<p>I think it comes about when god-forbid a Mod expresses an opinion or tries to participate. Then, BAM!  Zeus can no longer be divine, for lo, he traipses in the shit like the rest of us while deflowering maidens in his swan form!</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen no evidence of heavy-handedness in this sub. I post here quite a bit, so what am I missing? Well, I abide by the sub&#39;s rules I guess; could that be it?</p>

<p>Intellectually I can&#39;t support any argument <em>solely</em> based on a person&#39;s religion or ethnicity, so maybe I dodged that bullet, eh?</p>

<p>My biggest beef with this sub is not the Mods, it&#39;s that we don&#39;t have as many intellectually honest people as we need for consistently good discussions. </p>

<p>Far too many single agenda driven posters who <em>la-la-la, forever on one note</em> and fail to recognize the composition.</p>

<p>I&#39;m still seeing an issue of severity, if the Mods are truly horrible doing things as I mentioned (deleting/blocking/biased actions) then that is a clear indication that that particular subreddit is toxic.</p>

<p>Now some people will be happy in those echo chambers, but if they are not happy, they should migrate to a sub that reflects their values. And that does not mean a &quot;bunch of preachers preaching to the choir&quot;, but a place where people can discuss and share opinions on a certain range of subjects.</p>

<p>I Mod for two very small, new subs with only a few subscribers. My subs have a focus, one is rather broad and the other fairly narrow.</p>

<p>I hope to eventually attract people who are interested foremost in the sub&#39;s focus enough to discuss, share and debate related subjects. That&#39;s how it should be.</p>

<p>I refrain from <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> and <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> among various other subs because not only the Mods, but the majority of the sub posters in those communities, tend to enjoy the smell of their own farts more than having meaningful conversations or debate. </p>

<p>Subs like those have the Mods they deserve; the minority, non-consensus types will be miserable. But those Subs do not exist for contrarian opinions or intellectually honest debate; those Subreddits are for mutual masturbatory enterprises and rely on their Mods to accommodate them.</p>

<p>Thankfully, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is still good for conversations perhaps with a notable exception or two.</p>

<p>Reddit is not a democracy. Sub creators and their mods don&#39;t owe you anything. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is an important point and where one should begin when embarking on this topic.</p>

<p>To me it&#39;s really simple: <em>Not every subreddit (ie community) will be welcoming or attractive to every redditor.</em></p>

<p>It&#39;s too bad the sub name <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> and <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> are already taken; it sure would be nice to have a more balanced centered sub for discussing news events instead of left-right political nonsense. But, oh well, I don&#39;t sub those communities; and why should I? </p>

<p>Echo chambers are boring. Boring to me, but if you like the echo effect and it reflects your viewpoints, you might love it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In media, an echo chamber is a situation in which information, ideas, or beliefs are amplified or reinforced by transmission and repetition inside an &quot;enclosed&quot; system, where different or competing views are censored, disallowed or otherwise underrepresented<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_chamber_%28media%29">.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> shares the same traits as /politics and the others but with a <strong>key</strong> difference: in this sub the majority of subscribers share a passion for questioning and parsing everything. That&#39;s the unifying principle, now what keeps this from getting boring or just one big mutual masturbatory orgy is the simple fact that all of us will have differing viewpoints in one degree or another on the things we question and parse. </p>

<p>This makes <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> one of the healthier subreddits on Reddit. In fact, outside of the external brigader/manipulator factor; we got things pretty good.</p>
