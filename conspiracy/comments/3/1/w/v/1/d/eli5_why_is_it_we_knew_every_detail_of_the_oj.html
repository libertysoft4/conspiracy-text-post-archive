<p>Presumably they were/are on TRIAL right? Meaning they are technically still innocent until proven guilty? Wouldn&#39;t the American people have interest in learning the ins and outs of the case? Wouldn&#39;t they be HUGE for ratings?</p>

<p>Seems strange. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We saw Saddams dead sons, we saw Ghadafi and I bet we&#39;ll see Asad. You honestly think that people devoted to the terror and destruction of an entire continent would stand down when their leader is murdered but react if his body is shown on TV? </p>

<p>Do you honestly believe the only thing stopping more terror attacks was the fact that they refused to show his body? Even though in every non wester country gore on the news is common place and even within the west we see tons of dead bodies. </p>

<p>Do you actually, honestly believe that the legions of terrorists loyal to or inspired by Osama are willing to stay their hand just because no one showed pictures of his corpse? Honestly. Answer that specific question in yes or no terms. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Answer to your question: no.<br/>
But I never said that anyone would stand down. You wondered if they would react to seeing a pic of Osama. These asshats kill over a fucking cartoon!<br/>
I believe that if they saw OBL&#39;s corpse on tv every five minutes, there would have been many attacks worldwide. Not big planned shit, but a lot of small stuff.<br/>
 Spur of the moment if you will.<br/>
And Hussain, Ghadafi, and Asad can&#39;t be compared to OBL. They were despised tyrants to their people, not beloved leaders in a religious war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Google &quot;Danish Muhammad cartoon&quot;. Or do I need to type slower for you to understand?  I joined this thread to point out a logical fallacy. That you can&#39;t equate photos of the dead BB with pics of a dead OBL.<br/>
I stated my opinion that pics of Osama would incite violence. I used the violent uprisings that came after the cartoons of Muhammad as an example of how easy it is to get religious fanatics to kill.<br/>
I have upvoted everyone who commented politely whether they agreed with me or not.<br/>
Have I made a false statement? Have I called anyone names? No. I&#39;ve been downvoted and insulted for trying to have an intelligent conversation. Why? Because I don&#39;t automatically disbelieve everything on the 6 o&#39;clock news? Because I don&#39;t perpetuate every bullshit, tin foil hat conspiracy theory to fit a worldview that if it comes from the government or mass media it must be lies?<br/>
Sorry I forgot. Only the internet is true.<br/>
Now if I have said something that isn&#39;t true, or if you have anything to add to this conversation, please go ahead. Love to hear it. If not then just don&#39;t comment.</p>

<p>Again, I&#39;m simply pointing out that everything you&#39;re saying here is something you heard on CNN or read in the NYT, whether it&#39;s actually true or not, and at this point a lot of us on this sub are skeptical about taking known liars&#39; word for things at face value.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t presuppose everything is a lie but I also don&#39;t assume I&#39;m being told the truth from those who&#39;ve been caught lying multiple times about multiple things in the past.

<blockquote>
<p>Why do you find anonymous internet sources with no accountability more reliable than mainstream media?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where did I say this?  The point is to be skeptical of all sources and make up your own mind (rather than repeat the talking points you saw on CNN).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How do you keep repeating the same thing over and over again and not realize you&#39;re a parrot?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve been forced to repeat myself because you apparently fail to grasp the very simple point I&#39;ve been making which is that all you&#39;ve done in this thread is repeat talking points.  I didn&#39;t think it was that complicated of a statement to understand but apparently for you it is.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Should I start quoting Brian Williams or Rachel Maddow?  Would that be useful for you?</p>

<p>That matches my understanding of the limited system, and there&#39;s no mention at all of any surveillance cameras in the school beyond the front door. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The government has much to hide in both cases.</p>

<p>The narratives do not add up. For example witnesses at the Aurora theatre make it clear that there were two people involved, one throwing pyrotechnics or something from the front-right while the other was shooting from the front left, or vice versa. Someone let the shooter in. James Holmes was found all drugged out in his car. But they have to make it out to be only about a lone crazed gunman.</p>

<p>In the Isla Vista shooting, witnesses spoke of two people in the car--one was the &quot;handler&quot; (agent) who makes sure it goes down as needed, then he gets outta there. The records are scrubbed to make it appear as only a lone crazed gunman. Similar to the whole &quot;Adam Lanza&quot; BS but there never was an actual Adam Lanza. The Lanza&#39;s only had one son named Ryan. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Spotting a &#39;manufactured event&#39; should never be &#39;quick and easy&#39;. So what is the acceptable amount of coverage that this would have been acceptable?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t live in the US, but if you can even slightly competantly use a search engine, you can get a fair amount of details for a federal case.</p>

<p>Hypothetical: 
Even if it had played out differently, they told you every detail of the prosecution&#39;s case, the defence&#39;s, and could hear the judge&#39;s <em>inner monologue</em>. He recieves the death penalty.</p>

<p>Even in that context, it would still fit to your &#39;FBI Plant&#39; story. &quot;Obviously the government already had this entire court back and forth rigged from the start. Their all in it, paid off. The reporters are all in on it because they were just shoving their corperate master&#39;s propaganda. Now they&#39;re just killing off the patsy. Its so <em>obvious</em>.&quot;</p>

<p>You see how easy that was?</p>

<p>So many angles they could run at with this story. So I can&#39;t believe that there is &quot;no controversy&quot; or that viewers would not be attracted any less compared to whatever other shit show they are putting on the air.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your original question was as to why the trials haven&#39;t received much attention. If your question had been &quot;why haven&#39;t this situations/people gotten much attention&quot; I would tell you you were wrong.  Both the alleged perpetrators and the events have been covered extensively by the media.</p>

<p>Again, for the trials, there is very little question among the general public, right or wrong, about whether or not these people are guilty or whether or not they deserve to be punished. The media can definitely magnify controversy where there is little, but creating controversy out of nothing is not something worth their while.</p>

<p>For example, tighter internet restrictions are needed so stage Charlie Hebdo. They want to work towards taking our guns so they stage events like Sandy Hook. 9/11 also. Boston Marathon Bombing, Aurora shooting, Sandy Hook--all staged events. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m fairly certain that federal cases can&#39;t be televised, which would explain one of the differences between this and the OJ trial (as well as other massive cases like the Clarence Thomas and Kennedy rape) in terms of level of coverage.  Furthermore, in Boston media, this is getting plenty of coverage.</p>

<p>In terms of this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Meaning they are technically still innocent until proven guilty? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would also suggest that it&#39;s likely that this is getting less coverage because they have already entered a guilty plea.  Therefore this isn&#39;t about &quot;innocent until proven guilty&quot; but rather &quot;level of culpability&quot; in order to determine punishment.  Much different again from the OJ case.</p>

<p>Lastly, as I&#39;ve shown above, there are mountains of information coming out of the trial for anybody who is willing to look.  Are there any details that you find lacking in that documentation?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen a couple of answers regarding that interest comes from whether or not the public thinks they are guilty or not.
I can agree with that. Even though these are trials, the majority of people have probably already made up their mind on guilt already, so there isn&#39;t much drama there. At least not in the verdict.</p>

<p>Can anyone think of a trial where the outcome was pretty much decided (GUILTY), yet still received a lot of coverage in the media? I&#39;m at work, brain is fried currently. But I&#39;m going to think about that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those other trials had a lot of media attention because the public was interested in them. The public was interested in the other trials (OJ, zimmerman, anthony, scott peterson, etc) because there was uncertainty and people fell into &quot;guilty&quot; and &quot;not guilty&quot; camps pretty evenly. It was a form of entertainment. The vast majority of people believed that boston bomber was guilty, so they therefore had no interest in following the case closely -&gt; little media coverage. Hell, even his lawyer said he was guilty on numerous occasions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, where&#39;s Jonnie Cochran telling the jury &quot;if the pressure cooker don&#39;t fit (in the back pack) you must acquit&quot;?<br/>
You&#39;d need a pretty good sized backpack like the one those guys in the khakis had to fit even a small pressure cooker inside.  You would also need to disable all the built in safety devices that a pressure cooker has and even then I think the cooker would just rupture at either the o-ring or the lid would deform allowing the gas to escape before it could build up too much pressure.  These things are designed to withstand 5-6 psi.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just going to go off of the Tsarnaev trial (it&#39;s a very personal case to me, so I&#39;ve been following it very closely). Haven&#39;t really been paying attention to the Holmes trial so I can&#39;t comment on that.</p>

<p>If you look you can find plenty - the Tsarnaev trial has been followed every step of the way by the Boston and national media. There&#39;s a fantastic podcast from WBUR (local NPR affiliate) and the Boston Globe with two of their veteran journalists that&#39;s been re-capping every day of the trial. But he&#39;s not a public figure in the way OJ was long before his trial, so it&#39;s not getting the nightly news coverage of that.</p>

<p>And quite frankly, at least in the guilt phase of the Tsarnaev trial, which just ended, the outcome was pretty clear. There&#39;s huge amounts of evidence to back up the government&#39;s case, and his lawyers are focusing on avoiding the death penalty rather than professing his innocence. So unlike the others you mention where there was no certainty about guilt or innocence, it&#39;s not a very interesting case in terms of what the outcome is.</p>
