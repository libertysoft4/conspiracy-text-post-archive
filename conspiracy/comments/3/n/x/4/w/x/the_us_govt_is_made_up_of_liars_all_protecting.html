        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The US govt is made up of liars all protecting the privately owned Federal Reserve Bank.</p>

<p>All the problems that you see in the world are invented to protect the bankers who privately own the Federal Reserve Bank and their scam, which is that they print money and then lend it to the US govt and govts around the world, and it all has to be paid back, so really they are printing money for themselves, and this is what is enslaving the people who do work for money. </p>

<p>The western backed terrorist groups, wars, shootings, ebola, and financial crashes are all manufactured and intentionally caused by the bankers who privately own the Federal Reserve Bank, and are entirely meant to steer people away from noticing their banking scam by keeping people distracted, confused, and scared. </p>

<p>Further, draughts, floods and Global Warming / Climate Change are all intentionally being caused using climate engineering which they use to control the weather to cause these extreme weather related problems.</p>

<p>Their banking scam which is that they privately own the Federal Reserve Bank, is the one BIGGEST problem in the entire world, and by ending it, all the other problems in the world will end, because it is what is causing all the other problems globally. </p>

<p>The destruction of other countries by the US is being done so that the governments of those countries wont start printing their own money, rather than borrow it from these scam artists. Depopulation is another way to protect their scam, the less people there are, the less people there are to control, and the less people there are to notice and put a halt to their scam, hence they are poisoning the environment mainly using climate engineering Aluminum nano-particles, to cause reduced IQ, Alzheimer’s and Autism, and also kill bees, trees, wildlife and humans! They are intentionally creating an atmospheric catastrophe, so they can get a One World Government, which is the ultimate protection for their scam.</p>

<p>Bottom line is that ALL the problems around the world are being invented by the owners of the Federal Reserve Bank, which is privately owned, to distract and divert people away from knowing about thier scam to stop them from putting an end to it, this is also why all wars are started.</p>

<p>The ONLY way to end their scam, including all the problems they are manufacturing around the world, is for the US govt and govts worldwide to print the money themselves, and stop borrowing from the Federal Reserve Bank, a private bank owned by bankers who are, in reality, printing the money for themselves and causing all the problems in the world in order to protect their scam.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You might want to learn a bit more about how the Federal Reserve system actually works. Part of the Federal Reserve, the Board of Governors, is an independent federal agency, with about 1,800 employees. The Board of Governors is led by seven governors, who are nominated by the President of the United States and confirmed by the United States Senate.</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve system also includes 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks (FRBs), which are separate from the government. The stock of each regional FRB is owned by all the member banks in that region. All national banks are members and some state-chartered banks also choose to belong to the Federal Reserve system. Each member bank is required to buy a certain amount of stock that is determined by the member bank&#39;s balance sheet. The stock cannot be traded. There is no stock owned by individuals or families.</p>

<p>Ownership of the stock guarantees an annual dividend equal to 6% of the money invested in the stock. But, unlike a regular private corporation, ownership of the stock doesn&#39;t give you more votes for control. Instead, each member bank has two votes to choose the board of directors, one vote for a class A director, who is a banker, and one vote for a class B director, who cannot be a banker. The small banks in each region pick two directors, the medium size banks pick two directors, and the large banks pick two. The Board of Governors (the federal agency) picks three directors in each region.</p>

<p>After the 6% dividend paid to member banks, all profits of the Federal Reserve system go to the United States government. The Treasury has received <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/annual-report/statistical-tables/2013-statistical-table-11.htm">over 1 trillion dollars</a> from the Federal Reserve over the past century.</p>

<p>Most of the important monetary policy decisions are made either by the Board of Governors (the federal agency) or by the Federal Open Market Committee, which is made up of the seven governors and five of the 12 presidents of the regional Federal Reserve Banks. The minutes of the meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee are released to the public. Also, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve (head of the Board of Governors) must report to Congress every six months.</p>

<p>When the federal government borrows money, it sells bonds at auction. Anybody can lend money to the government by buying these bonds. A portion of the bonds are bought by the Federal Reserve but by far most of them are bought by other individuals, corporations, and foreign governments. Since the Federal Reserve gives almost all its profits back to the government, it&#39;s a great advantage to the government when the Fed buys the bonds. From 1947 to 2007, the Federal Reserve only received about 2% of the <em>net</em> interest on government debt. The other 98% went to the other owners of Treasury bonds. Since the 2008 financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has given the government far more money than it has received from them in interest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wrote it myself. I&#39;ve revised it numerous times. I try to be very specific since the structure of the Federal Reserve system is complicated. The regional banks are separate from the federal government but they are far from a typical private corporation. I don&#39;t want to oversimplify. </p>

<p>You can check the accuracy of what I wrote. Most of it is specified in the law, which is available <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/browse/collectionUScode.action?collectionCode=USCODE&amp;amp;searchPath=Title+12%2FCHAPTER+3&amp;amp;isCollapsed=true&amp;amp;selectedYearFrom=2013">here</a> on the Government Printing Office web site.</p>

<p>You can compare how much the Federal Reserve says it has given the government (<a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/annual-report/statistical-tables/2013-statistical-table-11.htm">here, the two columns under &quot;Distributions to the U.S. Treasury&quot;</a>) with how much the government says it has received, for example <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/Historicals">Historical table 2.5 at the White House Budget Office web site</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>“If you are not an American you will understand why your country is on its present course, as it too is controlled by the Jesuit General through his select Jesuits, Knights of Malta, Shriner Freemasons, the Knights of Columbus, and the Illuminati’s Masonic, Cabalistic, Labor Zionist, Sabbatian Frankist (named after the Black Pope’s baptized Jacob Frank), Jewish House of Rothschild. For the Order controlled the infamous House of Rothschild since no later than the French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars, after which Jesuit-led Crusade the Rothschild family was surnamed the “Guardians of the Vatican Treasury.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All roads lead to Rome.</p>

<p>&quot;The Jesuits used Biddle and Rothschild to gain the upper hand in American banking because they knew they could then control the people and effectively re-write the Constitution according to papal law. Jackson was trying to stop them.&quot; [...]</p>

<p>&quot;We have already seen that the Rothschilds were the banking agents for the papacy’s Church.&quot; [...]</p>

<p>&quot;These three financial families, the Rothschilds, Morgans, and Rockefellers all do the bidding of the Jesuit Order because of Jesuit infiltration in their organizations. They do whatever is necessary to destroy constitutional liberty in America and to bring the pope to world domination. As we look back over the 20th century, we see how successful the Jesuits have been. They have continued to squander the wealth of America and continually attack its great constitution and civil liberties. Daily, the power of the pope in Vatican City increases. One day they will achieve total power again.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re close, but not quite there.  All roads lead to Rome. The Rothschilds are Jesuits. </p>

<p>&quot;The Jews were bought into positions of power within Banking back in 1066 by the Norman Anglo-Saxon Monarchs. For this they accepted being controlled [and scapegoated]. Remember that the Law of Banking is known as International Maritime Admiralty Law. This Maritime Law was based on VATICAN Canon Law. All the “War Banks” known as Central banks get controlled from SMOM controlled Switzerland. The Federal Reserve pays the Bank of England which finally ends up in the Swiss Bank of International Settlements. All you need to do is study the SMOM and its members then look whos who in Banking.”</p>
