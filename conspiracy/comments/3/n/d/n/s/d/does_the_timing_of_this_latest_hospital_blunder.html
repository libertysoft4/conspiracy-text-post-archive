The post-war solution, of course, will be NWO&#39;s new and improved world government. The kink in that plan is that China still refuses to join the NWO, potentially leaving them without an enforcer when the smoke clears.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suspect china did have a falling out with the Zionist mafia. They&#39;re not the ones to play second fiddle to anyone. Certainly does not make them any less dangerous, however. Russia has had a wholesale regime change with its generals. A good sign! And I suspect that may not be the original putin. In any case, I like this new and improved Russian leader. Just not enough info to properly connect the dots. Facinating times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There were rumours that this is a look alike putin used. Given that there was a wholesale cleansing of his generals, I think it&#39;s a possibility.

Hell, back during the first gulf war, there were a number of cases where friendly fire situations happened and it wasn&#39;t until the dust really settled and troops came up missing that people realized what had happened.

Possibly the rage wouldn&#39;t be so loud if it wasn&#39;t for the irony of the west pointing fingers at Russia.</p>

<p>Now with my tin foil hat on, my personal theory is that Russia (somehow) scrambled the signals, misleading the strikes into the hospital. Of course Washington would never declare this happened, the humiliation, and GPS-integrity are far too greater risks. And besides Moscow would straight face deny it. </p>
