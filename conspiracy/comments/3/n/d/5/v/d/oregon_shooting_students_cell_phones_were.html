<blockquote>
<p>Sometime after noon, students’ cell phones were confiscated, then students were marched out one building at a time, hands up, patted down and lined up to be evacuated on buses.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why did they take the phones? Also, why were there no photos from any of the students or the faculty?
I&#39;d like to see any photos taken by a student during this event, not because I&#39;m a sicko, but because it would help me believe this is real. Aren&#39;t kids snapping photos and videos of crap all the time? Yet there are absolutely no photos to be found from inside the school during the event.</p>

<p>I scoured the internet for hours looking for some shred of evidence that would prove to me that this event actually took place as described by the news. The result was two photos. These photos were described as being GRAPHIC CONTENT. Um, these is not graphic at all. A few spots of blood on a sheet thrown over a non-bloody body.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.slimgr.com/images/2015/10/02/7d6a96f839326b00d8d69bd1236f3f81.jpg">Photo 1</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.slimgr.com/images/2015/10/02/bf1d928b73a97c16ace58d9a67747f8c.jpg">Photo 2</a></p>

<p>I found <a href="http://abc13.com/news/paris-train-hero-enrolled-in-umpqua-reacts-to-school-shooting/1013174/">this strange coincidence</a> on ABC13 EyeWitness News. What are the odds of two international heroes going to the same small community college?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Alek Skarlatos, one of the Americans who became an international hero when he stopped a terror attack on a Paris train, was enrolled in classes at Umpqua Community College this semester. The Army National Guard specialist was not in Roseburg Thursday when a gunman opened fire on campus, but wishes he could have tried to prevent another tragedy.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mynews4.com/mostpopular/story/Umpqua-Shooting-Timeline-of-events-with-photos/Jw6XDm6EjESzbXVY6bOE0w.cspx">This article</a> shows how a story like this can have many different versions. If the story occured as the news reports, which version is true?</p>

<p>Anyway, the shooting happened inside a building and there would obviously be places on the campus where it wouldn&#39;t be heard as clearly. It&#39;s not the hugest place but gunfire also doesn&#39;t sound like it does in movies.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pObOWBbLpZQ">this video</a> where survivors say they heard a book dropping or a table falling. They always describe the shooting sounds as being something other than a gunshot.</p>

<p>Someone who watches the news? </p>

<p>Also depending on the acoustics of the building and where they were at the time its not out of the realm of possability that certain people did not hear the gunshots. It&#39;s amusing how many of these &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; come from people who thinks everything works like Hollywood. A person shot is going to gush blood all over the place. Gunshots are louder than nuclear bomb detonations so everyone will hear them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would be a lot more inclined to think like you if this didn&#39;t happen in <em>every single shooting</em> we are deeming a false flag. Watch the interviews with children at Sandy Hook and notice how similar their stories are. If there are really 33 people getting shot, you&#39;re going to get at least SOME witnesses who heard this. Either the news is pathetic at finding a real witness, or there simply are none.</p>

<p>Flash back to the shooting at Virginia Tech. The link below contains some credible witness testimony along with video in which shooting can be heard. This happened even before the first iPhone came out. 8 years later, virtually everybody has an HD camera on them, and there&#39;s <em>nothing</em> similar to this that exists at all? Look up other witness interviews, even the survivors, and see how somber and emotional they are when recalling the tragedy. Not similar to anything we&#39;ve seen in false flags.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtRKW3VxjyQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtRKW3VxjyQ</a></p>

<p>Bonus link: The enlightened know that these are routine mass casualty drills/exercises. Staging these shootings is not only a precursor to advancing gun control laws, but it&#39;s also a way to keep the DoJ and DHS funded so they can continue planning even more drills, some of which will no doubt be passed to the media as real again. In this link, the interviewee mentions these exercises, but is <em>immediately</em> cut off by the anchor due to a very rare, bizarre exchange with the producers. They then switch to another reporter for an update, except, none of the news she gives us is any different than what&#39;s been showed on the screen the entire time.</p>

<p>Plus when you&#39;re in a class you automatically use the same language as the prof, so you would automatically echo words used by authority figures while still in that &quot;classroom&quot; mindset.</p>

<p>Pretty sure I have been guilty of both.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all you bud, not me.  I simply said it is strange and suspicious, but you&#39;re taking the ball and running for the goal line with it, and making these claims that it happened/never happened.  Neither one of us were there, so neither one of us knows for sure what really went on.  I&#39;m just giving you rope.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is like the POV aspect of the Virginia shooting. Film it in POV to make it look real, but have him &quot;drop the camera&quot; before anything is actually is shown. Maybe I&#39;ve watched too much TV, but don&#39;t they usually cover the entire body in a sheet at the very least, if not put it in a body bag? I thought it was normal procedure to cover it with a sheet at the scene during the investigation and then put it in a body bag for transport? Here they have a sheet which would cover a small dog or child used to cover an adult leaving the arms and legs exposed. I think this is done to make it look real since it looks like a body, and very well could be, but they still had to cover the face and chest to keep people from seeing their expressions or breathing. You can&#39;t tell me nobody could get ahold of 13 sheets or anything big enough to cover the bodies(not to mention BODY BAGS), and had to resort to 3x4 ft towels? Gimme a fucking break</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lame. The random killing spree bullshit is passé. Unless you&#39;re doing something like that for political or religious reasons, you wouldn&#39;t do it. The &quot;high score&quot; theories (basically that there&#39;s crazy people trying to go and pull off a huge killing spree in the hopes they&#39;ll be famous in death by killing the most people) don&#39;t make any sense anymore because you would expect someone to have pulled off a bigger killing spree by now, using more than just some assault rifles/pistols or these shitty homemade bombs that never seem to work (remember the Times Square Bomber?). It&#39;s always some Aspergers or Autistic kid, and they&#39;re always obsessed with guns, yada yada yada. But what makes them go from being so unable to understand other people to having the conviction to go and kill others at the cost of their freedom or life? Psychopaths don&#39;t do that. Why would someone even more unable to empathize know the pain they are causing? The Columbine story was most believable because they were two outcasts supposedly bullied and made fun of, and were doing it for revenge. Ok. Then you have Virginia Tech, which was this philosophical crazy reightous bullshit manifesto. Ok, kinda flimsy but he had pictures/video he made of himself. Then there&#39;s Sandy Hook and Aurora. Holmes claimed to be the fucking Joker but had orange hair not blue, and was practically catatonic during trial, and Adam Lanza&#39;s (if he existed) motives are completely unknown (but we know he could play DDR for 10+ hrs straight!). But Lanza and a lot of smaller, less remembered shooters are often claimed to have Aspergers, something that doesn&#39;t make sense if your expecting them to care about whether or not the rest of society knows who they are. The recent live news shooting was the result of &quot;racist comments&quot;... It&#39;s all bullshit, and it&#39;s bad for ya</p>
