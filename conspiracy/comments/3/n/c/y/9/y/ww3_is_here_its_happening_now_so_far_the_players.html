<p>That&#39;s a pretty deep squad for Team America.  I don&#39;t see how it&#39;s possible that Russia wins this.  Maybe President Obama was right (I never thought I&#39;d say those words) yesterday, when he said Russia is flexing their might from a position of domestic weakness,  rather then strength.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>World War 3 will start off with humanity firing all of their nuclear weapons at once</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a false assumption. I understand that, in many people&#39;s minds, WWIII is synonymous with total nuclear war. But it doesn&#39;t have to be nuclear, or total to qualify as WWIII.</p>

<p>Consider WWII as a good model for how the sequence of events for a third world war could progress. Long years of simmering tensions (1930&#39;s German rearmament). Isolated regional conflicts (eg. Japanese occupation of China). Things still aren&#39;t that bad until one action pushes things past a tipping point (eg. German invasion of Poland, Pearl Harbor).</p>

<p>Then, many major powers quickly side up with each other and achieve a solution through war. There isn&#39;t much motivation to resort to nuclear weapons in the early stages of another global conflict.</p>

<p>Russia managed to keep a Western backed government in Ukraine from joining NATO and taking Crimea with it. What&#39;s more, they did this by supporting the conflict in Eastern Ukraine and keeping it from getting out of control.</p>

<p>Now the Russians have gotten involved in another conflict in Syria. This time they&#39;re facing off against yet another Western proxy in the form of the various anti-Assad factions.</p>

<p>Is regime change in Syria worth escalating all the way to a nuclear standoff between Russia and the US? Is supporting a close ally worth the same to the Russians?</p>

<p>We&#39;ll see. In any case, I would expect wide scale use of conventional forces for at least a few weeks before anyone went nuclear. You might even see use of nukes limited to just a few dozen weapons before sanity prevails and someone calls it quits.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not necessarily true at all. </p>

<p>There are many nuclear weapons with variable yields. For example, a US made <a href="http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Usa/Weapons/B61.html">B61-3</a>, intended as a tactical nuke, can be dialed down to .3KT or 300 tons of TNT yield. That&#39;s compared to the original &quot;Little Boy&quot; weapon that hit Hiroshima, which had an estimated output of about 16KT. </p>

<p>Most modern thermonuclear weapons intended for airburst (to destroy cities) top off at between 100KT to 1MT. Mostly because war planners have determined that it&#39;s more effective to hit a city with multiple smaller weapons than a single bomb with very high yield.</p>

<p>You simply don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about. </p>

<p>Therefore, no.  WWIII will not be  &quot;nuke war&quot;.  It will be a financial and covert and proxy war.  As such, we&#39;ve <em>been</em> in WWIII for years now because this is exactly the kind of war that has been taking place globally for quite a while as it stands.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A) The underground bases will be for the <em>very</em> elite - the .001%</p>

<p>B) The 99.99% (including many millionaires) would be dead and gone.</p>

<p>Therefore, C) there is a collective swath of millionaire .1 and .01%ers that still have quite a bit of power in preventing the .001% <em>billionaires</em> (and above) from being <em>that</em> megalomaniacle.  Additionally, D) the .001% that would remain in a nuclear fallout would end up having to fend for themselves instead of getting to continue to be parasites off of all their 99% slaves as is the case now.</p>

<p>And you think they&#39;ll want to deal with a world where the environment they live in is completely destroyed and they can&#39;t even go above ground because they nuked everything?</p>

<p>Everyone has needs, and while it&#39;s unfortunate that TPTB use us as unwitting slaves, the fact of the matter is that they <em>need</em> us unwitting slaves in order to maintain their evil, opulent lifestyles.  They know the moment they kill all of us is the moment that opulent lifestyle goes away because they would no longer have any slaves to do all the work for them, be parasites off of, and they will have to fend for themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Oh humanity will survive alright, multiple times in the past too. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, no, bro.  You don&#39;t understand.  When I say &quot;humanity won&#39;t survive.&quot; I mean &quot;This VERSION of humanity won&#39;t survive.&quot;</p>

<p>We get seeded and re-seeded - over and over again - just as you (knowingly or not) intimated in the statement I just quoted above.</p>

<p>Humanity <em>will</em> survive.  There are powers (in all likelihood <em>not</em> from this planet) that make sure that the human form continues...on this planet, and on many, many others.  However, that&#39;s not what I&#39;m talking about.  I&#39;m talking about THIS version of humanity - THIS version of the human race.</p>

<p>We try to have a nuke war, and THIS version of humanity will be yet another one that will be going &quot;bye bye&quot; - just like all the others came and went.  The human form in general will continue on, however.</p>

<p>Therefore, although you are right that humanity will indeed survive, it is only humanity in the <em>overall</em> sense - humanity as it pertains to &quot;the species in general&quot; - that will survive.  THIS particular version of humanity will go <em>very</em> much the fuck away if a nuke war goes down.  Believe that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s just that you and me and mostly everyone won&#39;t survive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Correct.  You and me and most everyone won&#39;t survive.  Matter of fact, pretty much EVERY human on Earth won&#39;t survive...and the .001% elite know that.  Therefore, those that are still here and that are not part of that group of super DUPER select elite that already have their &quot;ticket to another planet for when the human race nukes itself&quot; will not want at all to nuke themselves and die.  They won&#39;t allow that - and considering that a good deal of them are likely in charge and in control of the governments that would use those nukes on each other, I&#39;m not sure such a thing as a nuke war would be allowed.</p>

<p>In addition to all this, it is said that there are forces and powers FAAAAR above and beyond anything that exists on this planet that have a vested interest in making sure that the stupid humans on this planet don&#39;t fuck up the planet <em>or</em> some of the other very important species here too much, so some of those very advanced species simply won&#39;t let humanity nuke itself...not because they care oh so much for humanity, but because they care for THE PLANET HERSELF and don&#39;t want to see <em>her</em> get nuked by our dumb actions.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_8QFnrgccg">We&#39;ve already been stopped before from using bombs</a>.  There&#39;s no reason why we may not be completely prevented from going &quot;full nuclear&quot; on ourselves and the planet if other more powerful forces don&#39;t want that.</p>
