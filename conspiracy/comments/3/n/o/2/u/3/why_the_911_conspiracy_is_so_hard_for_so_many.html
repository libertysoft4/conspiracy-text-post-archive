        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It is simply unimaginable to most Americans that people inside their own government might actually kill their own citizens in order to achieve their own monetary goals. It also is simply unimaginable how they could keep something this vast of a conspiracy a secret. </p>

<p>Taking a closer look, however, you have to ask who gained from this event and who was complicit in the cover up:</p>

<p><strong>WHO GAINED:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A massive Wall Street money laundering scheme took place on 9/11</li>
<li>Insider Trading was also going on pre 9/11</li>
<li>The Military Industrial Complex scored big time</li>
<li>The Energy Industry (oil and energy transport pipelines)</li>
<li>Private Contractors to rebuild Iraq</li>
<li>Brzezinski&#39;s Grand Chessboard (Parts of Asia are next)</li>
<li>Big Brother - The Patriot Act (Homeland Security) and spending on National Defense. </li>
</ul>

<p>Just to name a few.</p>

<p><strong>WHO WAS COMPLICIT IN THE COVER-UP:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>All of Congress who sat back and did nothing</li>
<li>NIST</li>
<li>The White House via gag orders for &quot;National Security&quot; reasons to anyone who knew ANYTHING. This includes the family members of victims of 9/11.</li>
<li>The Media - Including Social Media </li>
</ul>

<p>Again, just to name a few.</p>

<p><strong>SO WHY DON&#39;T WE DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT?</strong></p>

<p>The answer should be fairly obvious. The government has proven that it will fire on its own citizens in a massive false flag attack and we are simply out-weaponed. It would mean certain death...not possible death, but certain death. American citizens simply cannot fight this alone. We would need another world super power to intervene and liberate us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Completely misses the mark.  Most people don&#39;t believe 9/11 was a govt conspiracy because no one has presented clear, solid evidence to support that claim.  They know govt does bad things, half of USA hates whatever party is in power at any given time, approval rating for Congress is something like 9%.  But they don&#39;t see any good evidence that 9/11 was a govt conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not the commenter, but I&#39;m here to learn, and because I think these conspiracy theories are false and do real harm. We should oppose harmful falsehoods.  I&#39;m willing to be convinced by evidence, but the 9/11 guys have no solid evidence, so I think their theories are false.</p>

<p>If the lesson we learn from 9/11 is &quot;govt is evil&quot; or &quot;the Jews did it&quot;, when the real lesson (I think) is &quot;we should stop supporting dictators and invading countries&quot;, we risk more 9/11&#39;s. And people in the Mideast don&#39;t learn the lesson &quot;we should stop the extremists among us&quot;.</p>

<p>If the lesson we learn from big events (9/11, Boston Bombing, HIV/AIDS, Ebola) is &quot;don&#39;t trust anything the govt or scientists say&quot;, that helps lead to &quot;deny climate change, refuse vaccines, deny evolution&quot;.  In places such as Africa, it costs many lives every year.</p>

<p>Conspiracy theories generally are a form of religion: belief without evidence, even belief despite the evidence. This harms our country and our society.</p>

<p>And the logic of conspiracy theorists often is EXACTLY that of the religious: &quot;I have no evidence for my claim, but if I can cast doubt on science/govt&#39;s evidence, that means my claim must be correct, right ?&quot;.  No.</p>

<p>Yes, there have been real conspiracies. Yes, there is plenty of malice and incompetence by govts or govt agencies. But these conspiracy theories are a different thing: start with desired conclusion, and invent/deny facts to justify it.</p>

<p>Because you said the families were in on the cover up and offered proof by way of an agreement they had to sign to get access to information. That doesn&#39;t prove the families were covering up anything.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>people do not want to believe, because if they did their entire idea of what and who their country is would be shattered.</p>

<p>like a mother who refuses to believe their kid is a heroin addict. they are willing to cling to the bullshit, the lies and the constant relapses, becuase if they just pretend it isn&#39;t true they get to go on with their regular routine because &quot;everything is okay..... all those niceties and comforts just keep on going, no hard conversations, no tough choices, no shame of having to put your own elected officials in front of a war crimes tribunal.</p>

<p>never having to face the fact that you raised, propped up, and created the monster, never having to hear them say &quot;but all those awful things.... i did them for you&quot; </p>

<p>ignorance is bliss, and if you are anything like me you probably wish that you could unlearn whatever it was that made you initially doubt the &quot;story&quot; and go back to being one of those blissfully ignorant people..... </p>

<p>part of me really wants to let them go on in that ignorance, but there is the morality question.</p>

<p>are they better off knowing or not? 
at this point i don&#39;t think there is anything that will stop this rock from rolling down the hill. so is it better to yell so they turn around and see the rock, or stay silent and not let them see it coming, the end result will still likely be the same...</p>

<p>This is the favorite canard of the CT set to explain away the &quot;sheep&#39;s&quot; inability to comprehend the clarity of vision of the truther&#39;s understanding of the events of 9/11 and, it&#39;s pure unadulterated rubbish. </p>

<p>It is simply unimaginable to most Americans that people inside their own government might actually kill their own citizens in order to achieve their own monetary goals. It also is simply unimaginable how they could keep something this vast of a conspiracy a secret.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People are bad at keeping secrets. People are exponentially worse at keeping secrets as a group. It is not reasonable to assume millions of people have kept a secret from the other 330 million of us for 10 + years. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The answer should be fairly obvious. The government has proven that it will fire on its own citizens in a massive false flag attack and we are simply out-weaponed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why would they waste time and money to create this massive operation when they could simply kill you for saying something they don&#39;t like? Why are there so many truthers if the government is really not only capable of, but proficient at mass murder cover ups? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>American citizens simply cannot fight this alone. We would need another world super power to intervene and liberate us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What world power would you prefer? Would you like to be forced to live under the regime of China or Russia, and only then after surviving through prolonged warfare?</p>

<p>Wake up. Your hypothesis makes no sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are not out weaponed.  They might have <em>bigger</em> weapons, but A) there are more of us than them - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLbWnJGlyMU">a <em>lot</em> more</a> - and B) some of them <em>will</em> indeed come over on our side.</p>

<p>Maybe for you.  Maybe for me.  But not for ALL of us if we all come together and fight together as one citizenry - one people.  The <em>movement</em> will win even if some of us perish.</p>

<p>No disrespect, but this is the <em>exact</em> recipe for disaster for the American people.  We are fucking SHEEP, bro.  Do we want to stop looking like or being called or BEING sheep?  Well then we need to stop <em>acting</em> like sheep.  If we continue to act like sheep and let some other country &quot;<a href="https://circlesunderstreetlights.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/happy-crying-rage-face.jpg">save us</a>&quot;, then what will keep them from doing the same thing that the American PTB are doing against us?</p>

<p>The ONLY way that the cycle of oppression can be broken is if WE ourselves as a citizenry stand up TOGETHER.  That is the <em>only</em> way.  Otherwise, don&#39;t think for a second that <em>anything</em> will change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only real solution I see involves, first and foremost, the citizenry putting down all the ingrained indoctrination brainwashed into us - overtly and covertly getting us to be antagonistic toward one another because of race, because of class, because of religion, because of education, because of social status, money, etc, etc.  We <em>first</em> have to realize that we are all one.  We are all one people.  Together.</p>

<p>If we do this, then we can come together and help each other without having to be so beholden (if beholden at all) to the enslaving paradigm of money.  We can help feed each other, clothe each other, house each other.  If we help each other independent of the indoctrinated stratifications we&#39;ve been, again, brainwashed with from birth, and we realize that this whole civilization has been basically structured to keep us (falsely) believing that &quot;we are just different from one another&quot; (for any one or more of the millions of reasons we&#39;re constantly bombarded with) and it is, as a result of these conditioned differences, therefore okay to be at least a <em>little</em> prejudice or antagonistic toward one another; if we can see the truth that exist <em>past</em> all these lies, then we literally can all come together, rise up together, and help one another overcome the manipulation that is keeping <em>all</em> of us down.</p>

<p>Without us FIRST putting down our prejudices and racism, however, it seems that no proposal for what could possibly be done against TPTB will work.</p>

<p>We talk about &quot;not wanting to be enslaved&quot;, but we don&#39;t do the things that we need to in order to <em>keep</em> from being enslaved.  So long as we don&#39;t break the mental indoctrination, we are essentially pissing in the wind and we should not get too upset over being a ruled species.</p>

<p>We need to first stand up together and be <em>worthy</em> of not being ruled - we need to <em>act</em> in accord with what we need to do as a people to <em>not</em> be ruled - before we make any real forward progress.</p>

<p>EDIT:  Wow.  The fact that somebody actually downvoted the idea of our coming together as a people and as a citizenry I guess shows just how far we have to go before we are even <em>close</em> to the place we need to be before we have any chance of coming out of this okay as a country.  Shit.  :/</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;re not united already, however.  Two or three or even ten or twenty of one&#39;s best buds that are all of different classes and creeds is not enough.  What I&#39;m talking about is a critical mass of citizenry doing that and feeling that for each other without necessarily having to be &quot;best buds&quot; or friends or even personally knowing each other - yet still coming together, helping each other, and moving against TPTB&#39;s manipulation and chicanery.</p>

<p>THAT, we are nowhere near to at this point, unfortunately.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suggest simply putting out videos with this kind of message.  Also I make it a point to simply try to be as cool and honest with literally everyone I meet regardless of who it is.  My other suggestion is to organize a social movement/meetup/demonstration of sorts, and I&#39;m really <em>all</em> for that, but I don&#39;t know too much of the first thing about how to <em>organize</em> a demonstration of this sort, honestly.</p>
