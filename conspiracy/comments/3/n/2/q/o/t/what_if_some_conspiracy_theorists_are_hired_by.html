        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">40</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2015-10-01 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Zeydon.html">Zeydon</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As many of us may recognize, conspiracy theorists are often <em>perceived</em> as not entirely logically sound by mainstream audiences.  Is there <em>any</em> truth to this?  I&#39;ll work my way to that in a bit.</p>

<p>Odds are, not <em>all</em> conspiracy theories are grounded in reality, but it&#39;s not like there aren&#39;t <em>any</em> real conspiracies either.  There have certainly been actual <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2015/02/41-admitted-false-flag-attacks.html">false flag operations</a> in the past that even the guilty party has eventually admitted to.</p>

<p>If a false flag operation were to occur today, with how interconnected we all are thanks to the internet, word of the duplicitous nature of such an operation could spread like wildfire if evidence is collected, right?  And the more elaborate the plot, the more people involved and thus the harder it becomes to ensure every individual maintains their oath of secrecy.  A conspiracy where a dozen, tight-nit collaborators are the only ones involved it would be easy to keep everyone quiet.  But a conspiracy involving hundreds of actors would be much more difficult to ensure uniform silence, if not impossible.  And if there&#39;s thousands of actors involved, forget about it: someone, if not many people, are going to spill the beans at some point.</p>

<p>So, if you&#39;re a government entity and you need to carry out a false flag operation to pursue your geopolitical goals, what options are available to ensure it remains unnoticed by the populace if you cannot guarantee secrecy?  I propose the solution to this would be to make sure there is a very low signal-to-noise ratio.  In other words, if you want to carry out a false flag operation, hire some folks to start spreading theories about various ridiculously untrue false flag ops without any solid evidence to support them.  Ordinary folks will quickly learn to dismiss rumors of false flag operations once they&#39;ve been repeatedly exposed to preposterous ones.  So then, when an actual true conspiracy is carried out, it falls on deaf ears, because most people conclude it&#39;s just another case of the Boy Who Cries Wolf.</p>

<p>Do you think this is plausible?  Might there be some among us who deliberately come up with preposterous theories in order to distract the masses, as well as fellow conspiracy theorists, from true conspiracies?  Unless we critically scrutinize all of our conspiracies, I doubt we&#39;ll ever know for sure.</p>

<p>I suppose my follow-up question would then be, how does one best assess whether a conspiracy that&#39;s been presented has validity or not?  What are the markings of a trustworthy source, or are there any?  We can choose not to trust <em>anyone</em> implicitly, but then what are we left with to build our view of the world around?  Do you try to start from scratch: is that even possible?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve got a hell of a lot more questions than answers, but I suppose that is inevitable if I am truly invested in the search for truth.</p>

<p>how does one best assess whether a conspiracy that&#39;s been presented has validity or not? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Research, research, research. From as many different sources as possible. Some we will never know about, some will become declassified over time and some are right in front of us if we know history.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What are the markings of a trustworthy source, or are there any?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>None that you can be 100% certain of. Everything thing has truth, yet everything also has bias and/or lies. You need to learn to spot the truth and the lies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We can choose not to trust anyone implicitly, but then what are we left with to build our view of the world around?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the point of seeking truth. You honestly cannot trust anyone, but yourself and your mind. However, that doesn&#39;t mean you should shut everyone out. You need to relearn how to learn and process information and critical thinking.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you try to start from scratch: is that even possible?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes and yes. This is a must. You must break yourself out and come a new, then re look into things. Break out of your previous mold, your previous world views, possibly previous religious views, etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve got a hell of a lot more questions than answers</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve looked into/read/watch/researched many things (I&#39;m still a kid though in this, we all are). Everything from history, to science, to ancient mystery schools, alchemy, to religion, to the occult and esoteric teachings. We will always have more questions than answers. It&#39;s better to have more questions than answers. A fool thinks he has all the answers, but a wise person will always have more questions than answers ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see it all the time. Usually on better than average 9/11 YouTube videos. And what is troubling is that the comment that really makes people who are seeking the truth (the pejorative &quot;truthers&quot;) look seriously out of touch are always nearer to the top. Either they stay at it, or someone is helping to keep those comments viewable to anyone who might watch the video.</p>

<p>Recently I watched one... Maybe it was that last <em>Loose Change</em> installment, and there is some guy who agrees and writes something in accord with the video, but then adds illuminati culpability, including Rihanna and Kanye West, mentions the use of holograms, and ends on stating the government has been covering up things for so long people <em>must</em> wake up...&quot;they don&#39;t even realize there are pneumatic tube trains running between N.Y., D.C. and L.A.&quot;</p>

<p>Other than the Rihanna/Kanye thing, I know there are some other credible people who have written about tunnels throughout the subterranean U.S. (high speed train containing or otherwise) and there certainly are huge bunkers underground that were started just after WWII, but these people are clever. They blend a little reasonable suspicion (like we all want to see in others)...But then diverge into something more absurd. Closer to sounding like someone who is paranoid/delusional than not.</p>

<p>And anyone watching the video who might have started to have doubts about the official narrative...they see these comments, they start believing &quot;oh no I am becoming a &quot;crazy conspiracy theorist&quot; now&quot;, and go right back to their old beliefs. </p>

<p>I really despise these People... Both the planted &quot;crazies&quot; and the regular paid shills who simply offer a single credible counter-arguments and repeat it over and over. </p>

<p>Nietzsche wasn&#39;t even the ubermensch, but rather a prophet of the ubermensch. The ubermensch fears not becoming the abyss, for the abyss was always in him. To face what lies in shadows, one mustn&#39;t fear shadows. Light only reaches the crevasse when one enters it and willfully and artificially illuminates it.</p>
