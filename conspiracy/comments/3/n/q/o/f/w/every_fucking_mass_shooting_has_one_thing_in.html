    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s true, you see the same thing in discussion about opioids. People are so terrified that they might not have access to them that they can&#39;t speak openly about their dangers - there&#39;s no middle ground. SSRIs, Benzodiazepines, and antipsychotics can likely be administered safely given safeguards, patient education, and additional study, but regular people are terrified that the &quot;patient education&quot; part will remove them from the market (not likely).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is every weed-user on Reddit a fuckin child-minded twat?</p>

<p>I admit, the idea that weed makes people mellow or that &quot;if everyone smoked weed, the world would be peaceful&quot; is something I once, too, agreed with when I was a fuckin kid, but then you grow up and become an adult. You meet many more people. Rapists and killers recruited in guerrilla warfare in scary countries you&#39;ve never been to smoke weed every day and wouldn&#39;t think twice to cut your dick off just to mellow out the high a bit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Step 1: get children hooked on drugs that (admittedly) &quot;change&quot; (read &quot;reduce the chemical tolerance to&quot;) the natural empathy centers in the brain.</p>

<p>Step 2: remind them regularly that the system is rigged and that sociopolitical and financial growth is only possible for &quot;chosen&quot; entities.</p>

<p>Step 3: continuously remind them that there&#39;s something &quot;wrong&quot; with them for feeling upset with this.</p>

<p>Step 4: up their medicines when they &quot;stop working&quot; and the person gets angrier and more depressed.</p>

<p>Step 5: repeat steps 1-4 until the person becomes dehumanized and apathetic (funny how this word has the same suffix as EMpathetic).</p>

<p>Step 6: showboat the &quot;surprising&quot; results so that more people become scared and depressed so that they too can be locked into steps 1-5.</p>

The prescribing information that comes with his medication probably tells you all this and lists the possible adverse affects and hopefully your doc walked you both through all this, and I am assuming you guys have read the documentation from the pharmacist, but if you haven&#39;t, please take the time to, because it&#39;s your health and it&#39;s important to know as there are dangerous side effects that affect some people (not everyone) but people aren&#39;t educated about them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The majority of the population is now on some sort of ssri / depression / adhd drug.</p>

<p>The whole thing is pure comedy to me.</p>

<p>People in the past got sad too. The difference is that they didnt feel entitled the way people nowadays do. In the past people worked through their problems with hard work, reassessing their lives and decisions, taking responsibility for their actions, etc.</p>

<p>Nowadays people just want a pill that will stop them from thinking, because when they have time to think they realize their whole lives... their values... their beliefs, are just a bunch of BS, and instead of taking the time to change them, they just spend the money to get the drugs that will help them to ignore it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been though it all.</p>

<p>Not gonna get into details, but I will say this: </p>

<p>The source of the problem and the solution to the problem are related.</p>

<p>The mind has this amazing capacity to influence not only the functioning of the brain, but of the whole body.</p>

<p>This works in both directions.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a matter of thinking ones self through it, but a matter of growing through it. Habits needs to change. Thought patterns need to change. Learned behaviors need to be altered. Diet need to change. Sleep habits. Exercise. Media consumption habits. Belief systems. All of it. The Will needs to be reborn. In too many people, the Will does not exist. Their soul is a lazy automaton that is afraid of hard work and tough lessons.</p>

<p>Fucking with neurotransmitters through taking drugs for which the effects are barely understood as a blanket fix for many of the ills which occur because of lifestyle decisions (yes including diet and intake of pollutants) is only worsening the problem.</p>

<p>The lasting path to bringing the being back into a natural balance is a difficult one, but the other option, of popping pills in hope for a magic fix (with often horrific side effects) is honestly not a viable option. If you want to erase, and be numb, no need for ssri. Benzo&#39;s got your back. No amount of pills is gonna bring anyone back to normal.</p>

<p>Therapy works. Why? Because therapy involved growth and change.</p>

<p>All therapy is self therapy. The reason we pay therapists is because we believe the solution to all our problems is outside of our control.</p>

<p>Typical human though patterns: blame everyone else for the bad shit. It&#39;s my parent, my upbringing, the way others treat me... etc etc... that has led me to have a low self esteem. That has led me to hate myself.</p>

<p>Always got the finger pointing the wrong way.</p>

<p>The first true step always starts with an honest assessment of the situation. You gotta be able to look in the mirror and know that who you see right there... that person was the architect of your own demise. That persons decisions and reactions are what led you to where you are now. Not anyone else. Not society. Not your parents.</p>

<p>Problem is, no one wants to believe they are actually the ones fucking it up for themselves because they are too lazy to undertake the work that&#39;s needed. The work is hard. No one wants hard work. We just want the rewards of hard work. And we want it now.</p>

<p>Fine. You admit the problem. The first step to getting better. That you have depression. FUCKING WRONG. Depression is a symptom of the problem. The problem is deeper than that. Until you admit the actual root of the problem true growth cannot occur. Until you tear out that diseased problem root, nothing good can grow in it&#39;s place. </p>

<p>So what is the true root of it all?</p>

<p>What have you lost?</p>

<p>Your birthright. Your true capabilities. </p>

<p>And who took it from you? Or did you just give it up yourself, and forget about it all?</p>

<p>&quot;Life is too hard. It&#39;s not fair. I am not what I wanted to be. I make choices that worsen my mental and emotional and physical state.&quot;</p>

<p>Why. </p>

<p>Because you have a will towards self destruction?</p>

<p>Was this will towards self destruction there the day you were born, or was it learned? Who taught it to you? Why did you listen? Can you unlearn it? Can you relearn something new? Were you a bad student and is learning just &quot;too hard&quot; for you?</p>

<p>Ah. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Are you a therapist by chance?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, although I did study towards it in university when I was young, because I was interested in solving my own mental problems.</p>

<p>Somethings I&#39;ve found:</p>

<p>We rarely learn anything when things are easy or go smoothly. We usually learn things when things go to shit and there is a hurdle to overcome, because in overcoming that hurdle we change something about how we act, or what we believe, or we learn a new skill.</p>

<p>It&#39;s good to keep in mind that <em>eventually</em> (a day / week / month / whatever) you know you will be OK. As time goes by you get better at directing the flow of that energy inside, choosing to feed a creative happy life instead of perhaps a spiral of doubt and negativity. It&#39;s something that takes time to learn. But it can be learned. Easy to give up... but these things take time.</p>

<p>So you know you will get there eventually, if you keep working at it :)</p>

<p>That means you don&#39;t have to worry about it. You&#39;ll get there. No need to stress or worry about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a conspiracy because it&#39;s hidden in plain sight, a group of people are conspiring to keep the connection silent. Bunches of examples of this, <a href="https://www.madinamerica.com/2013/09/connecticut-resisting-release-adam-lanza-medical-records/">Adam Lanza&#39;s a good one</a>, as the Connecticut AAG kept back his records not because of HIPAA, but because releasing those records could &#39;cause a lot of people to stop taking their medications&quot;.</p>

<p>There was just an excellent walk-through of how this happens, how side effects are covered up and dangerous drugs are pushed on people, especially children and the elderly at <a href="http://highline.huffingtonpost.com">http://highline.huffingtonpost.com</a>. Because no one wants to talk about suicide/homicide, this walkthrough talks about how Janssen Pharmaceuticals (a division of Johnson &amp; Johnson) hid the prevalence of gynomastia (colloquially, man-boobs) as a side effect while spending billions of dollars to convince doctors and consumers to use the medication on populations strictly forbidden by the FDA - but this happens every day across the industry for a number of side effects, including suicidal and homicidal ideation, auditory and visual hallucinations, paranoia, body tics, etc.</p>

<p><a href="http://study329.org/">Study 329</a> is worth a read, too:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the early 2000s, based on Study 329, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) marketed Paxil (paroxetine) as safe and effective for children and adolescents when company executives were aware that a number of studies (all but Study 329 unpublished) had shown that the drug was no better than placebo and caused thought disturbance and suicidal behavior in some youngsters.</p>

<p>Your argument completely relies on a link of omission. A claim like &quot;The media is actively silencing the idea that psychiatric drugs contribute to school shootings,&quot; would require some serious evidence to the rational person, right? Your serious piece of evidence is that the media didn&#39;t mention it. Definitely not compelling, at least to me. That would be like me saying the media is trying to hide the fact that <a href="http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations">per capita cheese consumption contributes to the amount of people being strangled by bed sheets</a> because the media doesn&#39;t talk about it and they correlate at 94%. Similarly, you are saying that the media is trying to hide that psych meds might cause school shootings because they correlate at 90% and the media isn&#39;t talking about it. Just ridiculous</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the deal: Everyone up to the President of the United States knows the effect of these medications and their role in suicide and homicide in the US (talk to someone at the VA, hoo boy), but we will only talk to the American people about guns because we&#39;re afraid to upend the pharma money train apple cart.</p>

<p>Did you think about this one at all or did you just sort of say it? Because what you&#39;re trying to say here is that if gun companies lose millions upon millions of legal customers, they won&#39;t miss a beat. Does this make any sense? No. However, I might be inclined to believe it if you presented ANY EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER other than just your word. I&#39;m not  saying you need someone to be your mouth piece.

<p>For example? If you&#39;re gonna say that the pharmaceutical companies are controlling American politics, then you need to establish proof. It isn&#39;t changing the subject to raise a flaw in your logic and ask for a source. Because it wouldn&#39;t make any sense for pharmaceutical companies to be more of an entity in politics than organizations like the Carlyle group, for example. Their assets don&#39;t match up. So, if you want to make that claim, provide a source because the logic doesn&#39;t check out. You&#39;re framing this on me switching the subject when this is me asking for warrants to your claims</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why? Why can&#39;t you just have an authentic conversation about this subject?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why don&#39;t you make evidence-backed claims instead of assertions? </p>

<p>Edit: I would be okay with the arguments you&#39;re making if you actually explained why. First question: other than correlation which doesn&#39;t equate causation as demonstrated by the per capita cheese example, why do you think that this is a conspiracy? Because the only other thing you have mentioned has been that the media doesn&#39;t talk about it enough. </p>

<p>Edit 2: Here is a list of the crazy things you have said without providing evidence:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Everyone up to the President of the United States knows the effect of these medications and their role in suicide and homicide in the US</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How could you possibly know this when leading psychiatrists don&#39;t understand their role in homicide yet? Provide a source</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What was in the TPP re: NRA? Pretty sure the biggest stakeholders there were pharmaceuticals, agriculture firms, and Hollywood.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How do you know this? Source? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You could ban all guns in the United States and the gun manufacturers wouldn&#39;t miss a beat.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why? How? If they lose legal customers, why would it make sense that they would retain business? In addition, why wouldn&#39;t these massive (per what you said) pharmaceutical companies survive a hit?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not making any arguments that would require a source. &quot;Correlation does not equal&quot; is common knowledge, or at least I would hope so. Links of omission aren&#39;t compelling. If I said Leprechauns exists because the media doesn&#39;t talk about it, it wouldn&#39;t make any sense. So just because they&#39;re <em>not</em> talking about it makes them real? No way, and I don&#39;t need a scientist to prove that. You do a scientist to prove that losing millions of customers wouldn&#39;t harm guns and would harm phramaceuticals, but then go on to say pharmaceuticals play a bigger role in politics than gun companies. It doesn&#39;t make sense.</p>

<p>How do you know that there is an association, though? Tons of crazy things correlate all the time without meaning they have any association. For example, <a href="http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations">per capita cheese consumption correlates with the total number of people who die by getting tangled in their bed sheets</a> with a correlation of about 94% much higher than the 90% correlation of psych meds and school shootings.

<p>Obviously not. That&#39;s me providing an eerily similar example. You don&#39;t believe in per capita cheese affecting tangled sheets death for the same reasons I don&#39;t believe in psychiatric drugs not affecting school shootings. They might, but I don&#39;t have reason to believe so</p>

    <div class="md"><p>honestly it comes a no surprise that people who commit mass shootings are on antidepressants.  because OF FUCKING COURSE THEY ARE!!!!!!!!!!  these people are fucked in the head!!!!!!!  of course theyre on meds!!!!!!   the meds arent the cause of the violence, the sickness is!!  look, when someone who has mental health problems, it can take a year to 5 years to find a medication that works, and if they need multiple medications, it can take longer because of interactions.  its no surprise these people are on a host of medications, because they were all clear candidates for institutionalization. everyone seems to think that the meds cause such extreme behaviors because its one thing that all shooter have in common, never once mentioning that they were also all suffering from severe mental problems.  </p>

<p>and yes, i am aware of the side effects of SSRI&#39;s, MAOI&#39;s etc.  suicide, depression, exacerbation of symptoms, but there is no &quot;mass shooter pill&quot;.  as i said before, it can take years to find what works as each person is essentially their own island when it comes to mental health, and in the meantime they definitely have roadblocks along the way.  sometimes the symptoms will get worse due to medications being too much or not enough, lifestyle changes, personal changes etc, and suddenly a benign   patient is in a manic phase and walking down the street naked claiming to be the archangel Michael (its happened before where i live).  </p>

<p>i guess the point im trying to make here is that age old saying: correlation is not causation.  does mental health, especially in america, need to be reexamined?  hell the fuck yes it does because its still in the stone age compared to things like osteopathy or neurology.  but its the best we have.  maybe some day we&#39;ll figure all this out and every school campus will be safe one day.  but until then dont try to attack the people that are trying to help.</p>

<p>so you think i should read the &quot;little pieces of paper that comes with the pills&quot;?  thats nice.  real nice.  i used to be a pysch nurse, and im still an in home nurse with a very mild psych patient.  homie, ive read more info on psych meds than most people on this forum ever will.  ive treated more psych patients then most people reading this.  ive seen them work.  ive seen them go horribly wrong.  as i said earlier, there is no mass shooter pill.  yes medications can make symptoms worse, but that is not the aim of them.  its easy to sit back and say there is an obvious connection, but you have never worked with this section of the population.  i guess the only reason i weighing into this topic is because i know it to be misled as a medical professional.  i have years of experience so i can speak with authority.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah youre right it is a well documented connection.  its so well documented it even says so in the information leaflet that comes with the medicines.  symptoms like suicidal ideation or violent urges are well documented, but are considered severe in less than 1% when taken correctly.<br/>
im not spreading mistruths here, im spreading the truth as i know it.  what motivating me is i can tell people are illinformed on the subject and it happens to be my field of study.<br/>
reading studies is good.  its good to be educated on subjects like this, as it concerns your health.  let he who can, read.  but, the difference between reading and understanding is apparent here.  </p>

<p>some assume that the meds causes people to go on mass shootings, but show me one mass shooter pill.  as i said earlier, it can take years before a treatment that works is found.  and between then theres all the therapy, treatments, lapses in judgement or even institutionalization.  most people give up and that makes it worse as they just stop taking all their meds and it has an awful effect on them, but who could blame them?!  </p>

<p>you said one day i decide to help people?  motherfucker, did you read a word of anything ive said?!!??  ive been doing it for years!!  </p>

<p>look, im no doctor, im just a nurse.  and the subject of psychological health is a surprisingly complicated one.  i understand why it looks bad that all these shooters are on all these prescription medications.  but youre not taking into account that they were on medications because they could potentially be mass shooters.  if 1000 drug dealers are caught selling cocaine in ziplock baggies, should we investigate the makers of ziplock baggies?  of course we shouldnt, everyone knows cocaine and ziplock baggies are like peas and carrots.  if somone goes and shoots up a school, clearly they needed help long before the event occurred, and a list of medications and therapy sessions are evidence of a prior problem  that they are trying to alleviate.  SSRI&#39;s, MAOI&#39;s lithium, or whatever is of course going to be present.<br/>
im not saying that these medications did not make it more likely that this would happen, its very possible it could have.  but as shitty as it is to say, thats the nature of the business.  you dont really know what effect a treatment will have until its already done.    </p>
