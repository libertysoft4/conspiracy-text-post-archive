<blockquote>
<p>If you look at the start of the collapse of the North Tower, the first thing to move is the antenna. The antenna was supported on the hat truss which capped the 47 core columns. For the antenna to move downward, along with the roofline, from the very outset, tells us that all 47 core columns were cut. Since the roofline descends straight down, remaining nearly level (within a few degrees) the cutting of the columns must have been synchronized. The top block is the first part of the building to be destroyed. It is about half gone by the time the top section, as a whole, starts moving down the building. </p>

<p>Dave Thomas asserts that I fail to grasp that a falling block should deliver a &quot;dynamic load&quot; in addition to the static load. I am fully aware of the concept of dynamic load. The problem with that argument is that yes, that&#39;s what one would expect, but that is not what is observed. Dynamic load arises from the rate of change of momentum. In order to deliver an excess force the falling block would need to lose some of its momentum, in other words slow down. Since the roofline is experiencing uniform downward acceleration, the top block is not losing momentum at all, so it cannot deliver an excess force. The measurement of the actual motion proves that it is not crushing the underlying structure at all. It is falling into a void as the underlying structure is being pulverized by other forces.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>excuse me private but can you please restate your question in clear and logical manner? You sound like a robot who&#39;s asking a question with no answer. How could columns be &quot;still standing&quot; if you yourself admit &quot;the floors had collapsed all the way to the ground&quot;? 
I&#39;ll give you the benefit of doubt and infer you meant: in the course of the demolition why were the central core columns demolished after the peripheral columns that lined the outer circumference of the core?

<p>But we know for a fact that isn&#39;t true. The core columns of both buildings stood for 15 or 20 seconds after the collapsing floors had reached the ground. </p>

<p>So whatever happened to those floors had nothing at all to do with cutting core columns, since they weren&#39;t cut. </p>

<p>I agree about half of the core columns stood for 15-20 seconds, but only from about the 60th floor down and only the internal 19 columns not all 47. For why I believe that, watch the presentation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The steel wreckage is bent in such a way that indicates the floors were severed from the core by explosives at the hat trusses. These trusses were connected to the outer wall of the building and the outer columns of the core. In order to demolish the floors those two sets of columns had to be demolished. There was a moment during the demolition when all of the floors had been blown, and consequently the outer core columns, but the interior core columns had not been blown yet. That&#39;s how some of the core columns were standing for 15-20 after the rest of the floors already hit the ground. At the end of the demo the last charges in the interior of the core were ignited and the core came down. </p>

<p><strong>Bullshit</strong></p>

<p>I just spent 5 minutes examining this claim, and every valid site I can find lists &quot;Chemical Pollutants&quot; (or similar wording) as a strong factor in the increased risk of thyroid cancer.</p>

<p>Oh look, your own link refutes your ONLY RADIATION claim</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some risk factors, <strong>like smoking</strong>, can be changed. Others, like a person’s age or family history, can’t be changed.</p>

<p>Beyond that all of these sites state that <em>no one knows what causes it exactly</em>.</p>

<p><a href="http://consults.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/21/toxins-genes-and-thyroid-cancer/">Here&#39;s a quote from a Q&amp;A with a doctor</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can Environmental Toxins Cause Thyroid Cancer?</p>

<p>A.Dr. Tuttle responds:</p>

<p>Most of the time we don’t know what causes a specific patient’s thyroid cancer. The only well-accepted risk factor for the common types of thyroid cancer — papillary and follicular thyroid cancers — is exposure to ionizing radiation that occurs after exposure to fallout from nuclear reactors (like that following the Chernobyl accident), atomic bombs or therapeutic uses of radiation during young childhood.</p>

<p>However, since the incidence of thyroid cancer has dramatically increased over the last 20 years, both in the United States and abroad, many investigators are re-examining the possibility that some environmental factor may be linked to the rise in thyroid cancer. But as of now, no specific chemical or environmental factor has been demonstrated to commonly cause thyroid cancer in humans.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh look! <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2935336/">More info that it isn&#39;t <em>just radiation</em> and could have been related to the <strong>metric fuckton</strong> of cancer causing agents in the pyroclastic dust cloud that enveloped the city!</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Summary</p>

<p>Factors that increase autoimmune thyroid disease risk include radiation exposure, both from nuclear fallout and medical radiation, increased iodine intake, <strong>as well as several contaminants in the environment that influence the thyroid</strong>. Although ∼70% of the risk for developing autoimmune thyroid disease is attributable to genetic background, environmental triggers are thought to play a role in the development of autoimmune thyroid disease in susceptible individuals.</p>

<p>Conclusions</p>

<p>Understanding the association of environmental agents with thyroid dysfunction can be utilized to reduce the risk to populations. Knowledge of the specific factors that trigger autoimmune thyroid disease and their mode of action, however, may also inform risk reduction in the individual patient. These factors are especially relevant for those at increased risk of autoimmune thyroid disease based on family history.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess you missed all the bits about chemical and other contaminants being possible causes since other than radiation, no one is sure exactly what causes it, and yet it is rising.</p>

<p>That&#39;s ok, I would ignore that part of my argument too if I was trying to pretend that I knew exactly how exposing my body to the personalized particulate of a demolished building/organic mater is going to impact the FRs cancer-wise.</p>

<p>But please, do continue to talk down to me and ignore large swaths of my argument to fit your narrow view of the events.</p>

<p>So lets establish the parameters of our arguments here</p>

<p><strong>You</strong>:
-Only radiation causes thyroid cancer (ok and some genetics), therefore nukes at ground zero. </p>

<p>-Other than this, you have nothing to back your claim up</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong>:
-No one knows exactly what causes it</p>

<p>-For sure radiation <em>can</em></p>

<p>-Probably loads of other contaminants and hazardous things <em>such as FRs were exposed to at ground zero</em></p>

<p>-Smoking is likely to increase chances too</p>

<p>-Not everyone who gets thryroid cancer is exposed to radiation/enough radiation to be thought to cause thyroid cancer</p>

<p>I&#39;m getting pretty bored of talking in circles with you here guy, so until you can show me evidence that the FRs were exposed to radiation other than a correlation between radiation and thyroid cancer risk vs. increase in thyroid cancer among FRs I&#39;m resting my case, because this proves nothing.</p>

<p>Given that the bullshit they were exposed to is highly toxic, and I provided more than enough link info to back up the fact that radiation <strong>and</strong> likely environmental chemical/pollutants/toxins/etc. (and genetics) are the likely causes of TC, your argument has nothing to stand on.  </p>

<p>You have built and burned several strawmen, distorted my argument, attempted to talk down to me as if I don&#39;t know the difference between lungs and the thyroid to dissuade anyone reading this from actually internalizing my argument, and have just generally been aggressive and toxic, hell one of your posts got deleted because you went all out and started accusing me of being a shill, which is hilarious frankly.</p>

<p>I firmly believe that anyone who has managed to lurk through all this back and forth we have had will come to the same conclusions I did upon reading what you posted and engaging with you. </p>

I just don&#39;t see the mini-nuke thing.</p>

<p>Mini-nukes would not be adequate -- although they&#39;re commonly used in <a href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/2013/09/02/thoughts-on-mini-nukes-theory-in-regard-to-nuclear-demolition-of-the-world-trade-center/">other false flags</a>. We&#39;re talking a 150kt thermonuclear detonation device under each building.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm well do post it up if ever come across it... like... ever. I&#39;m super interested in how thermite can produce Iodine-131, because frankly, no it can&#39;t -- a simple <a href="https://startpage.com/do/search?query=i-131+thermite">Google search</a> can confirm that the two have nothing to do with each other.</p>

<p>Why would you lie so openly? Why? When you lie so obviously, it really makes us question AE911Truth -- if it takes open deception to support the thermite-alone theory, it&#39;s fairly clear that there&#39;s something wrong with the theory... and, by extension, the AE911Truth organization.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an excellent, well-researched and referenced book on the nuclear demolition topic if you care to dig deeper:</p>

<p>Then as an example you stated: </p>

<p>Environment for example. </p>

<p>So is your assertion that there is a lot of propaganda on which side of the global warning argument.</p>

<p>Do you belivee the propaganda supports the proposition that global is real and man js contributing a lot to it</p>

<p>Or is the propaganda on the other side?</p>

<p>Please be specific </p>
