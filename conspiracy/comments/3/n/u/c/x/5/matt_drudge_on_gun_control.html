Have no security around you; have no guns around you, Hillary. I dare you. I dare you. Obama, same thing. Drop your guns, Obama. Take your Secret Service away, Obama. Take it all away. Leave the White House unguarded, Obama. Let everybody know there’s no guns on the White House grounds, Obama. You know what would happen in 30 seconds? Both of those people would no longer be on Planet Earth. So they’re asking us to drop our guns and to drop our security measures, or–or what? So, this thing is very real, and I don’t see how it’s being taken seriously, except for the sick voter. You can’t underestimate the sickness of the American people right now. They’re really sick. I’m more angry at the sick Americans than I am at Obama or Hillary. I’m really angry at the sick Americans.”</p>

<p>Why do so many progressive policies seem aimed at returning us to this state?  Taxes to resume serfdom, regulations to resume cartels, gun laws to resume the divine right of kings.  How long until leftists are arguing for the resumption of first night rights?</p>

It&#39;s difficult to claim that 15 billion dollar a year industry, that has lobbying power and can recruit voters so readily is a true victim. Yes indeed politicians want to restrict guns but the fact that they can&#39;t seem to make any serious headway suggests to me that this is just politics. Which I don&#39;t think belongs in this sub. </p>

<p>Really? There is a conspiracy that the government wants to regulate who own guns. That means is a conspiracy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Second Amendment had become obsolete by the twentieth century, gun manufacturers gave it a new lease on life as the universal license for virtually all adults to purchase weapons for themselves and indeed even their children. This was clearly not the &quot;well regulated militia&quot; the Founders had in mind, especially since the founders were all members of the commercial elite, which was exceedingly wary of the larger populace and hence of direct and popular democracy. They  would of course not have approved of every common individual having access to fearsome weaponry singularly capable of killing dozens within mere fractions of an hour.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can&#39;t we just accept that the founding fathers weren&#39;t heros? They were rich men who wanted control, just like any king/baron/politician. How many of those living throughout the country before them wanted a state?</p>

<p>Control is bad. Controlling other people always leads to open doors that cause suffering. Controlling guns will not prevent anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s really a fair comparison (President of the U.S. vs some bloak on the couch).. not to mention, they aren&#39;t advocating removing guns all together (yet), just stricter control. </p>

<p>For the record, I agree with stricter background checks and the closing of loop holes, but beyond that.. we have the amendment in there for a reason. And that reason has never been more valid than it is today. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason we have that amendment is no longer relevant because we have a permanent federal army. We no longer need to rely on state militias to protect us from the natives and to round up runaway slaves. Now we interpret the amendment to mean something different than what James Madison intended when he chose which of the proposed clauses to include in it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Supreme Court is in charge of interpreting the Constitution. They say otherwise:  </p>

<p>&quot;The court then held that the Second Amendment &quot;protects an individual right to keep and bear arms&quot;, saying that the right was &quot;premised on the private use of arms for activities such as hunting and self-defense, the latter being understood as <strong>resistance to</strong> either private lawlessness or <strong>the depredations of a tyrannical government (or a threat from abroad</strong>).&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;In a dissenting opinion, Justice John Paul Stevens stated that the court&#39;s judgment was &quot;a strained and unpersuasive reading&quot; which overturned longstanding precedent, and that the court had &quot;bestowed a dramatic upheaval in the law&quot;.[51] Stevens also stated that the amendment was notable for the &quot;omission of any statement of purpose related to the right to use firearms for hunting or personal self-defense&quot; which was present in the Declarations of Rights of Pennsylvania and Vermont.[51]</p>

<p>The Stevens dissent seems to rest on four main points of disagreement: that the Founders would have made the individual right aspect of the Second Amendment express if that was what was intended; that the &quot;militia&quot; preamble and exact phrase &quot;to keep and bear arms&quot; demands the conclusion that the Second Amendment touches on state militia service only; that many lower courts&#39; later &quot;collective-right&quot; reading of the Miller decision constitutes stare decisis, which may only be overturned at great peril; and that the Court has not considered gun-control laws (e.g., the National Firearms Act) unconstitutional. The dissent concludes, &quot;The Court would have us believe that over 200 years ago, the Framers made a choice to limit the tools available to elected officials wishing to regulate civilian uses of weapons.... I could not possibly conclude that the Framers made such a choice.&quot;</p>

<p>Justice Stevens&#39; dissent was joined by Justices David Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen Breyer.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;ve read both Scalia&#39;s opinion and Stevens&#39; dissent on this case. They are both fascinating but Stevens has a way better argument that is rooted in actual history.</p>
