        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">347</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2015-10-05 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/KnightBeforeTomorrow.html">KnightBeforeTomorrow</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have the most controversial opinion around about what happened at the Pentagon but I also have  some rare evidence to back it up.</p>

<p>The first call to 911 on 9/11 was from a lady who said that a helicopter had gone around the Pentagon and fired a missile at it.</p>

<p>Assume with me for a moment that the first report, before the spin doctors could change or block it, was correct and that a helicopter had gone to a predesignated position below eye level, in front of the bridge abutment at the expressway, at the edge of the lawn and fired a missile out of sight of traffic and witnesses.</p>

<p>The reason they would do this would be to get rid of all the evidence and the personnel that were working on that evidence in the disappearance of the 2.3 trillion dollars. To make sure that nothing was missed, or hit accidentally, the personnel inside the Pentagon needed a visual marker to show them where the attack would come form so they could place people and computers in the line of fire. Nothing could be left to chance.</p>

<p>The necessary visual marker should be visible from inside the Pentagon and from outside so that no one &#39;in the loop&#39; could become confused and also as I said in a position where there would be no witnesses.</p>

<p>Such a marker was indeed placed on the lawn to indicate where the computers and accountants should be and where the heli. should position itself, where it should hover and in which direction it would be firing.</p>

<p>It should be seen from inside and from outside but what the planners may not have realized was that it could even be seen from a satellite. Such a marker was indeed photographed by Space Imaging Corp. on the 7th of September 2001. I found it by doing a google image search soon after the attacks. Another such image was made on the 15th.</p>

<p>Here is the full image of the lawn marking.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/cYz2L">http://imgur.com/cYz2L</a></p>

<p>and here is a close up I created from it. <a href="http://imgur.com/e4gFq">http://imgur.com/e4gFq</a></p>

<p>A few working hours after the attack the lawn marking was aggressively covered up.</p>

<p>The coverup of the mark <a href="http://imgur.com/FXHKreH">http://imgur.com/FXHKreH</a></p>

<p>I say it&#39;s controversial because at every mention online I suddenly get fucked with by some unknown entity or heavily brigaded and have in fact suffered a blue screen after I wrote all of this out for you the first time. I&#39;ll try to get screen shots with my camera if it happens again.</p>

<p>I value all opinions about this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to say at the outset that I didn&#39;t think to get a copy of the Washington newspaper article published within a month of 9/11 that included the story of the first 9/11 call. I can&#39;t find it now so long afterwards and I solicit the help of anyone interested in finding it. I have  a list of those killed and they do seem to be the accounting department looking into the missing trillions. When you are talking about trillions of dollars there is no limit as to the skulduggery that would be allowed in order to get control of the situation.</p>

<p>Following money may have had something to do with it, but this was a unit of the army that went after <em>really</em> bad people/rogue factions who have the means and resources to carry out something like...the events of 911?</p>

<p>Follow his link: <a href="http://stateofthenation2012.com/?p=7858">http://stateofthenation2012.com/?p=7858</a></p>

<p>Now find the part where it says: <strong>&quot;<em>Veterans Today</em> Radio Interview on 9-22-14 With Gordon Duff, Jim Fetzer, Preston James And Stew Webb&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Then at 55:34 in that video it makes the baseless assertion that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On 9/11 the destroyed Pentagon offices contained a small G2 Unit [US Army G2 Branch Responsible for Intelligence and Security]; a highly classified Criminal Investigation Service. </p>

<p>He provided this as evidence to bolster other unsourced assertions that the people who died were naval intelligence. It was pretty far up the thread so you&#39;ll have to concentrate if you want to get to the bottom of this. </p>

<p>Now please explain how I am daft and you are not a moron. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not asking anybody to do my research for me. I&#39;ve done plenty of research about this. I&#39;m one of the few people on this forum to have actually <a href="http://www.dodig.mil/audit/reports/fy00/00-179.pdf">read the inspector general&#39;s audit report</a> where $2.3 trillion dollar figure came from. I&#39;ve read <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100301161721/http://www.defense.gov/speeches/speech.aspx?speechid=430">Rumsfeld&#39;s speech on 9/10/2001</a> where he briefly mentions those transactions--not an announcement since they were <a href="http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20010103&amp;amp;slug=pent03">known publicly before Rumsfeld even took office</a> and in fact, he was <a href="http://www.c-span.org/video/?c4521969/sen-byrd-rumsfeld-nominatin-hearing">asked to look into them at his confirmation hearings</a>.</p>

<p>But what does the research matter if people just make stuff up like &quot;the accounting records were in the part of the Pentagon that was destroyed&quot; or even &quot;the records were in the basement of WTC7&quot;! Or &quot;the accountants who were killed in the Pentagon were investigating the missing 2.3 trillion dollars.&quot; Not true, but that one is at least plausible. This is the first time I&#39;ve heard that the Office of Naval Intelligence was investigating that, which doesn&#39;t even make sense. People just repeat these things over and over.</p>

<p>The office of naval intelligence wasn&#39;t investigating that, they were investigating something else. If you want somewhere to start and something new for you to look into, a great place to start is the video &#39;9/11 conspiracy solved&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>the financial accounting office </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You think that the Department of Defense has one financial accounting office that fits in a little corner of the Pentagon? The main accounting group in the Department of Defense is DFAS - the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Finance_and_Accounting_Service">Defense Finance and Accounting Service</a>. It has <strong>12,000</strong> employees and locations all over the world. The largest part of the &quot;$2.3 trillion&quot; had to do with transactions between the Kansas City and Cleveland DFAS offices, copying data from the Marine Corps ledger to the Navy ledger. Neither DFAS, nor the two groups that were responsible for investigating these transactions--the Inspector General and the Office of the Comptroller--suffered any losses on 9/11. There were a number of accountants killed, but they worked for a small office called Resource Services Washington, which had nothing to do with investigating DFAS.</p>

<p>The story about &quot;off-site backups&quot; at WTC is completely fabricated. DFAS has multiple redundancy in their own systems, plus they have to send records to the National Archives and Records Administration. NARA is <em>not</em> located in the World Trade Center. It has its own dedicated warehouses and salt mines to store records, not expensive Manhattan real estate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A skeptic is also skeptical about things that support their views. You are not a skeptic. You haven&#39;t done any investigating on your own. You&#39;ve read through conspiracy sources that handed you the info and you sucked it in without second guessing it. Probably haven&#39;t even done something as simple as wikipeding something you didn&#39;t understand . There is so many glaringly obvious holes in this post any actual skeptic would see immediately.</p>

<p>1) People look up when they see helicopters, yet a missile loaded helicopter got all the way to the pentagon in the center of a city unseen? </p>

<p>2) A pilot trained enough to fly an assault chopper, on probably the most sensitive mission a helicopter pilot has ever flown, wouldn&#39;t need a line in dirt to hit a spot on such a well known building.</p>

<p>3)Neither would the people on the inside. It&#39;s a center office on the ground floor not a maze.</p>

<p>4)Apart from bunker busters, missiles explode on impact and don&#39;t blow circular holes directly forward. They explode in every direction. Bunker busters which are designed to penetrate concrete before detonation explode after penetration, obviously. Meaning the area after the last hole would be absolutely fucked. Yet it&#39;s not.</p>

<p>5)It&#39;s spelled skeptic for fucks sake.</p>

In my opinion, you have debunked his proposed theory. I am convinced by your arguments. This is what should happen.
If someone proposes a theory which they formed themself, it should be argued with in a civil manner if it&#39;s probable or not. But not outright ridiculed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is interesting, a bit.  That&#39;s just me.  The problem is more about the plane.  </p>

<p>I tie this in because we know Norman Mineta talks and mentions in his 9/11 commission testimony that Dick Cheney had a &quot;young man&quot; come in and inform him that the plane was 50 miles out and every 10 miles as it came in.  With him asking if an order still stood.  That order was obviously NOT to shoot down said plane.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know about a helicopter but the plane issue, along with a damage path that DOES NOT line up with those who witnessed it, is more critical than a mention of a helicopter.</p>

<p>The plane was witnessed, the explosion happened and a plane was seen traveling away from the building.  The event seems to be centered around this detail and not a helicopter.  None of these witnesses talk about a helicopter.  They all saw a plane.</p>

<p>That and we know if they blew up the building intentionally, a helicopter would not be used for that purpose, nor to distract from it.  Don&#39;t you think?</p>

<p>What would help this would be if this persons testimony could be attributed to a particular time.  If you can find that out, we will know if it is relevant or not.</p>

<p>The link and information I provided about the helicopter is all I&#39;ve got on helicopters at the Pentagon. Though, I found out Dick Cheney was told a helicopter coming toward the White House. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What did make it into the 9/11 commission report is about a plane.  Since we&#39;re dealing with planes, how about we address that?  Planes were seen and obviously the place was blown up.  There are zero <em>credible</em> sources for a helicopter shooting a missile.  Even the control tower operator Sean Boger didn&#39;t mention any such thing.  Dick Cheney and what he says can&#39;t be taken seriously at all, so I have to question where you&#39;re going with this.</p>

<p>Can you tell me what keeps you going on such a small and likely irrelevant detail like this one, even if it were true?  The damage path could not be caused by a helicopter.  It was supposedly caused by a plane, that detail is impossible given what people saw with the plane and where it was seen.  You yourself said all of those witnesses and their testimony is compelling.  Yet, you&#39;re over in left field waving your arms and smoke and conjecture!</p>

<p>How can you possible keep on this witch hunt?  That&#39;s what this is.  I question your motives when it comes to this, but that&#39;s just me.</p>

<p>Not saying it DID happen. Just that rigging such a thing isnt that hard for special ops.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>An AIM-54 is air-to-air. There is no helicopter capable of firing it. Furthermore, there is no perpetrator variant that would be necessary to pierce the reinforced concrete of the Pentagon, little less to cause a &quot;cosmetic breach hole&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s... really not much damage. It&#39;s just a collapsed wall and a few fires. Hellfires or TOWs could easily do that kind of damage, maybe with 2. I don&#39;t know what makes you so qualified, all you do is yell HELICOPTER MISSILES CAN&#39;T DO THAT NOPE without providing any argument or evidence. There&#39;s absolutely no reason a hellfire couldn&#39;t do that kind of damage, it can probably level a weaker but bigger building easily. You haven&#39;t provided one iota of proof that a plane is needed to knock over a wall and catch a building on fire. Furthermore, the plane did alledgedly did this damage whilst not leaving any debris or damage in the lawn despite every single report saying the plane hit the lawn first. Without any part breaking off, huh. Seems logical. </p>

<p>Again you don&#39;t think an 800 pound explosive can do that kind of damage? You are either an idiot, or a troll. Telling by the childish way you debate, I&#39;m assuming a troll at this point. The few missiles I listed were examples of weapons used to destroy enormous ships and aircraft carriers. I didn&#39;t even look through the 50+ different helicopter based payloads. </p>

<p>PENTAGON RADIATION LEVELS</p>

<p>Around the Pentagon there were reports of high radiation levels after 9-11. American Free Press has documentation that radiation levels in Alexandria and Leesburg, Va., were much higher than usual on 9-11 and persisted for at least one week afterward.</p>

<p>In Alexandria, seven miles south of the burning Pentagon, a doctor with years of experience working with radiation issues found elevated radiation levels on 9-11 of 35 to 52 counts per minute (cpm) using a “Radalert 50” Geiger counter.</p>

<p>One week after 9-11, in Leesburg, 33 miles northwest of the Pentagon, soil readings taken in a residential neighborhood showed even higher readings of 75 to 83 cpm.</p>

Can it be confirmed that the area of the pentagon that was struck was the area that they were using to conduct an investigation into the lost trillions?Also i noticed from the photo that this side of the building had the least amount of public access. However, can i suggest that there may have been a reason a woman had seen a helicopter in the vicinity and that was it had something to do with the helipad directly adjacent the strike zone. Do you think the mark on the ground could be seen by a drone? Someone here provided an interesting link not to long ago where they also did an analysis of the strike footage and suggested that it was a type of drone that has been unaccounted for. I think your argument and the drone argument are both very plausible.</p>

I could have just been an old Air Force jet that was remotely controlled or a cruise missile like a tomahawk. I could see how you could mix up a jet and a tomahawk missile. </p>

<p>The other tower had already been hit by that point, so it would make sense that an extra helicopter might have been deployed around the pentagon due to fears of another attack at the pentagon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you saw a mark on the lawn and then formed all this back from that on the basis that somehow a scuffed lawn is the marker that would be necessary to correctly place employees and equipment in harms way?

<p>The people killed in the Pentagon had nothing to do with the &quot;missing trillions&quot; - the accountants and budget analysts worked for the Army&#39;s Resource Services. They were responsible for some small amount of Army spending. They did not work for the wider DoD and certainly not for Defense Finance and Accounting Services who were most likely responsible for that.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve not heard of this 911 call and couldn&#39;t immediately find any mention of it, although I do know that some witnesses mentioned a helicopter landing on the <em>helipad</em> at the Pentagon before the crash.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve answered this in a previous thread, but what I believe why he announced this the day before he shredded the evidence, is either is A. Extremely bad at cover-ups, evident by his piss poor cover-up of the WTC 7 building, mentioning he didn&#39;t even know what it was even though the company that took up 37 of the 47 floors of the tower took a massive beat down from the collapse, including chairman of the International Advisory Board of the company, Donald Rumsfeld himself, B. He didn&#39;t know the attack would be on that day, evident by the fact that he was present in the Pentagon when it struck, and also his lack of the deployment of the air force on that day, or C., the most likely, $2.3 trillion is a fuckton of money. After at least a week, people would figure out that $2.3 trillion was mysteriously lost <em>the day before</em> 9/11, and that Donald Rumsfeld knew about the money but decided not to speak. That would give him a higher chance of putting him in legal trouble, and once people see that a federal agent is being put on trial for negligence, all the conspirators are in deep shit.</p>

<p>Do you actually think it&#39;s believable that someone could be so bad at coverups that they would destroy the evidence 24 hours after announcing the existence of the problem in the first place? That&#39;s cartoonish.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>B. He didn&#39;t know the attack would be on that day, evident by the fact that he was present in the Pentagon when it struck</p>

<p>If Rumsfeld did not order the coverup than who did? Because even if he didn&#39;t know the exact date and time of the attack he still made a decision to go public with the accounting issue with the knowledge that the evidence would be destroyed. Which brings us back to issue A - which requires inconceivable levels of stupidity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>C., the most likely, $2.3 trillion is a fuckton of money. After at least a week, people would figure out that $2.3 trillion was mysteriously lost the day before 9/11</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a fundamental misunderstanding of what was announced on 9/10. Rumsfeld did not announce that 2.3 Trillion dollars went missing on a specific day. He announced that the Pentagon was not able to adequately track 2.3 Trillion in spending - spending that occurred over a period of years. So it didn&#39;t just up an vanish. More specifically it didn&#39;t even necessarily go missing. It&#39;s more like the Pentagon could not find all the receipts (but that&#39;s actually neither here nor there when thinking about why someone would announce a &quot;scandal&quot; hours before blowing up the evidence).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That would give him a higher chance of putting him in legal trouble, and once people see that a federal agent is being put on trial for negligence, all the conspirators are in deep shit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If we consider the announcement Rumsfeld made to be admission of a crime and that 9/11 was an attempt to destroy the evidence then we once again get to issue A. If destroying the evidence is sufficient to get Rumsfeld off the hook then why admit to the crime before destroying the evidence? </p>

<p>No. It&#39;s not that it&#39;s suspicious. It&#39;s that it&#39;s objectively pointless. If the attacks really were staged to destroy the evidence then there is literally no reason to announce the scandal for which the evidence will be destroyed. In the absence of Rumsfelds announcement it is unlikely we would even be discussing this which would have made the coverup that much more successful. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;ve gotta be kidding me... Is that a real question?</p>

<p>Yes. The poster above me suggested that the reason the attacks occurred when they did (post announcement) was that Rumsfeld was not aware of when the attack would happen. The rest of his posts suggests that the attacks were done at Rumsfeld&#39;s behest. I was simply inquiring as to who would be coordinating the attack if not Rumsfeld. Obviously you could pick any number of people. I&#39;m just curious who he thinks did it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>None of which explain why whoever <em>was</em> in charge would instruct Rumsfeld to go public with the scandal only to destroy the evidence one day later. </p>

<p>Except that&#39;s actually moronic and does nothing to justify announcing it. This isn&#39;t the &quot;big lie&quot; or &quot;hiding in plain sight&quot;, they aren&#39;t pretending that something is different than what we all know it to be (like Russia claiming troops are volunteers or the United States insisting Iraq had WMD) its revealing something no one knew about only to allegedly try and cover it up the next day. The circular logic of &quot;it&#39;s so crazy on one would think it was true so we&#39;ll say it&quot; is irrelevant because if they never said it we&#39;d never have heard about it (because they blew everyone up).</p>

<p>You&#39;re just wrong to assume that. It could have been perfectly logical to announce it. The investigation was already well underway.

<p>You&#39;re making an ignorant assumption that nobody would ever know about it at all if it weren&#39;t announced at that time. Destroying the paper-trail doesn&#39;t remove the investigation from history.</p>

<p>For all you know it didn&#39;t make any difference to announce it before or after, or any other number of possible situations that result in an announcement seeming ideal. Your assumption is flawed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s not just that, he already responded to you about the trillions missing that the financial accounting office would have had the records on - which is another office right in front of what got hit that morning.</p>

<p>there was also a case of $243 billion or so in securities that were cleared immediately after sept. 11 (without thee normal legal process of ownership checks and authenticity checks because the fed and SEC declared an emergency and eased the restrictions normally governing the maturation of securities) that were part of an ongoing money laundering investigation that the El Dorado Task Force and the Office of Naval Intelligence was part of - can you guess which command in the pentagon had the most casualties? The Office of Naval Intelligence lost something like 90% of their people in the office that morning. Can you guess where the entirety of the offices for the El Dorado Task Force (an interagency money laundering investigations unit for the US) was located? In the world trade center.</p>

<p>can you guess where the ONLY off-site backups storing the financial records of the Pentagon were kept? In a secure federal office suite in Building 7 at the WTC complex.</p>

<p>So let&#39;s recap, 2.3 trillion, 240 billion, all the records vanishing into puffs of smoke in a period of 5 hours or less and all the people investigating having their commands cut off - and a perfect scapegoat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>2.3 trillion was the estimated sum which the Pentagon could not account for due to issues with it&#39;s multitude of accounting systems and frankly lax standards. </p>

<p>Here is the actual speech given by Rumsfeld on 9/10/01: <a href="http://library.rumsfeld.com/doclib/sp/1478/2001-09-10%20to%20George%20W%20Bush%20re%20Waste%20to%20Warfighting-%20Memo%20Attachment.pdf#search=%22pentagon">http://library.rumsfeld.com/doclib/sp/1478/2001-09-10%20to%20George%20W%20Bush%20re%20Waste%20to%20Warfighting-%20Memo%20Attachment.pdf#search=&quot;pentagon</a> bureaucracy&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The technology revolution has transformed organizations across the private sector, but not ours, not
fully, not yet. We are, as they say, tangled in our anchor chain. Our financial systems are decades old.
According to some estimates, we cannot track $2.3 trillion in transactions. We canuot share
information from floor to floor in this building because it’s stored on dozens of technological systems
that are inaccessible or incompatible.
We maintain 20 to 25 percent more base infrastructure than we need to support our forces, at an annual
waste to taxpayers of some $3 billion to $4 billion. Fully half of our resources go to infrastructure and
overhead, and in addition to draining resources from warfighting, these costly and outdated systems,
procedures and programs stifle innovation as well. A new idea must often survive the gauntlet of some
17 levels of bureaucracy to make it from a line officer’s to my desk. I have too much respect for a line
officer to believe that we need 17 layers between us.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We have committed $100 million for financial modernization, and we’re establishing a Defense
Business Board to tap outside expertise as we move to improve the department’s business practices.&quot;</p>

<p>In short, the Pentagon is godawful about keeping track of what it spends its money on, in part because it wastes that money with reckless abandon: <a href="http://fcnl.org/issues/budget/Waste_Dollars_in_the_Pentagon_Budget.pdf">http://fcnl.org/issues/budget/Waste_Dollars_in_the_Pentagon_Budget.pdf</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you are onto something with this.  Nice work.  To me it&#39;s always been obvious that the missing trillions were the real story at the Pentagon and that a plane never hit it <strong>but</strong> a missile fired from miles and miles away leaves all sorts of risks like: will it get seen on the way there?  Will it have an error or accident before it reaches its destination?  Will it get spotted on satellite or radar from some other entity?  Will it strike in exactly the correct spot?  Will the people &quot;in the know&quot; know where it&#39;s going to hit?  All of these scenarios are totally unacceptable here because there were <strong>trillions</strong> of dollars missing.  This was no time for fucking around, those offices needed to be destroyed and those people investigating needed to be killed.</p>

<p>All of these issues are solved instantly by having the missile fired from a helicopter right outside the building with a clear marker on the ground for all in the know.  There might&#39;ve been some room for chance with the other planes/buildings, but not with the missing trillions at the Pentagon (the same can be said for WTC7 which was brought down even without being hit by a plane - obviously it was very important that <em>it</em> was destroyed too).</p>

<p>The money had been spent, but information regarding the expenditures was spread across multiple incompatible accounting systems and could not be properly itemized for audits and accountability. The 2.3 trillion sum was the accumulated sum that they couldn&#39;t properly track. It didn&#39;t go missing like it was stolen. Undoubtedly much of it was wasted with the flagrant lack of fiscal responsibility the Pentagon and its private contractors routinely display, but that is a known issue which was hardly threatened by the investigation.</p>

<p>The investigation into the Pentagon&#39;s accounting continued after 9/11.</p>

<p>How can something be &quot;missing&quot; without being &quot;misplaced or stolen&quot;?  Explain that to me.  Where did the money go if it wasn&#39;t &quot;misplaced&quot; or &quot;stolen&quot;?  Just vanished into thin air in your opinion?</p>

<p>Do you not realize that &quot;We have absolutely no idea what happened to this 2.3 trillion dollars or how it was spent or even <em>if</em> it was spent&quot; and &quot;We lost 2.3 trillion dollars&quot; are really two ways of saying the same thing?  In both cases, 2.3 trillion dollars did exist, and now it&#39;s gone, and no one knows where any of it went.</p>

<p>How can you possibly say that it wasn&#39;t lost or stolen?  Literally the least you can say is that it was lost.  Or wait, let&#39;s call it &quot;misplaced&quot; since newspeak sounds better...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Pentagon is, much like large corporations and other long standing bureaucracies, replete with waste and redundancies. It is the headquarters for 4 branches of the military, each of which have their own equipment, personnel, logistics, and special projects. Try to imagine how difficult it would be to audit the Pentagon if each project had its own bookkeeping formats and standards, if there are dozens of separate accounting software systems, some a decade or more old, none of which are able to communicate with each other. </p>

<p>If you wanted to investigate one project, you could do so, and the information would be available, if inconveniently arranged. If you wanted to investigate the entirety, the tangled mass would require more time and effort than each of the parts taken individually. </p>

<p>Or are you saying that the Pentagon never has any idea how it&#39;s spending it&#39;s money and that there are probably trillions more in their budgets that are also unaccounted for?</p>

<p>You also avoided my simple question of how &quot;missing&quot; is different from &quot;misplaced or stolen&quot;.  Unless the money vanished into the ether, there are only so many ways it could&#39;ve gone missing.</p>

<p>Normal? Not amongst most corporations or government agencies, no. For the Pentagon, yes. It&#39;s an incredibly wasteful organization with a corrupt relationship with its suppliers. Acceptable? Certainly not. </p>

<p>However there is a difference between arguing that the Pentagon is incompetent at tracking their expenditures and engages in an incestuous relationship with the manufacturing branch of the MIC, and suggesting that a lump sum of 2.3 trillion was missing &amp; they hijacked a plane/used a drone/fired a missile from a helicopter in order to assassinate the accountants investigating the loss.</p>

<p>&quot;Missing&quot;, &quot;misplaced&quot;, or &quot;stolen&quot; all refer to the money itself, and are spins put on the situation by the media and conspiracists with an agenda. The money was spent, it wasn&#39;t missing. The issue was that they couldn&#39;t tell how all of it was spent without an intense investigation, which is what they were doing, and continued to do after the attacks</p>

<p>Imagine trying to get someone&#39;s finances in order. They have receipts everywhere, some in folders, some in boxes, some stuffed inside of books. At times they tried different accounting systems, even digitizing some of the invoices, but some of the computers are ancient and no longer used. They spent the money, you just can&#39;t figure out what they spent all of it on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the U.S like every other country on the planet is made up of gangs , just because they don&#39;t wear a red handkerchief in their back pocket does not mean they aren&#39;t there in plain sight .. </p>

<p>for years people have been giving information on who they are , what they own , what they control , their agenda ..  </p>

<p>freemasons , Illuminati, Rosicrucians, Jesuits, mafia , you name it , they are real and they all have power , the &quot;united&quot; states are not as united as one might think , they are after all individual states with self governing bodies , the government of the united states over sees all those smaller governments ..</p>

<p>the biggest land owners are all connected to organisations like freemasons , Illuminati, Rosicrucians, Jesuits, mafia.. and even the church of Rome , Morons 9yes every church) can be seen as a gang  (please do not ignore what i am going to say next) it only takes one man who has had a family member fall ill and an organisation to come to their rescue when the &quot;government&quot; fails them .. this man may have a grudge against the government or business .. business man or men ... there is people like this all over the world , in gangs or not part of any thing at all ..  </p>

<p>there are powerful people in the world , some victims of wars in other countries , some with a grudge , they go to the u.s in search of a better life , they fall in with the wrong people , they learn the truth .<br/>
the truth - within the government of the united states are gangs ..   </p>

<p>9/11 was not an inside job , it was a job ..carried out by a gang who holds more power than the government of the united states . if they cant bring the people who did it to justice .. it is because their gang is not as big or powerful then the gang who did it ..  </p>

<p>remember that..</p>

<p>And nothing is solid enough to leave a round circular hole  in a wall and  then instantly disappear, except a missile.</p>

<p>Edit for  the promised stalkers.  It&#39;s actually good that you are here. Thanks. This is the inside of the Pentagon on 9/11 </p>

<p>Something made an approximately 6 ft. circular hole as it came through the left was and  it didn&#39;t leave any mark to indicate it ever hit the right wall at all. so it was massive as it entered this alleyway and  apparently did not have the mass to mark the right wall by the time it got there.The commenter I&#39;m replying to demanded a time stamp to prove when the photo was taken. The time stamp is the smoke in the air and that indication is  bolstered by the fire hoses.</p>

<p>My question for this skeptical commenter   was &#39;which one is capable of disappearing instantly, an airliner or a missile?&#39;.  see the full post here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The question I have honestly is has anyone questioned or have evidence/links as to why a plane that can seat 250+ people had only 60 something people onboard? I ask this only because I have flown on over 500 flights in the last 5 years alone and I have had maybe 3 flights, literally, that have not been close to capacity and my flights were to the midwest of all places, not very high demand. I am not a big conspiracy theorist other than its fun to question and a lot of the evidence and reasoning is somewhat plausible, but this to me is a very strange thing. Now maybe this was more common before 9/11 and the tight margins airlines are experiencing currently, so I do consider that because airlines really have changed the way they book flight capacity and available flights but, all things the same this is something that would raise a flag to me before a military style designated target scenario as is proposed here. Given the flight destination (LA) this to me would be a very unprofitable flight, something airlines do not do, again this is pre 9/11 so it&#39;s plausible that this was more the norm before, but this, financially and logistically speaking, is not something airlines do, nor would I think a flight from DC to LA have that low of demand in the first place that it would not fill up that flight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t answer for those particular flights or the state of airlines pre-911, but Airlines routinely fly partially or empty planes from one location to another. Even if that particular flight is unprofitable, they still need the aircraft at the new location for the next flight.</p>

There is a massive amount of plane debris at the Pentagon which BS movies like Loose Change and In Plane Sight don&#39;t show you.

<p>My own opinion is that the parts (which were never verified as  coming from the correct plane) were simply hand carried out of the hole in the wall. Carrying them out by hand would look completely normal and appear to be making space for rescues. That&#39;s why every piece of  engine or landing gear or the wheel rim that they produced pictures of to bolster their story, you know, the heavier pieces, were barely transported out of the building.</p>

<p>There was one piece of reasonably large aluminum on the lawn, easily hand carried and placed there.</p>

<p>You will note that the lawn was covered three feet deep immediately after the event baring the accidental uncovering of forensic evidence.</p>

<p>You apparently have never talked to anyone who has any flight experience and have just made this all up in your head.</p>

<p>The lawn marking you are citing wasn&#39;t there as a trajectory... it&#39; a path that people take to go to the site.... after 9/11. Do a google search of your own photo and check your date, dear.</p>

<p>Nothing is going to hover near ground level OR be able to deliver that kind of firepower from a helicopter. Do you have a basic understanding of physics?</p>

<p>Actually... do you have an understanding of what the Sailors in that wing did? Do you actually think they were looking into a missing 2.3 Trillion? Dude. This isn&#39;t NCIS... that&#39;s not their job. A missing 2.3 Trillion  was above their paygrade.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not a discussion when a person is blatantly and verifiably wrong, and clearly speaking far, far outside their area of knowledge. His articulation of his point made him look like a fool. That post is me correcting him and excusing him from continuing a conversation that he has no place being in.</p>

<p>Simply put, I went into the conversation knowing that no one would be able to state a missile system capable of the type of damage seen at the Pentagon that could be fired from a helicopter. Anyone answering was bound to be wrong for one reason or another. This guy claiming that an air-to-air missile with only ~130lbs of explosives was going to create the gaping hole in a concrete reinforced structure was just the cherry on top.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m actually trying to bring rational thought into this instead of some kind of &quot;maybe it was a helicopter with a missile&quot; nonsense to this discussion.</p>

<p>Do this <em>bro</em> figure out what kind of payload that helicopter would have to be carrying and how low it would have to be for only one old lady to see it... then test that theory with basic math. See what happens to the chopper. Then you may return to the discussion</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok I&#39;m not sure about the helicopter part either. It could have been a helicopter flying away from the helipad situated right there before the attack. And something you said about the navy version of the FBI office seems accurate also - the pentagon is pretty damned secure by any standard. When people say why is there no footage of the attack on the pentagon? Its common knowledge that no one in Washington would want that footage out there. Here is the control center of the biggest military in the world and a passenger jet just flies into it. That&#39;s like mike Tyson getting knocked out by an old lady. It&#39;s an embarrassment. The problem I have is that I just don&#39;t see a hollow passenger jet punching the hole shown. The wings would shear off at the initial impact and be left outside. My question to you is, in your opinion sir, what would punch a hole like that in the pentagon?</p>

<p>Stop trying to rethink what happened. Some nut jobs (who may or may not be planted for another reason) crashed some planes into some buildings. REAL PEOPLE DIED. THIS WAS NOT A VIDEO GAME. THESE PEOPLE DID NOT RESPAWN ELSEWHERE to live happy lives. The people in that office in the pentagon are DEAD.</p>

<p>It was a plane. The plane came in and no one could stop it. There are patriot missle launchers all around DC as a result. NO ONE thought it could happen but it DID.</p>

<p>STOP turning this into a &quot;maybe it was a helicopter&quot; bullshit. It wasn&#39;t. It was a plane... of screaming horrified people. DEAL WITH IT</p>

<p>Now you can look at why it happened and then look at the motives of who and why. Stop this BS about &quot;maybe it was time travel&quot; shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a hollow pressurized tube of aluminum sir. I never said it was a time traveling, helicopter, video game. Airplanes are built to be strong enough to resist tearing themselves apart while being light enough to fly - NOT to punch through six walls of fucking concrete. There were missile launchers on top of the pentagon before 911 and Air Force bases minutes from the site that have any number of aircraft with the ability to be in the air in seconds that SHOULD have stopped whatever hit the pentagon. Whatever hit the building was allowed to hit the building, I thought from your replies you were in the position to realize this. Either you choose to be ignorant of what happened or you can&#39;t bring yourself to admit that no fucking way a passenger jet does that kind of damage. A missile launched from a helicopter would have a better chance of breaching every layer of concrete. If your answer is that a passenger jet did that much damage and left behind no evidence then I will cease to engage you further. </p>

<p>Ha Ha Ha Ha.... they tried. The missions failed.</p>

<p>The pentagon attack was below radar range and the focus was on the one they had &quot;eyes&quot; on.</p>

<p>You need to inform yourself and not just take what is spoon fed to you to be someone worth conversing with. &quot;I think 911 was a helipcopter scam&quot; isn&#39;t enough.</p>

<p>And YES... there is every fucking way a passenger jet did that kind of damage. It&#39;s called math and physics. LEARN IT.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are two sets of witnesses. The ones who saw the airliner fly south of the naval annex and fly towards the Pentagon but did not see the impact and that Flight path would not account for the downed light poles and those that say it flew Noth of the Naval Annex and struck the building as the official story states. Guess which group of witnesses are made up primarily of government employees. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many different groups made separate billions  and or millions of dollars and the New York Port Authority saved billions they didn&#39;t have to spend on demolishing the trade center.</p>

<p>The trade center had it&#39;s face about to fall off because the aluminum fascia was connected directly to the dis-similar steel frame which caused decades of galvanic corrosion. There was also 40 floors of asbestos in each of the two towers and in building 7.</p>

<p>It would have taken years of political wrangling just to get a permit and then you could spend more than the property was worth to do a legal demolition so the building had an accident and then there would be the inevitable mountain of law suits.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the asbestos in question.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/egn70NF">http://imgur.com/egn70NF</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s a tale of the galvanic corrosion by a long term email acquaintance who was so afraid of the consequences he eventually fled the country. </p>

<p>Tom Scott Gordon&#39;s deposition Galvanic Corrosion.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lege.net/content/tsg.deposition.1.html">http://blog.lege.net/content/tsg.deposition.1.html</a></p>

<p>Galvanic corrosion</p>

<blockquote>
<p>WTC already doomed.</p>

<p>That grandiose Titanic called the World Trade Center, which had been planned to last for at least a century, soon revealed itself to be an engineering stupidity and technological embarrassment. The facade, made of cast aluminum, had been directly connected to the steel superstructure. This caused a battery-like electric flow between the two metals resulting in what&#39;s known as galvanic corrosion. This problem had been text-book predictable in the marine-air environment of lower Manhattan, hence the embarrassment.</p>

Except in her video,  she says that a small business class jet flew across the Pentagon lawn and exploded over the helipad without hitting the building. </p>
