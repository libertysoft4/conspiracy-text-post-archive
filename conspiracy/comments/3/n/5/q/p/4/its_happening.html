We can expect one of two things; A) continual proxy maneuvers and cowardice displayed by the West, followed by an EMP attack and ritual sacrifice of the American people in order to bring about global governance, or B) direct military confrontation between the two sides and the eventual World War III.

The dollar is in a Chinese noose, just waiting for treasury bonds to be sold on the open market (which has already been happening). Markets all over the world are collapsing, and it won&#39;t take much to set off a fire in the US. If the dollar dips it runs the risk of losing reserve status, and the Chinese know this.

    <div class="md"><p>Markets all over the world are collapsing, and it won&#39;t take much to set off a fire in the US. </p>

<p>-just take a look at pretty much any market in recent history, the DJI has dropped 3,000 in a period of 3 months. We are currently experiencing a &quot;dead cat bounce&quot;, or rebound after the initial shock of a drop (which occurred a month ago).</p>

<p>If the dollar dips it runs the risk of losing reserve status, and the Chinese know this. If it loses reserve status, the US basically becomes a 3rd world country in 5 years.</p>

<p>-due to Bretton Woods, oil is traded with $, which has provided tremendous stability for the $ since the 40&#39;s. The Fed knows this and has adopted a policy of runaway printing, largely due to this agreement. The US $ is also used for the vast amount of large transactions worldwide. There is a tipping point in which businesses, governments, and banking institutions decide that the $ isn&#39;t strong or stable enough to facilitate transactions. When this moment comes, the $ is in deep shit, and it will lose tremendous amounts of value. The primary reason that China has the capacity to break the US&#39;s neck with the click of a mouse is because they&#39;re the largest holder of treasury bonds, and if they dump all of them on the market at once, the dollar is almost instantly worthless and chaos ensues for Americans. Imagine you&#39;re trying to sell your house, and half of the houses on your block are all owned by the same guy who you&#39;re at war with. If you&#39;re trying to get 100k and he dumps all the houses on the market simultaneously for 75k a piece, what&#39;s the likelihood of your house selling? The US is in more debt than any country on earth by a long shot, and the reason we go to war is to maintain the value of the $, plain and simple.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except what they are saying is incredibly alarmist. China recently dumped a large amount of treasuries to prop up their currency and it didn&#39;t make a dent in the dollar. Now this is not to say that China dumping everything wouldn&#39;t hurt the dollar but it would by no means make it worthless. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The primary reason that China has the capacity to break the US&#39;s neck with the click of a mouse is because they&#39;re the largest holder of treasury bonds</p>
</blockquote>

<p>China holds 8% of American debt. 8%. Also China&#39;s economy would tank if they sold off all their American debt. They need it more than the US needs them too. China&#39;s economy would also tank if the US economy did. China relies on exports far far more than the US. If the world economy went to shit the US would be in a much better position to weather the storm. As far as reserve currency status goes, who would the world turn to? Certainly not China. Their economy is not doing so great and, just as important, no one trusts the numbers they publish.</p>

<p>Anyway, don&#39;t believe me or the other poster. Read up on this from a variety of sources. And always remember, economics is a prime field for people to push their narratives. Be it political or trying to sell you something, an economic narrative about imminent destruction or golden times just round the corner should always make you wary. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>China is considered a growth nation (along with Brazil, Russia, India) meaning most portfolios have shares in said countries for high interest value. When China came out and had to do some currency protections by selling off US treasuries to relive market currency stress. countries that were leveraged to far in growth had to take a loss and it triggered a domino effect. (much like US did with bad mortgage bundles in 2008. the slippery slope people will always cry China holds our future and the sky is falling but the reality is that they only own 7% of our debt. Japan is the #2 holder of our treasuries along with a lot of europe rounding out the top 10. The US dollar in global trade is not easily replaced bc of the sheer mass of it and its reliability. if China did flood the market with its treasuries (and it would never do something that economically suicidal) our Allies and the US private side would simply buy them out bc they have always had good return. currencies reflect the nation&#39;s GDP not the other way around.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly.  The dollar is probably the strongest currency in the world at the moment. The Chinese market is in shambles and there is no other currency available besides the dollar that the world could adopt as the reserve currency.  Maybe the world could adopt a basket of currencies but the dollar would absolutely be included in it and would probably still remain the strongest.  The fear mongering in this sub is out of control.  So many here take people peddling gold online at their word when in reality they are just snake oil salesmen. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>“Based on this new information, we now estimate that Treasury is likely to exhaust its extraordinary measures on or about Thursday, November 5,” Lew wrote in a letter to Boehner. “At that point, we could be left to fund the government with only the cash we have on hand, which we currently forecast to be below $30 billion. This amount would be far short of net expenditures on certain days, which can be as high as $60 billion.”</p>

<p>Lew said the date could still fluctuate somewhat from Nov. 5, but the letter makes clear that the situation is more urgent than anticipated by lawmakers and staffers who expected to be able to bundle a debt limit increase with an early-December spending package.</p>

<p>“Without sufficient cash, it would be impossible for the United States of America to meet all of its obligations for the first time in our history,” Lew wrote.</p>

Afaic, Russia and the rest of the East have long been controlled opposition. Russia, China, etc, have long had embedded Rothschild agents, but they&#39;ve gone to great lengths to hide it, as it is one of the greatest clues of all. You may be asking: if these nations are already controlled, why don&#39;t they simply align them all under one banner of global governance?</p>

<p>Because the people of these nations won&#39;t except it. They won&#39;t except it until they are brought to their knees. They won&#39;t except until all of their rights are stripped from them. Until all of their digital networks, and digital content are wiped out. Until the dissidents are all gone. Until all of our wise old sages are disappeared. If you ask me, they are attempting to hit the reset button because they see that at the rate this world is going, they only have so much time left until the world turns against them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Putin isn&#39;t playing chess. He&#39;s playing Othello.</p>

<p>First, some background. For Iran to get the bomb doesn&#39;t mean Tel Aviv gets nuked. It means Tehran doesn&#39;t get nuked. And Tehran stays protected even if Iran launches its long-desired conventional war against Israel. In short, Iran getting the bomb means Israel gets invaded.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why Israel&#39;s neighbors had to get fresh puppets (Arab Spring et al). Syria was in the process of getting a fresh puppet (through the ISIS proxy).</p>

<p>Now that&#39;s out the window. Now Israel is cornered. After Putin grabs Syria, Israel just might do the Camp David with Russia. And after Israel, then Egypt. Three countries in a nice Othello row. And after Egypt, then Saudi Arabia. And after Saudi Arabia, then the U.S. economy tanks.</p>

<p>Russia may reestablish its alliances with the countries that haven&#39;t joined NATO yet: Ukraine, the -stans, and India. Russia won&#39;t take over China, but it might economically ally with China and embargo rare earth metals. It might help China take over Taiwan. Russia won&#39;t touch NATO, but it&#39;ll take everything else.</p>

<p>Without oil, without rare earth metals, without Foxconn, without U.S.-trained Indian software engineers, what has the U.S. got left? A drastically reduced standard of living, that&#39;s what. Which sets up a breakup of the U.S.</p>

<p>Texas will be the first to secede, as it&#39;s in their constitution. Then California, which might take as much as everything west of the Mississippi along with it.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s the best-case scenario. Worst case is U.S. sends massive troops to the Golan Heights, and the area becomes a nuclear powderkeg. Unlike with Germany and the Iron Curtain, the U.S. does not control Israel&#39;s nukes. While cooler heads in Israel wouldn&#39;t want to risk a nuclear exchange, elements in Israel are quick (too quick) to rush to Israel&#39;s &quot;defense&quot;. Russia/Iran retaliate, with massive U.S. &quot;collateral damage&quot;, meaning the U.S. has been attacked. Worldwide nuclear exchange.</p>

<p>Russia has just today conscripted 150,000 soldiers. Putin isn&#39;t bluffing.</p>

<p>What&#39;s that about the 7-year cycle? Maybe it&#39;s real, or maybe it&#39;s just a self-fulfilling prophecy. Either way, it&#39;s happening now.</p>

<p>But really, isn&#39;t CNN known to be a warmongering, scripted &quot;news&quot; network? Or do you think it&#39;s a valid source? Maybe I&#39;m being presumptuous..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My take on this... The major News outlets, they all push an agenda of division. They are strategically setup to play news that is contradictory. Although not entirely unreliable. They are not outright making stuff up. They are just spinning and working it. As an example, about a year ago... Isis was in Iraq attacking whatever targets they were actually attacking. One side of the news coin (fox/cnn) painted the picture that Isis was gearing up for an all out assault on American troops. The other side (ABC/msnbc) downplayed it, minimizing what Isis was doing. The reality was, Isis was in Iraq. They were 3 miles outside of an American post. The threat level was upped and troops were put on stand by. The reality was somewhere in the middle. That&#39;s why I subscribe to all major news sources and avoid stuff that seems sensationalized. If you look for trigger words and just replace them with common simpleton speak its much closer to the truth. Kind of how we use awesome without actually using it correctly. That&#39;s what news stations do now. I&#39;m not quite sure that will make sense to you. Its a little disjointed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think your example makes sense, thanks. But I think their agendas make them inclined to predictably support or oppose certain matters with consistency... CNN &amp; war being one example. It sounds like you&#39;re watching with a critical mind but in my honest opinion, not watching CNN/FOX/ABC news at all would be even more beneficial. They are too powerful of propaganda machines for us to completely see through them, no matter how aware.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I take everything with a grain of salt. Theres two contradictory ideas that I see popping up on reddit. Increasingly commonly, one is the trend to put down major news outlets, then when given an outside news outlet to put it down for not having the same far reaching fingers. Essentially people blatantly unwilling to believe anything from anyone at any given time, except for there own personal one website that perfectly panders to what they wish to hear. The truth often not being what anybody wants to hear. The other trend I see more and more of is the outright cries for violent revolution, immediately followed by an addendum being, I am no leader! Somebody else go first! I want to live to see the other side of the revolution! I&#39;m not suggesting they&#39;re correlated. They both just piss me off. It really shows me how much TPTB have won. We will openly contradict ourselves in an effort to seem cutting edge without actually having to step onto that ledge. Anywho were boned all the way around Imo. We&#39;ve been given the perfect amount of prepackaged choice to keep us simultaneous content but not prosperous. Everything is cookie cutter. Everything is owned by a global elite. The one world order is already a thing. It just wasn&#39;t the violent takeover that people were expecting. It was quite literally a war for the mind and we the general populace lost. Sorry &#39;bout the rambling diatribe. Stress and stuff. </p>

<p>That was very well put. It annoys me immensely too. I don&#39;t post sources in discussions on reddit. Anyone replying to me can find sources that support my point and others that seem to negate it, so what&#39;s the point?</p>

Not to mention it&#39;s all over the Internet and the deep web. This shit is real. You guys can keep waving your dicks in the wind all you want I&#39;m jut teying to vent, and keep painting the target on my back so when they ineveibaly SILENCE US my people will know why.

<p>Might be a good idea to chill out on the venting. Do some research. Compile some proof. Without a source there are no facts, ______.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I apologize, I&#39;m upset. However, I didn&#39;t even watch it on CNN, I&#39;ve simply been following this situation for too long and have too much invested in it to be scrutinized for &quot;sources&quot;. Here&#39;s a fact, everything I learn of value these days comes from the Internet, whereas we used to be able to trust TV, newspaper, books, magazines, etc. I&#39;m assuming the Internet is somewhat free, but really who knows. If your going to criticize one source, one side, one idea; then their all suspect. The point I&#39;m making is, clearly something big is happening and its making me feel energized and alert. I&#39;m not trying to spread fear or anything; I mentioned this in my government class today and the teacher and everyone in the class gave me deer in headlights looks. None of them even knew the air strikes happened! The government doesn&#39;t have to hide what&#39;s happening because no one even fucking cares! I&#39;m sorry for projecting this onto you, but this is how I feel about the situation. </p>

Maybe next time I won&#39;t just say &quot;source?&quot; because it kind of seems like I&#39;m trying to call out bullshit, when in reality it&#39;s meant as more of a &quot;holy shit, I wonder where you read that?&quot;. Anyway sorry for being a dick back.</p>

<p>I also agree that the situation in Syria could get more fucked up.. Unfortunately I kind of expect the US to make some crazy move, because right now I think they either have to connive some more bullshit or applaud Russia&#39;s actions. And I think they&#39;ll destroy the world before they praise anything related to Putin. Stay vigilant my friend</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right? </p>

<p>It&#39;s so sad to think that they were all (according to Pike,  anyways)  used to gain some sort of social control. </p>

<p>The first world war was to remove the kings/czars of Russia  instate communism and use it to weaken surrounding empires ( see also Soviet unions emergence,  Japan, China, Korea, etc) as well as religious ideology in the area. </p>

<p>The second world war was to make the Jews look like the good guys essentially (paraphrased from Pike&#39;s words), to use Zionism to quash Nazism in a triumph. Also to make Israel a state. That was essentially the gist of the war. To give the Jews back their land. </p>

<p>The third world war is going to be all the religions against each other, the governments are supposed to come to our rescue once we have experienced a social cataclysm. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.threeworldwars.com/albert-pike2.htm">http://www.threeworldwars.com/albert-pike2.htm</a> took that info from here. Which took it from a letter that was hung in a UK museum for a while. It has since &#39;disappeared&#39;.  </p>

<p>I&#39;d be inclined to listen to this guy, as he had a tie to Otto von Bismarck and a direct role in bringing about WWI. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. Read the link I posted, its all in there. </p>

<p>What kills me, is that Pike divulged these plans in the 1800&#39;s. When Nazism and communism weren&#39;t words. </p>

<p>How did he know about them <em>before</em> they reared their heads?  It&#39;d all bullshit. That&#39;s how.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;re already in a Cyber World War. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s really much question to that one with the way surveillance, technology, and hacking are in the world right now. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll ever get into another global conventionally armed world conflict. We&#39;ll have brushfire proxy wars but nuclear weapons are too big a threat for any major powers to ever go head to head out in the open.</p>

<p>There&#39;s really only one flashpoint that could be volatile enough to warrant war instead of diplomacy - two deeply held belief systems exterminating each other. It might be militant Islam vs the world ala ISIS, the liberal vs conservative culture war that Fox keeps trying to stir up, or some economic crap like communism vs liberalism again. It&#39;ll only come to blows if there&#39;s literally no room for reason.</p>

<p>Make no mistake...this will be another brushfire war and then it&#39;ll die down after all the sides figure out the economic benefit of &quot;winning&quot; doesn&#39;t justify the cost of fighting and the human suffering Assad is causing as a pricktator is less than what we&#39;d see in a prolonged war. It was the same stakes with the oil and blood in Iraq. And it&#39;ll be the same with ISIS. They&#39;ll piss the rest of the world off with their zealous beheadings and economic isolationism, and we&#39;ll all band together to knock their teeth out before going our separate ways once the loot and oil is flowing again.</p>

<p>it&#39;s too easy to project frustrations sourced elsewhere into <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, which really is a great place. And I&#39;m totally admitting that I do. The majority of the people are just here to learn. But I guess so many topics here also affect so many deep-rooted beliefs that it makes it more tense</p>
