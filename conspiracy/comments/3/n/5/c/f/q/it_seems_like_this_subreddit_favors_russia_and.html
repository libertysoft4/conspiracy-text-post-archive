    <div class="md"><p>First off, this is important: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem">Ad hominem</a></p>

<p>I don&#39;t think many people here would actually defend Putin, the lifelong KGB agent, as a real &quot;hero&quot; of the people.</p>

<p>But what is heroic about him is his current opposition of the Western war machine. He&#39;s actually doing something about one of the matters that this entire sub <em>revolves</em> around.</p>

<p>At least myself, when I mention Putin in good light it is not venerating him personally but praising his stance or action. i.e. Most people aren&#39;t saying &quot;Putin is a saint&quot; but instead &quot;Check out some true things that Putin said&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Russia is doing something for the better of the world, and I&#39;m on board with that.</p>

<p>What they do in Russia is all on them, and I&#39;m not on board with any of that.</p>

<p>What I do know is that ISIS is stirring up shit, and the USA is not doing anything but aiding them, and giving them publicity.</p>

<p>They have been saying for almost a year that they are going to do something about it, and Russia finally steps up to address the problem at the UN, and quickly takes action against ISIS. I was surprised when I checked reddit today, to find that Russia has been bombing ISIS territory day and night.</p>

<p>I am on board with that. Controlled opposition or not, I really hope this stirs the shitpot for Obama admin. </p>

<p>Given my unbiased response, I feel there are a lot of Putin band wagoners, who are settling in the satisfaction they get from him taking action, who are strongly biased against Obama admin, and see past how he runs his own country.</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t mean they are supporting Putin in ways of banning gays, or offing his opponents in elections. In fact, I don&#39;t see what either of those Russian matters have to do with bombing ISIS at all. If you have a problem with things like that, maybe you should take it up with your own country who has been shrouded in political mystery for ages. I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re here acting like everyone is defecting to Russia or something.</p>

<p>First off, if you&#39;re going to talk about another country, at least know what you are talking about. Being gay is not illegal in Russia. You will not go to jail for it. There is however a law about homosexuality and Pedophilia propaganda towards children. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8xSZ9Fr4c0">Listen with your own ears to Putin himself talking about it.</a> We in the West are so brainwashed with pro  Western propaganda.

<p>Got a source/example for that? The law says propaganda towards <strong>children</strong> not <strong>adults</strong>. </p>

<p>But the way Putin is venerated here; well, frankly it&#39;s suspicious. He is in control of a massive empire which is largely ruled by a mafia criminal class.</p>

<p>Hold your thoughts there cowboy, you could equally be describing Obama or Cameron. The truth be told they all work for banking/energy interests. </p>

<p>Putin is not revered here but sometimes it&#39;s healthy to listen to supposed enemy voices. The conspiracy page has no allegiance to anyone but Putin makes for interesting geopolitical drama. </p>

<p>Besides, and given the last 15-20 years of US interfering and meddling in the middle east, who can really look at Vlad and say he is the real enemy?</p>

<p>Sometimes the biggest threat is the <a href="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/81qTgunrUOL.jpg">enemy within</a></p>

<p>Well I&#39;m in the UK and in all honesty and seriousness you would do really well to find anyone who sees Cameron as a hero. I can&#39;t really speak for America but our current leader is pretty much a hated figure wherever you go. </p>

<p>All other world leaders?! That&#39;s not really true is it. Haven&#39;t Obama, Blair, Bush done many &#39;questionable things?&#39; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The US government will not listen to its people or the UN. It took Putin and Russia to finally throw the bullshit of training &quot;moderate rebels&quot; into the National limelight. </p>

<p>Being an American this instance has been a conversation starter with family and friends to show the truth of the war on terror. Putin 60 minutes speech and UN address is enough to get people thinking for themselves about what we are doing in the middle east. </p>

<p>Yet we must stay active for propaganda from both sides, yet I&#39;d rather support stabilizing Syria then looking for a way to remove Assad, preferably not through a war or coup, but dialogue with the people of Syria. Iraq and Libya proved that ousting a leader does not mean stability will come to these middle eastern nations. </p>

<p>First off, if you&#39;re going to talk about another country, at least know what you are talking about. Being gay is not illegal in Russia. You will not go to jail for it. There is however a law about homosexuality and Pedophilia propaganda towards children. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8xSZ9Fr4c0">Listen with your own ears to Putin himself talking about it.</a> We in the West are so brainwashed with pro  Western propaganda. It&#39;s bloody ignorant.</p>
