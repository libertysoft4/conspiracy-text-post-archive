        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The actions of the US government have become so deliberately self-defeating, it leaves me to wonder... will we be painted as the next monsters of history?</p>

<p>The recent bombing of the hospital, the actions of Putin and Russia bombing ISIS and the US response... the US has spent 40 years being &quot;the bad guy&quot; of our own doing, by invading and overthrowing other countries, but now it seems to be accelerating to a farcical level. Maybe it&#39;s just the media I consume, maybe lots of people see it happening too, I don&#39;t know. </p>

<p>The Govt is backing Israel, funding and supporting Saudi Arabia... giving them billions a year in free money, which they&#39;re mostly required to spend buying US arms and military equipment. It supports our economy, which is about 1/5 military-industrial complex. But now we&#39;re just flat-out giving guns to Al Qaeda, ISIS, etc, to destabilize Russian-friendly governments, so that the US govt can take them over and install US-friendly govts. And Russia is doing the same thing.</p>

<p>Proxy wars are where the rebels are one side and the local national government is the other side, and the US funds and arms one of them, and Russia funds and arms the other. Ukraine, Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran have all been in this situation for decades. </p>

<p>But then you learn the most odd thing, after learning all this. You learn that the bankers who the US government is beholden to, the reason it has $17 trillion dollars of debt instead of just creating its own money for free, those very groups of people also run the russian banks. They own both sides. There&#39;s no real Russia vs US conflict any more than there is a Pepsi vs Coke conflict. It&#39;s a matter of branding and PR. One rich family&#39;s feud against another, at best.  </p>

<p>Why do they create war? </p>

<ol>
<li><p>War is profitable and harnesses lots of human effort to create a more efficient profit machine. They corral existing sentiments of nationalism/patriotism and harness it to create great technology and systems of social organization. War is a discovery machine, at the expense of millions of humans&#39; lives. And the owners of nations get first dibs on the new tech.</p></li>
<li><p>The divide and conquer strategy pits two equally-powerful social hierarchies against each other (Russia vs US) which focuses the power they contain against each other, instead against the powerful wealthy few people controlling both of them. Because without a doubt, if the energy of hundreds of millions of people were focused toward removing exactly only those at the very top of the hierarchy, it would be accomplished very quickly. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Thus, the most important defense of a hundred-billionaire is something called &quot;plausible deniability&quot;. The more layers, the better. They have to have reasons why they didn&#39;t do it, why the guys <em>below</em> them did it. That&#39;s why they never get caught, because there&#39;s a million layers of shit protecting them: intelligence, PR, connections, security, money, lawyers, yes-men, family history, and a good bullshit story. Plausible deniability. This keeps them safe and powerful, despite the accusations of many. The corruption of our justice system in recent decades especially allows for this.</p>

<p>Governments are merely interfaces between the powerful and the citizens, scar tissue from their interaction, which is why they are so slow to get anything done and have so much bureaucracy. It is scar-tissue to safeguard, slow down, and mitigate interactions between one side and the other.  </p>

<p>So to have a global narrative going forward, they <em>have</em> to have a good guy and a bad guy. This is how everyone will talk about it, after it happens, just like WW2. The US looks like a bad guy from actions all over the world over the last 50+ years, but if we paint it with a more intense brush, then we can make it look like they&#39;re just pure satan incarnate, then the world won&#39;t feel bad dogpiling on them in a world war situation.  I feel like that narrative is slowly being painted before our eyes, &quot;the US is bad like you already thought, but it&#39;s even worse and they&#39;re corrupt to the bone, they deserve this&quot;. </p>

<p>If there were a war, then this narrative keeps the elite safe in their positions of power. This is a thick layer of plausible deniability. &quot;The <em>US govt</em> are the bad guys, not the international central bankers!&quot; </p>

<p>During a war, everyone is intensely distracted by nationalism, promoted by the media. Then this becomes the new history and the world rolls on, thinking it has defeated a true evil nation in the world, while in reality giving even more power for those powerful few at the top, who own both sides. </p>

<p>This is the level our national dialogue needs to be at. Not at the level of MSM. Let&#39;s wake up and get real about this stuff. Talk to people you know about these details. When shit hits the fan there will be a lot of anger, and it&#39;s important to make sure that anger is not directed inappropriately to scapegoats of racism, sexism, religions, or even nationalism! </p>

<p>Thousands hack at the branches, but can you cut at the root?</p>

When Hitler came along and decided the Germans had enough, they took back their lands and rights, reunified their people, and they were punished for it again when the Allies declared war on them, thus stripping their nation again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They deported refugees from Russia into camps outside of Germany. The same as the Americans did with the Japanese. Those camps were inspected by the IRC and were deemed as concentration camps, not death camps. The reason many died at Treblinka and a couple others was due to lack of supplies during the end of the war when Germany was rubble. Those people were not thought of at all by the Allies when they were bombing railways, roads, pharmaceuticals and food supplies.</p>

<p>The majority of those camp deaths were from typhus. Up until 1943, those camps were like towns with incoming and outgoing mail and communities with activities. They were places for criminals, POWs and refugees.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>August 27, 1943 10 p.m. At the suggestion of the British government, there is insufficient evidence to justify the statement regarding execution in gas chambers, it has been agreed to eliminate the last phrase in paragraph 2 of the &quot;Declaration of German crimes in Poland&quot; beginning &quot;where&quot; and ending &quot;chambers&quot; thus making the second paragraph end with &quot;concentration camps&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s been well documented that they faked the &quot;towns&quot; for the IRC,
&quot;Late in the war, after D-Day and the Invasion of Normandy, the Nazis permitted representatives from the Danish Red Cross and the International Red Cross to visit Theresienstadt in order to dispel rumors about the extermination camps. The commission that visited on June 23, 1944, included E. Juel-Henningsen, the head physician at the Danish Ministry of Health, and Franz Hvass, the top civil servant at the Danish Foreign Ministry. Dr. Paul Eppstein was instructed by the SS to appear in the role of the mayor of Theresienstadt.[29]</p>

<p>Weeks of preparation preceded the visit. The area was cleaned up, and the Nazis deported many Jews to Auschwitz to minimize the appearance of overcrowding in Theresienstadt. Also deported in these actions were most of the Czechoslovak workers assigned to &quot;Operation Embellishment&quot;. The Nazis directed the building of fake shops and cafés to imply that the Jews lived in relative comfort.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They were. The Czechoslovakian government was holding 3 million Germans hostage and they were being mistreated in the streets by both government and Czech. They were also using bribes to gain favour with Britain. Those 3 million voted unanimously for reunification. Britain and France even told Czechoslovakia to hand over the land that was given to them post-WW1 containing German people. They wanted a fight and lost.</p>

<p>Danzig and the German-Prussian region was German land with German people. When Poland decided to kill thousands of Germans after Hitler proposed to work with Poland to help the Germans by building a supply line to Danzig, and after they voted to reunify, Poland, with the backing of Britain told Hitler where to go even though they were facing the Soviets on the other side. So instead of working with Poland, Hitler worked with Stalin and divided the country. Poland played poker with the lives of their people and the Germans inside their border and lost hard.</p>

<p>All Hitler did was restore the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the German Empire that was ripped apart post-WW1 in an unfair Treaty of Versailles that subjugated Germans across Europe to other regimes. Austria also voted unanimously for reunification in one of the greatest acts of democracy after Hitler was able to dispose of their corrupt government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So where&#39;s the part where signing a treaty with Stalin and invading an annexing the sovereign nations of Poland, Austria, and Czechoslovakia are at all justified?</p>

<p>Oh wait - they weren&#39;t. Germany got war declared on it because they signed a peace treaty with a terrorist state and began invading and annexing their neighbors. In general that&#39;s considered to be rather illegal under international law.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Austria voted to be reunified. The 3 million Germans in Czechoslovakia that were annexed by the Czechs after WW1 voted to be reunified. Germans in Poland were being thrown out and murdered and the Polish government was using them as a way to gain ties with America and Britain and when America and Britain turned their backs on them to Stalin, they got what they asked for, an invasion.</p>

<p>Hitler offered Poland a road and a rail to Danzig to help the Germans there who were taken from Prussian lands. He was even willing to allow Poland to keep the economic value of the area as long as Germans were treated well and had access to the Fatherland. Poland spit in Hitler&#39;s face knowing he just reunified the other Germans in Europe and by force in Czech after Czechoslovakia refused to do what France and Britain told them to which was to return those stolen German Empire lands back to the Germans.</p>

<p>Stalin was one of the Allies. So how can Hitler be signing a treaty with a terrorist state if Uncle Joe was one of the good guys? Seems like a contradiction and major hypocrisy on the Allies&#39; and your part.</p>

<p>If annexing lands is illegal under international law, how come israel does it every decade? How come the Treaty of Versailles split up the German empire and gave its lands to other nations? Especially after a war that was 100% not Germany&#39;s fault.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Austria did NOT vote to be re-unified. A simple google search shows that although such a refferendum may have been the case in 1932, it would have been impossible in 1933 and later. Rather than being annexed, Hitler issued an ultimatum to the Austrian government essentially telling them to allow themselves to be annexed for face an invasion. That&#39;s not &quot;voting for re-unification&quot;, that&#39;s extortion. And while the German minority in Czechoslovakia may have been in favor of re-unification, that doesn&#39;t justify the annexation of <em>the entire country</em>. Not to mention that your comment that returning lands to the Germans was &quot;what France and Britain told them to do&quot; is completely false. France and Britain didn&#39;t tell the Czech government to do anything, they didn&#39;t even bother inviting the Czechs to the conference! Furthermore, your comment about Germans in Poland is not only false, it&#39;s completely the opposite of what actually happened. Using the Free City of Danzig as an example, the Polish military had to be brought in to restore order as German citizens of the city were openly attacking their Polish neighbors. Furthermore, remember that the roadway through the Corridor (which didn&#39;t include any economic connotations by the way) wasn&#39;t proposed to Poland until after the events in Czechoslovakia - it would be reasonable for the Polish government to distrust any proposal from the Germans at that point. Furthermore, you still have the problem of the occupation of the rest of the country, and more importantly, atrocities such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Tannenberg">Operation Tannenburg</a> being completely un-justified.</p>

<p>Now let&#39;s talk about the Soviet Union. Are you aware of something called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molotov%E2%80%93Ribbentrop_Pact">Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact</a>? It sounds like you aren&#39;t. The treaty was a treaty of non-aggression between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, with provisions included to divide up control of the Baltics region between the two nations. The Soviet Union did not become part of the Allies until after Germany invaded them as well - &quot;The enemy of my enemy is my friend&quot;, after all. But even then, the Soviet Union was largely ignored by the Western Allies - about all they got was lend-lease materials and vehicles that were either obsolete by the time they reached Soviet lines (Curtiss P-40 Warhawks, for example), or were never successful weapons to begin with (to use another aircraft, the Bell P-39 Airacobra). The Soviets were NEVER supporters of the strategy to attack Germany by going through Italy, and the Western Allies were really only interested in the Soviet Union as a way to keep half the German army elsewhere. The Western Allies would have been perfectly fine with the Germans running right into Moscow and killing every Soviet citizen they saw - the only reason the Soviets were even involved with the end-of-war conferences was because they happened to be very close to the gates of Berlin at the time, and the Soviets knew that. It was one of the many causes of the tensions that made up the Cold War.</p>

<p>Now, as for the Israel issue: First of all, you&#39;re exaggerating. Israel has annexed precisely three pieces of land: the Gaza Strip, from Egypt; the West Bank, from Jordan; and the Golan Heights, from... either Syria or Lebanon, I forget which. All of these gains were made I believe during the Six Day War. And it&#39;s because when they were first occupied they were not annexed territories but occupied territories that the status of those three territories is rather... problematic. The problem with those territories is that, well... no-one actually wants them, and in addition, they&#39;re not anyone&#39;s territory to give back at this point, as all nations (Israel included) recognize the Palestinian territories as, while not independent, as self-governing autonomous entities. The Israelis would very much like to not be economically responsible for the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, and the Golan Heights - the infrastructure there is falling apart, and literally everyone in those territories wants the Israelis driven into the sea. Hence why, with the recent exception of the West Bank, the Israelis have done... absolutely no development of the Golan and Gaza areas, and does not collect any profits from those areas. Not to mention that even if they wanted to annex those areas, they wouldn&#39;t due to the problems it would create - annexing those occupied territories would make the &quot;Jewish State&quot; a hell of a lot more Islamic, which most of the Israeli population does not want at all. So the Israelis don&#39;t want to annex their occupied territories, and holding onto them is technically illegal. So, you ask, why doesn&#39;t Israel just give the territories back to their original owners? Well... They don&#39;t want those lands back. It&#39;s not like they haven&#39;t had the opportunity to reclaim those territories through treaties; Egypt, for example, could very much have asked for the Gaza Strip back during the negotiation of the Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty and the Camp David Accords. And yet, they didn&#39;t. So that&#39;s Israel.</p>

<p>Now, let&#39;s talk about Versaillles. There&#39;s just no arguing that the Versailles treaty wasn&#39;t unfairly harsh, and most of that can be blamed on the French. I actually agree with you that the Versailles treaty should not have split up Germany, and if it hadn&#39;t than we likely never would have had the second Great War to begin with. That said, though, it&#39;s worth mentioning that it really wasn&#39;t until the Versailles treaty and the establishment of the League of Nations that &quot;International Law&quot; really became a thing. </p>

<p>And finally, let&#39;s talk about responsibility for WWI. Change your wording a bit and you&#39;ll have a correct statement: the first Great War was not 100% Germany&#39;s fault. However, it&#39;s not like Germany didn&#39;t exactly contribute to the onset of the first Great War either. A lot of it can be traced back to the creation of large international alliances, such as the Triple Alliance between Germany, Italy, and Austria-Hungary, orchestrated by none other than German diplomat (and ironically enough, ardent pacifist) Otto von Bismark. Fully explaining all the little intricacies that caused an insignificant Balkan conflict to escalate into the first Great War would take way more space than reddit allows, so I&#39;ll give you the tl;dr version: Every major European nation shares the blame for WWI happening. A large series of complicated alliances with no mind to the wider picture caused two insignificant pieces of clay to be able to instantly plunge the entirety of Europe into conflict. And rather than trying to negotiate peace, the largest nations immediately set about ravaging each other&#39;s lands without even an attempt to avoid such a conflict. Germany&#39;s practice of sanctioning attacks on civilian vessels as part of the practice of unrestricted submarine warfare didn&#39;t help things much.</p>

America is a collection of representatives beholden to the wills of a few rich families. &quot;America&quot; isn&#39;t a nation of people, it&#39;s a sword made of money, wielded by the rich, paid for by the poor, and when the destruction has been wrought, the sword is thrust at the people&#39;s feet as if it was ours all along.

    <div class="md"><p>You aren&#39;t wrong, but on the other hand we&#39;re no Nazi Germany. But we could be made to look like one, with a certain media slant repeated over and over, and certain powerful people made to do things against their will by their owners, to make America look bad. Like a coordinated effort to make america look super bad, no politician would voluntarily do that unless their funding was threatened. </p>

<p>America has done a lot of terrible stuff it needs to be held accountable for, but things can also get exaggerated on top of that and lead to disproportionate retribution in a similar situation to Germany with the war repayments after WW1, is my point. </p>

<p>People might go apeshit on America once things start to go downhill, and turn it in to a truly bad place like how the war reparations destroyed Germany&#39;s economy and quality of living in the 1920s and 30s. Then they went all Nazi and did some <em>real</em> bad shit, and then everyone was cool with bombing them to hell because they were so terrible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think <em>right now</em> the US is more like Germany pre-hyperinflation, and pre- losing a war. So I&#39;d say it&#39;s more like 1912 Germany or something, but we already have crazy debt like Germany did after losing WW1, which is more like early 1920s Germany. So it&#39;s kinda a jumbled comparison in some ways, but long story short, things are not set up to go a good direction. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think anything even close to Nazism has taken over our political sphere, which is why I don&#39;t think we&#39;re like 1930s Germany. No one of importance is calling for genocide of anyone else in America. We have yet to cross that bridge, but I have no doubt it&#39;s coming if the economy and/or stock market crashes again. That&#39;s when the fury at the economic situation gets turned on scapegoats of racism and religious hatred, as Hitler used to great effect in his rise to power. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe you are half right. Historically speaking, that&#39;s exactly what was/is being done. One has to ask oneself, why would the msm so willingly report on America torturing it&#39;s prisoners? We know they censor, so why the black eye. There are many other examples. It&#39;s obvious to me it&#39;s all been carefully choreographed, as you so eloquently stated.</p>

<p>That said, what&#39;s going on now does not appear to be scripted. Putin is sticking it to the zionist plan for a greater israel and the insanity of funding moderate rebels is being forced into American politics. I sincerely doubt this is part of the plan. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for your thoughtful post. Well said, you bring up interesting things to consider. Never forget that &#39;playing the victim&#39; is often Israel&#39;s strongest card. They sometimes create situations where it is &quot;required&quot; for them to react because they feel attacked, that is kind of their M.O. Like last time they attacked Palestine, because some rocket got shot at Israel and landed in an empty field. Then they kill 100 palestinians and blow up just as many buildings.  </p>

<p>You could be right though, it could very well be a large deviation from plan. However I think Putin is approximately as &quot;owned&quot; as the western government is. <em>However</em> Russia does have a very low debt to gdp ratio as seen on <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/Public_debt_percent_gdp_world_map.PNG">this map here</a>. If the control of the government by issuance of currency and creation of debt is the mechanism, then perhaps that mechanism is weakened by Russia having such a very low debt to GDP ratio. Perhaps that gives the zionists less leverage.</p>

<p>But they are stoking the fires of nationalistic conflict between the two nations through their control of the media, and it is largely working. </p>

<p>Zionists have wanted to take Syria for a long time now. A Russian invasion is a great pretext to finally allow the US/Saudi/Israeli/NATO/EU western militaries to move in, because this whole &quot;arming and funding ISIS&quot; crap isn&#39;t working out so hot now that the russians have started acting themselves directly instead of through the syrian government. </p>

<p>And on top of this, if they already control russia to a large extent, who is to say that the russian military entering syria isn&#39;t things going <em>exactly</em> to plan? Just like how Afghanistan was handed over in 1979 from the Russians to the US, like some game of hot potato. Stuff like that makes me think they just want syria to be part of the zionist network, but it doesn&#39;t really matter if Russia does it or the US does it, it&#39;s all the same in the end. They just go with the one that has the more compelling narrative, which is why the US is being demonized and russia is being lauded as a moral hero. Now they can invade syria and look like good guys. </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t have to go exactly according to plan for those in control to win, especially if they already control both sides, all that has to happen is a lot of military fighting that is based on nationalism and a public sense of moral justice about the war derived from media narratives and they&#39;ve got the populace in the bag.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Statism is yet another divide and conquer tactic. The root is the wealthy elite that created the statism.

    <div class="md"><p>I think we&#39;re definitely being painted as the bad guy on purpose. Just like Germany before WW2, yes. Also, just like Bin Laden before 9/11! This type of preparation definitely has a purpose, and I think that purpose is to make us believe in a narrative later, so that everything seems to make sense later when the USA is the known enemy, and we don&#39;t suspect that we&#39;ve been manipulated. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2939ap/its_been_more_than_a_year_since_edward_snowden/cih651z">This guy here</a> has a lot of posts about this subject.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been thinking the same for a while. I even think that they have already planned how maps will look like after the US disintegration. </p>

<p>Recently, Texas has launched it&#39;s own gold-backed bank with it&#39;s own gold reserve. Just like it is in any country in the world, that&#39;s right, COUNTRY, not state. They even made a joke about that in The Simpsons, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsHn4HJRV6U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsHn4HJRV6U</a>
at 00:18 we see someone traveling to the Independent Republic of Texas. I know The Simpsons aren&#39;t a real information source but we&#39;ve seen this kind of predictions before.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I feel that for the last couple years there&#39;s been a lot of this &quot;latino pride&quot; propaganda (I&#39;m Mexican btw). Although immigration has been around for decades, it&#39;s only recently that media has been provoking immigrants to constantly demand more and more from the US government and remembering how part of US used to be Mexico. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconquista_(Mexico)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconquista_(Mexico)</a> and <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2q18dw">http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2q18dw</a> I personally believe this is bullshit and that it has more to do with politics than with human rights. Fun fact: in Mexico we don&#39;t see this people as Mexicans, they have a completely different culture.</p>

<p>And finally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Panarin#Prediction_of_the_United_States_collapse_in_2010">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Panarin#Prediction_of_the_United_States_collapse_in_2010</a> . It obviously hasn&#39;t gone as once predicted but the idea of a US disintegration has been around for a while. </p>

<p>In my opinion, all of this is avoidable. Most people around the world see the US as the new Nazis but I&#39;m sure that if Americans knew all the shit that their government is doing inside and outside US, things would be very different. So if we want to actually do something instead of just watching how everything slowly burns, I think that sharing this ideas and rising awareness could be a first steps.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with everything except the last sentence. We are doing things other governments aren&#39;t doing. We have the world&#39;s largest military by a long long shot, we have 5% of the worlds population but 25% of her prisoners, and then we also have several hundred military bases spanning over 120 countries. This is unique, and it gives the US lots of unique powers. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why they gambled with Britain and France. Even if ethnic Germans were mistreated (extremely dubious) who gives a fuck because Poland suffered a lot worse than other occupied nations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So where&#39;s the part where signing a treaty with Stalin and invading an annexing the sovereign nations of Poland, Austria, and Czechoslovakia are at all justified?</p>

<p>Oh wait - they weren&#39;t. Germany got war declared on it because they signed a peace treaty with a terrorist state and began invading and annexing their neighbors. In general that&#39;s considered to be rather illegal under international law.</p>
