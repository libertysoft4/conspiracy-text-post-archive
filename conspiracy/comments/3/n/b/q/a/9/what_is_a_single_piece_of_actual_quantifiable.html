    <div class="md"><p>It is impossible to prove either way, in the way that one may ask for &quot;proof&quot; of scientifically accepted data. You&#39;re asking people that cannot possibly have such proof at their disposal, to prove something.
Can you prove, with &quot;quantifiable evidence&quot;, that the evidence is not indeed fabricated?
I mean, crap! If there&#39;s no way to apply the scientific method, we must all be the dream of a little autistic boy, right?
Masterdebaters are laughable.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t fall for this tactic, folks. It&#39;s just to waste your time. Plenty of speculation has gone in several directions, and no one theory will explain every little angle. But you know what? I&#39;ve already seen two fake pictures posted on reddit, with a fake account that had manufactured stats (cred), that pushed the mainstream story (which changed already a couple of times). These fake pics were interesting in that they were obviously taken to be used whenever questioned by the public. That means that there is a concerted effort, using somewhat sophisticated techniques and foreplanning, to push a narrative and &quot;debunk&quot; those questioning that narrative. </p>

<p>In the intel world, that would be more than enough &quot;evidence&quot; for mission-go.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The burden of proof isn&#39;t on me, my claim (which is essentially just skepticism towards the false flag/hoax narratives) doesn&#39;t involve a conspiracy of hundreds and perhaps thousands of people from &quot;crisis actors&quot; to law enforcement and even the federal government.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry but mentally unhinged people with access to firearms in America is simply more plausible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. I have already stated it in my general reply to your post. You, however, asked the community at large for evidence. If you want evidence, then spend your time seeking it, and form your opinion, as a civilian should. The tactic of resorting to challenging the public to &quot;debate&quot; issues is preposterous, and shows that your purpose is to either divert public opinion, or to troll. Thanks for the continued push to engage me, though. I like the demonstratable escalations that go along with those cute little charts they print up for 28 year old Colonels that can&#39;t pass three jumps. Buh-bye, now.</p>

Like why was the Canada parliament shooting covered by a dozen press people chilling along the hall to the side nearly next to each other but outside of each others footage.

</blockquote>

<p>No this is completely fallacious. Evidence explains or proves something, inconsistencies or apparent irregularities are not evidence. Situations such as a terrorist attack are far too complicated to be adequately explained by small amounts of  video footage, of course there will be things which appear to have no explanation. It isn&#39;t proof of a conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I think we&#39;re seeing two different things here.</p>

<p>I see someone laughing in the face of tragedy and disaster and at the absurdity of having (or feeling compelled) to announce the death of his daughter on national TV, and then emotional heft of that moment starts sinking in as he does so. You can see it happen.</p>

<p>Ever been to a funeral of a loved one? That loved one may have been dead for a day or so, you may feel you have your shock contained. You may even laugh with friends and family.</p>

<p>And then you have to go up to speak. You keep a handle on your emotions until seconds into your words.</p>

<p>In any case, you&#39;re speculating on a possible motive for what you personally believe to be &quot;bizarre&quot; behavior. You claim it&#39;s an &quot;acting technique&quot;. Neither of these speculations is evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And when people do ask questions about sensitive topics such as this one they get into a whole lot of trouble (see wolfgang halbig). Since you keep asking for the one big piece of evidence which points to foul play ask yourself why the ambulances were forced to wait far away from the school and why proper medical procedures weren&#39;t followed? Also with regards to your first point l, you think investigation is just about asking people and that&#39;s it? You think that whenever an airline goes down the NTSB simply walks in, asks a bunch of questions and then call it a day? This is the reason why I rarely ever post on reddit.

    <div class="md"><p>No, asking questions is <em>part</em> of research, as I have said here before. I don&#39;t understand what your issue with me opening a thread to inquire and debate could possibly be. Nobody is forcing you to engage.</p>

<p>Again, <em>part</em> of research. I don&#39;t know how many ways there are to say it.</p>

<p>I am not at all worried about &quot;getting into trouble&quot;. </p>

<p>I know that active shooter protocol for law enforcement means swarming in and neutralizing a shooter as fast as possible (even if they have to step over the dying to do so), and denying anyone else access to the area until its deemed secure. That can unfortunately mean that medical staff may have to triage outside until law enforcement has declared it absolutely safe to enter.</p>

<p>Active shooter protocol changed since Columbine. Back then law enforcement wouldn&#39;t even raid, they&#39;d secure from outside assuming they would have a negotiation situation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When did I say I had a problem with a thread like this? I have a problem with people asking to provide evidence, while being entirely convinced that they already know the truth. It&#39;s a false sense of openness which people like you have time and time again have pretended to have. And again you&#39;re ignoring the facts. Leaving ambulances several streets away IS NOT normal protocol, before and after columbine. None of the protocols regarding site cleanup were followed either. You&#39;ve also completely missed the point I made about wolfgang halbig (also given the fact that you replied within 10 minutes showed you didn&#39;t even bother reading what happened to him). This conversation really isn&#39;t worth pursuing. Any onlooker who sees this thread will realise you are unable to change your view point, so why bother posting or arguing? You&#39;ve made up your mind and that&#39;s fine, but dont ever try to pretend you are open to changing it. Any onlooker who sees this thread will realise that in an instant. So long</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Halbig is claiming that he is actively being harassed by law enforcement for asking questions about Newtown. Fine. He doesn&#39;t really seem to provide any evidence that he is.</p>

<p>In most pictures and footage, ambulances range from adjacent to the school and eventually lined up down the street. Don&#39;t really know where this &quot;kept streets away&quot; thing is coming from.</p>

<p>Here is documentation of ambulance staging at the adjacent firehouse, and a service report:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The documentation I just shared and news reports show that ambulances arrived at around 10am. So many, in fact, that they were hard to coordinate.</p>

<p>Etc etc</p>

<p>Okay, cleanup. The thing I &quot;ignored&quot;. It&#39;s not like I do things systematically, like an adult. I &quot;ignored&quot; you, riiiight.</p>

<p>Cleanup of the Sandy Hook crime scene was handled by JP Maguire, who do not specifically advertise for crime scene cleanup on their website but do elsewhere:</p>

<p><a href="http://nebula.wsimg.com/ed45300e8e532bb4b72041a0bb740681?AccessKeyId=1EC7452F69C282267CB9&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;disposition=0">http://nebula.wsimg.com/ed45300e8e532bb4b72041a0bb740681?AccessKeyId=1EC7452F69C282267CB9&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;disposition=0</a></p>

<p>Trauma cleanup in Connecticut does not require the licensing or &quot;protocol&quot; (you may need to be more specific about that) of other states, take that for what you may.</p>

<p>To further prove how little I&#39;m reading, or maybe how little you are, all your points seem to lead to one particular kook Jim Fetzer who seems to think that Sandy Hook might be real, but that the kids could have been murdered by Israeli Mossad:</p>

Then there is the photo of people walking with their hands up in front of the media. Why are there hands up when the gunman killed himself? Where is the footage from security cameras like the actual school shooting columbine? Where is the camera photo footage, fb posts &amp; tweets while people were hiding behind desks?

    <div class="md"><p>Sandy hook was a drill gone live. It was an abandoned school. Google maps shows no cars in carpark while nearby schools all have full carparks. You didn&#39;t see the bodies. Photos of the school show that it had experienced flooding &amp; the walls were stained with mould (what parent/admin would accept this). But the most damning piece of evidence is the FBI how many victims of shootings for the area that year; answer 0. OF course they have had time to change the details to fit but the fact it was missing remains.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, an overhead photo of an empty parking lot (weekends, holidays, spring, fall, winter, summer break) is evidence of an unused school?</p>

<p>What would have been the purpose of an unused school, to fill with crisis actor children one day to fake a shooting?</p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t that indeed make all the <em>children</em> in photos and footage of that day complicit? Do you not see how silly this all is?</p>

<p>These are fairly normal looking, non-fire hazard classrooms to me. <em>shrug</em></p>

<p>The one with the hallway, someone moved stuff into the hallway. And? You&#39;re saying that this inoperative fake school was filled with school supplies and kids artwork?</p>

<p>I mean, classrooms move around sometimes. Sometimes classrooms have to be deep cleaned. There are much more plausible explanations than a dummy school full of school supplies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The school holidays are when classrooms get deep cleaned, repainted etc. That first pic looks like a normal classroom in itself. If you are going to fake a school you will need some school supplies. That being said your explanation is just as plausible as mine.

    <div class="md"><p>Well, your explanation is a fake school created by... somebody (intelligence agencies? FEMA? Obama? Mossad?) in order to create a fake mass shooting involving hundreds of actors.</p>

<p>Mine is that it was closed the day that picture was taken, and that in 2008 they cleaned it of asbestos.</p>

<p>Which one sounds more plausible?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That only sounds intriguing from afar on the internet. Do you realize how silly that sounds?

    <div class="md"><p>Anyone can claim to be from the town. And those there on the day will all claim to be from town. Even if you went there yourself &amp; started asking around it wouldn&#39;t help. You would have feds following you within an hr. And even if you heard the truth you wouldn&#39;t be certain it was true. Physical evidence is better. Perhaps if you found someone in a photo from say the local paper years before then you could trust their answer.</p>

<p>Edit: I have no doubt many wouldn&#39;t be afraid to tell you the truth. But like that guy would the CIA killed; his neighbours reported black vans before &amp; after the shooting &amp; media/gov reported it as a suicide. Anyone who gets listened to too much is silenced.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course not. Only those who knew the school was shut down years earlier would have known it wasn&#39;t real in retrospective. Thousands of people who attended legitimate funerals like Robbie Parkers one which witnesses describe as weird. When you can fake mass killings, fake coroner reports, create fake masks why would you bury an empty casket? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is only speculation &amp; discrepancies at this point &amp; shall remain like that for a while I suspect. What triggered my suspicion was I 3 media stories calling for gun control after latest shooting before I saw a single article telling me about the shooting &amp; what state it had occurred in. Then there is the photo of people walking with their hands up in front of the media. Why are there hands up when the gunman killed himself? Where is the footage from security cameras like the actual school shooting columbine? Where is the camera photo footage, fb posts &amp; tweets while people were hiding behind desks? How come so many of them appear to have colour coded outfits on? How did the white house have a press conference minutes after the shooting calling it out &amp; gun control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mfw you literally just confirmed the fact that you are too lazy to do your own research. Just like any conspiracy it&#39;s a combination of many different elements (think 911). For example I already told you before, police dash cam footage in front of the school shows absolutely nobody exiting. Footage from above the school from helicopters shows people walking around in a giant circle, with no purpose whatsoever. If you are unwilling to sit down for a day or even a week doing your own research dont expect anyone to show you any respect. </p>
