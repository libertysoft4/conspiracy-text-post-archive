<p>Can someone explain why a post of such dubious approval was stickied to begin with, and why it has been up since the middle of fricking September?</p>

<p>I think everybody has seen it by now. Anybody who wishes to input their views has already done so. It&#39;s long since failed to be interesting in any way.</p>

<p>Let it go, or create anti-vaccine reddit and sticky it there where anybody who hasn&#39;t seen it yet can refer to it until the end of time.</p>

<p>Time to take that thing down.</p>

<p>such dubious approval</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, it&#39;s an extremely well-written and well-researched post. It was also very well received. Did you even read the comments?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the funny thing:</p>

<p>I <em>almost</em> removed this sticky just this morning. However, we tend to not let stickies last for more than 14 days, and since this was day 13 I figured I&#39;d let it stay until the evening.</p>

<p>If you had waited a few hours it would&#39;ve been gone. </p>

<p>Instead, you had to go the drama route. Great. Well done.</p>

<p>You realize, <em>you could&#39;ve just messaged the mods</em>. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey guys, that sticky is almost 2 weeks old and has overstayed its welcome, how about taking it down?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Easy as pie.</p>

<p>Why complain first? It&#39;s just silly.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s why that post was featured for so long (and why similar posts will be featured in the future): Original content is what makes this sub great. </p>

<p>When someone puts a great deal of effort into a quality post for the sole benefit of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, they should be rewarded with more exposure.</p>

<p>The more folks that see original content get featured, the more that will be inspired to step up and share their own research.</p>

<p>I know from personal experience. When I saw Three_Letter_Agency&#39;s legendary pedophilia post, I was extremely inspired and begin to do my own research for <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>We&#39;re a community, and we can only survive if we support each other.</p>

<p>That being said, I&#39;ve removed the sticky =P</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This means nothing.</p>

<p>DEWs were not used to take the towers down, and if they WERE used they were used only as an adjunct.</p>

<p>It&#39;s quite clear that both buildings were taken down by nuclear munitions buried 70-100ft under the lowest basements, as evidenced by the <strong>70,000</strong> first responders and people in the area that day who now have leukemias, bone cancers, thyroid cancers, and brain tumors. Most could have ONLY have been caused by exposure to ionizing radiation.</p>

<p>The 150kt nuclear devices left nice cavities for the buildings to fall into--else the debris piles world have been 50 feet high. They also vaporized EVERYTHING--bodies, computers, steel beams, concrete, etc. Only nuclear munitions can BEGIN to do that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps it was both nukes and DEW. Perhaps it was a combination of everything. I&#39;m open to that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, just the way I write!!</p>

<p>And I think you&#39;re right; nukes took them down but DEWs were probably tuned to the resonant frequency of the towers to make the nuke aspect not look so obvious.</p>

<p>Let me also state, I can&#39;t say how, that I KNOW that DEWs exist...but when I gained my experience they were still being used to try to take out birds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, one of the mods has just posted three of his own, one of them being related to the topic. I sense he hates vaccines, which may be a reason. I&#39;m all for a good bit of info, but there has been a real lack of good stuff on this subfor the past two days. Another vaccine post isn&#39;t really all that valuable, IMO. I am against the current state of vaccines, by the way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My guess is that it&#39;s either literally an alt for one of the admins or is a &quot;sanctioned&quot; power user who&#39;s given a ton of control over the subs he mods.  It could also be a team or group of people using the account.</p>

<p>But the fact that the account still exists after all of the proven propaganda and shilling and censorship and bullshit it&#39;s been involved in tells me that it&#39;s being fully allowed to continue existing by the admins.  There is no logical way they can claim that they aren&#39;t aware of the shit BPB has been involved with over the years.</p>
