<p>The United States occupies a dominant position on the global stage, but most people do not believe this position came about (or is maintained) via violent force. If you ask the average citizen, the age of Imperialism is basically over. We live in more enlightened times, have a democratic system that functions relatively well, and do not openly talk about conquering foreign lands. People assume that the United States basically wants to do good in the world, and see events like the Iraq War as isolated instances of corruption and negligence rather than part of any unified strategy to project U.S. power abroad. I believe this ‘standard’ view of United States foreign policy is incorrect and that we are, in reality, an empire no different than Rome. </p>

<p><strong>Empire</strong></p>

<p>Before we begin, I think it’s important to get a working definition of ‘empire.’ For me, empires are systems of governance in which states seek to prosper by dominating the people, land, and resources of neighboring territories. Empires expand and contract over time based on how well they do in competition against other empires. A classic example we all studied in Middle School was the Roman Empire. Rome began as a single city on the Italian peninsula and then, after many brutal military campaigns, became immensely wealthy and grew to take over most of modern day Europe and North Africa. </p>

<p>We assume the modern day United States would never function like Rome. Dominating foreign lands and people seems old fashioned and morally wrong. </p>

<p><strong>The Truth</strong></p>

<p>Like Rome, the United States began small and expanded outwards via constant warfare. We fought the British in 1776 and 1812, the Mexicans in 1846, and hundreds of independent Native American states along the way. These wars allowed us to expand from a narrow foothold on the Eastern seaboard to the sprawling 3,000 mile wide country we have today. </p>

<p>By the early 20th century, the United States had consolidated a large chunk of the North American landmass and thus began looking towards overseas territories for further expansion opportunities. I think this point of history (the early 20th century) is where confusion begins to arise. We are hit with a ton of propaganda that tries to reorient how we think about the recent past. History textbooks characterize pre-World War II U.S. foreign policy as ‘isolationist’ despite the fact that we violently intervened in many countries during this time period. United States Marine Corps Major General Smedley Butler, one of the most decorated marines of all time, wrote in 1935: </p>

<p>I spent 33 years and four months in active military service and during that period I spent most of my time as a high class muscle man for Big Business, for Wall Street and the bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism. I helped make Mexico and especially Tampico safe for American oil interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street. I helped purify Nicaragua for the International Banking House of Brown Brothers in 1902-1912. I brought light to the Dominican Republic for the American sugar interests in 1916. I helped make Honduras right for the American fruit companies in 1903. In China in 1927 I helped see to it that Standard Oil went on its way unmolested. Looking back on it, I might have given Al Capone a few hints. The best he could do was to operate his racket in three districts. I operated on three continents. (1)</p>

<p><strong>Today</strong></p>

<p>Nothing has changed to this day; in fact, the empire is bigger than ever before. It is rarely talked about in the mainstream media, but the United States has a network of over 700 military bases around the world. (2) Speaking about the difference between Russia and the Untied States, Vladimir Putin told an interviewer, “I invite you to publish the world map in your newspaper and to mark all the US military bases on it. You will see the difference.” (3) When these bases do come up, Americans seem to assume they are mostly harmless relics from World War II that do not play an important role in global politics. This is completely incorrect. Just like every other empire in history, the U.S. uses bases to dominate resources and nations. Iran is completely <a href="http://www.juancole.com/2012/02/ring-of-iranian-bases-threatens-us.html">surrounded</a>. </p>

<p>We have 38,000 troops in Germany and 49,000 troops in Japan (4), countries we have occupied since we beat them on the battlefield in World War II. These nations are not allowed to have independent militaries. Imagine if a foreign country had thousands of troops in the United States and prevented us from having a military industrial complex that rakes in billions of dollars each year! </p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>There is no country, only an empire. The United States government has divided the world into ten <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Combatant_Command#/media/File:Unified_Combatant_Commands_map.png">command centers</a> each headed by a 4-star (or above) general. The military works to promote U.S. corporate interests abroad and, when it can get away with it, will invade and occupy weaker nations. </p>

<p>In this post, it was not my intention to take a side and declare if this system is good or bad. Rather, I just want to raise awareness about the true nature of global politics. Many of the points I&#39;ve mentioned here aren&#39;t even brought up during debates or on talk shows and I think that needs to change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a really great little book called &#39;Are We Rome?&#39; which examines this issue in detail. Supringly there were over a hundred different reasons why Rome ended the way it did, and not the ones ones commonly listed today (sexual deviance etc). Among the main causes for collapse were: Corrupt governments that sold off public works to private interests, military over-reach, uncontrolled immigration and Apocalyptic Christianity  (followers refused to make any efforts on behalf of Rome and ran up huge debts in anticipation of Christ&#39;s immediate return). These sound familiar?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes they did. For the first few centuries of empire, the Roman Legion was the equivalent to a nuclear weapon. The so-called Pax Romana was based on the Legions annihilating your country if you didn&#39;t toe the line. Then the filthy barbarians got their hands on similar tech and it all went downhill... until (Eastern) Rome adopted a new nuke in the form of heavily armoured warhorses that would dominate the battlefield for centuries.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No not really. If any one date could be said to mark Romes fall it would be 410 when Alaric the Visigoth sacked the city. But leading up to that date Rome lost many small battles which weakened it militarily. The USA has been constantly at war somewhere since WW2 ended but has not won a war in 70 years! From Vietnam to Afghanistan American forces went home with nothing to show for their sacrifices. You can&#39;t use nukes on scattered tribes or terrorists. The overall impression now is America is weak and can&#39;t secure its territories, foreign interests or borders. Like ancient Rome, death by a thousand cuts is a real danger!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Before Washington, DC was conceptualized the hill where the Capitol now stands was called <a href="http://ghostsofdc.org/2014/02/11/washington-originally-called-rome/">Rome</a> and the Potomac was actually called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiber_Creek">Tiber</a>   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A long time ago, way before the city was in the thoughts of our founding fathers, back in the 17th century, there was a large estate in the area of about 400 acres. This farm occupied the land southeast of Georgetown (then, a part of Maryland). The man who owned the land was fond of Italy and decided to name the estate Rome, in honor of the city. The small body of water bordering it to the south was originally called Goose Creek, but then took the new name, Tiber Creek (i.e., after the The Tiber in Rome). Of course, the story wouldn’t be complete without mentioning that the landowner’s name happened to be Francis Pope.</p>

<p>According to an article I came across in The Washington Post from October 7th, 1883, the land was laid out and acquired by Pope on June 5th, 1663. Also, legend has it, that Francis was very proud of his ingenious naming scheme, often telling anyone who’d listen that America had its own Rome on the Tiber, and a Pope lived there.</p>

The capitol used to be in Philadelphia but was moved by the influence of the Carrol family so that the Jesuits could oversee the capitol from Georgetown University (founded by the Jesuit John Carrol). Every major city has a Jesuit University near its capitol. We see it in Washington, London, Munich, etc.  All of the major intelligence and policy advisers in the US are Jesuit-trained, most from Georgetown. The Jesuits absolutely are planning on destroying this nation and it will be part of the Fourth Reich as part of the Third Thirty Years War. The first Reich was the Holy Roman Empire which was unofficially started by Charlemagne. The Second Reich was the Kaiser Reich. The Third Reich was Nazi Germany which was aligned with the other axis powers. The USA, EU and UN/NATO will be part of the new axis powers analogous to those of the Second World War and they will fail by design. The new world powers will be sought to be established in the Middle East and Far East.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent article. One thing you didn&#39;t mention (either in an attempt to censor or simply due to a lack of knowledge) is the way the Roman Empire collapsed, and how the source of its collapse is happening in the US.</p>

<p>You see the story of the Roman empire collapse was because of many tribes (like the vandals, goths, etc.) attacking Rome when it was weak. That&#39;s true, but no one seems to wanna say why it got weak. Many say overexpansion but that was NOT the case.</p>

<p>For most of Rome&#39;s existence there was a simple concept. Serve in the military and you get &quot;citizenship&quot; so because of that simple concept many enlisted in the hopes that they live through the service and can live out the rest of their lives as respected Romans. One day a progressive emperor came along (cant remember his name) and he gave everyone citizenship, regardless of military service. This saw a steep drop in enlistments. Why would most risk dying in the army when there was no longer any reward (citizenship). Because of the Roman army being small and undermanned, the barbarian tribes had no problem overcoming them.</p>

<p>We are seeing this happen too. The world is volatile and politicians want to strip the US military. They want to strip funding for vital defense spending so lazy fucks can get welfare and free this or free that. Education and healthcare is important yes, but NOT when you have to sacrifice an army to afford it. If we continue to defund the army we will collapse like Rome. Our enemies (Russia, China, Iran, and NK) circle like hawks, waiting for weakness to strike.</p>

<p>TL;DR: Rome used to give citizenship to those that joined the army, an emperor gave everyone citizenship, few joined the army, Rome got taken over due to tiny army. US defunding army....the cycle repeats?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A poor copy it then <del>exports to</del> inflicts upon the rest of the world. I don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like in other countries, but in Australia we will often have the original version almost side-by-side with the US remake. While this will usually happen on different channels (<em>Homeland</em> is broadcast on Network 10, but the Israeli original is broadcast on SBS, for example), we occasionally have things like <em>Cold Case</em> where the Canadian series was aired straight after the US remake for a couple of seasons. When you see the shows almost side-by-side like that you can really appreciate just how good the good remakes are, at the same time it highlights that the bad remakes are often truly horrific.</p>
