<p>That&#39;s the size of an average honey bee farm. Wouldn&#39;t it just be easier, to set a farm ablaze, over taking out multiple trucks?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well if you don&#39;t want to kill all of them off quickly, so you make it look like an accident. I assume the less bee population there is the harder and more expensive it will be to get your fields pollinated driving up food cost.
Then companies that can create self pollinating GMO&#39;s can step in and save the day and sell cheaper products. The consumer drives out the competition by going with the cheaper alternative all while becoming reliant on said products. Next thing you know farms that needed bees to pollinate start taking hits. They either 1- downsize crops so they can afford to pollinate them, 2- go out of business due to too much competition, or 3- give in to big corporations and start using their plants that will self-pollinate all while paying them royalties for their patented plant seeds thus putting a choke hold on the industry to where only the biggest of corporations can afford to stay in the business.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What are you talking about? Are you serious with this truck-crash-bees-genocide nonsense? </p>

<p>We are talking about bees. You can smoke them, spray them, trap them in sugary water... You don&#39;t have to crash a truck. You don&#39;t have to hide the evidence. Hell, bees have been dying off for over a decade. Check colony collapse disorder (CCD). You could spray 200M bees with the poision today and the worse that would happen would be another bullet point in some CCD statistics</p>

<p>So rather than a bee elimination conspiracy, this seems to be a conspiracy to release bees from captivity</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, that was true for a few of the trucks. Some of the bees were recaptured and taken back. However in one of the stories I think they said they sprayed to kill them off to protect the highway, and in another story (I think an Idaho one) they estimated the bees would most likely be dead within a day or two with the certain climate and without their hives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those numbers got me curious as they seemed a little high, but some Googling (and learning <em>way</em> too much about the transport of bees) shows numbers like that to be reasonable.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/transportation/rolled-semi-spills-load-of-bees-at-the-i-5-and-i-405-interchange/">This recent story</a> out of Washington State actually included some interesting facts about the transit of bees. Things such as how they are only transported at night when the bees are less active and how this time of year there are massive amounts of bees being moved around for agriculture use, both of which could be contributing factors in the occurrence of accidents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok let me try.</p>

<p>monsanto wants to own our entire food supply.  </p>

<p>They have already introduced their poison into farmers fields who do not use their products.  </p>

<p>Take corn in Mexico for example, shitty monsanto crap and chemicals get blown/bee&#39;ed/etc to other natural fields. Pesticides are killing off bees, and what happens when there&#39;s no more bees? No more food?  I don&#39;t think so.  I think they, or someone owns a patent for plant growing and fertilization by a bee-less method of some type.  </p>

<p>So, once bees die off, so do our fields of the past. Now vertical fields can be moved in place. </p>

<p>Those can&#39;t have bees, too messy and abnormal of an environment.  Instead, you have to use their bee-machine replacement.  Oh! forgot to mention, vertical farms only support this tech, not the old bee-less fields we now have.</p>

<p>The new, expensive-to-get-into vertical farming industry.  The one where all the established are connected to Montsano, Dupont, etc, coincidentally.</p>

<p>Enjoy your old square land fields you can&#39;t farm on with their poison saturated into them, with no bees to carry pollen for you anymore anyway.</p>

<p>Or, I don&#39;t know... I&#39;m not <a href="/u/Supertact">/u/Supertact</a> I&#39;m just saying this is <a href="/r/conspiracy/">/r/conspiracy/</a> and i think it&#39;s ok here to get a bit creative here. :)</p>
