<p>TL;DR: how can weed become legal when tobacco companies would lose money?</p>

<p>The reason why texting while driving is still legal is because large companies such as Verizon, AT&amp;T, Sprint, etc are lobbying to keep it legal because a large % of revenue is made by people texting while driving. So how in the world can pot become legal when tobacco companies are many billion times richer (therefore can decide if it becomes legal or not).
Wouldn&#39;t they lose millions of dollars?</p>

<p>Please don&#39;t say that the tobacco companies will start selling marijuana because that is a very uneducated answer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) Your TL;DR is longer than the text that preceded it.</p>

<p>2) How do Verizon and the others make money specifically from people texting and driving? I&#39;m unaware of any phone plans that do not include unlimited texting. How does texting while driving make more money than texting while not driving?</p>

<p>3) Any proof that Verizon and others lobby specifically for keeping texting and driving legal? I&#39;m pretty sure texting and driving is illegal in my state.</p>

<p>4) Why is assuming that tobacco companies trying to make money off of selling weed &quot;uneducated?&quot;</p>

<p>TL;DR: No offense, but what are you talking about?</p>

<li><p>I put my TL;DR at the top, the whole paragraph isn&#39;t a tldr....</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;Companies lobby to keep texting legal&quot; literally the first Google result is an article. You should do research before you reply.</p></li>
<li><p>It&#39;s uneducated because it&#39;s the first answer everyone says. If you do the most basic of math, you&#39;ll see that the money they lose on weed becoming legal is much more than the money they&#39;ll make</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>1) So... you just decided to format your post completely opposite to the norm. 10-4.</p>

<p>2) Should I? Or should you perhaps better articulate yourself and include some links that support your statements? I didn&#39;t start the thread, you did. And it looks like you spent about 3 minutes worth of effort on it. It might as well be one of those &quot;look at my cat, I&#39;m so unique&quot; posts.</p>

<p>3) So if I ask everyone &quot;What heavenly body orbits our planet?&quot;, and they all say, &quot;the moon&quot;, it&#39;s automatically an uneducated answer? I don&#39;t know if we have math to look at with regards to a situation that has never happened, and while I&#39;d make a point to avoid weed sold by tobacco companies in the event it became legal, I have little doubt millions of other Americans would buy from their already preferred brands. Again, I don&#39;t believe you have any actual data to support this idea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your question rests on an unproven assumption ie. that tobacco companies <em>would</em> lose money after legalization.</p>

<p>Is there any evidence for this? The only evidence would come from an analysis of tobacco sales before and after legalization. It&#39;s still too soon to say if there has been a noticeable difference.</p>

<p>As for weed becoming legal, or being &quot;allowed&quot;. Maybe the politicians realize that the demographics have changed. Every year, an ever-increasing % of voters are in favor of legalization. If a politician that picks the right time and place to support legalization has a better chance of getting elected... that politician <em>will</em> support legalization.</p>

<p>Most opposition to legalization comes from the older generations of voters. They aren&#39;t a numerical majority, but most of them vote. We probably would have legal weed in a lot more states (and countries) if more young people got out and voted the same way older people do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree dude, that and cash strapped local govts are amiable to suggestions for easy sources of money. Lets face it, its a tax no one who buys weed will mind paying, so no pain in introducing it, and if &quot;the people&quot; themselves make the decision via referenda so much the better for the govt, they don&#39;t have to pretend about morality bullshit, they can say &quot;not our decision&quot;. Basically its a win-win for the end-user and the govt getting proceeds. Only problems will be for the various pushers, like alcohol companies. Why the original poster thinks tobacco, as opposed to alcohol or pharma, would be worried by the legalization of weed is odd...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what I was thinking as well. However since tobacco is addictive and alcohol prohibition proved a mistake, I doubt any law against tobacco will ever pass. </p>

<p>Also, that&#39;s a good thought, however I think LSD will come closer to being a weapon than weed. (Though that may be the point)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How the hell could lsd be a weapon? They already tried for that and it proved to do the opposite of what they wanted. Lsd was one of the defining things that woke me up. It helps you see the dots so that your mind can connect them. Lsd would just create a bunch of loving, caring, sharing people. It would erase the imaginary boundaries between &quot;different types&quot; of people. It helps you to see that we are all the same, and we only have one planet to share between us. Maybe bath salts or some shit, but no psychedelic would help their cause.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, in my state it is actually illegal to text and drive. You technically cant even look at the screen to check who is texting/calling. But anyhow,</p>

<p>I think weed is bdcoming legal because the People have finally reached the critical mass to begin such movements in politics. Enough of  the People have realized that marijuanas safety is many times greater than that of alcohol or tobacco (admittingly, it is stil not 100% safe). Enough of the People have realized that it can be used as a medicine to provide natural relief to those suffering. Enough have risen up and spoken out. </p>

<p>Now, if we csn reach critical mass like thst on more important issues, maybe we can take back our country from our own government...</p>

<p>Thr tobacco companies and pander and peddle all they want. But their millions is no match for a cognizant populace. See, theres the key. If the People remained ignorant and relied on their (fake) representation to take over their wellbeing without accountability, than the situation where the tobacco companies could actuslly make a big infkuence. But, when the people become knowledgable and wiser, the companies lose their leverage.</p>

<p>They say an ignorant populace is a controlled populace. A populace that is wise and knowledgable is a threat to tyranny -- always.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, i think what we shoukd be looking at is big pharma. Theyre not going to accept marijuanas medicinal properties thst make many of their synthetic poisons obsolete. Big Pharma is the group thats going to be lobbying to the FDA to keep marijuana illegal, as they have been doing. </p>

<p>If you look deep enough, big pharma and the fda begin to become inseperable entities, in terms of ideology, methods, motives, and purpose.</p>
