<p>Your attempt to muddy the waters won&#39;t work. Specific types of conversations are not the issue here at all. For example this is Conspiracy so we don&#39;t talk about specific types of things like &#39;Old Time Radio&#39; unless there is some kind of conspiracy.

<p>The rules of r/conspiracy specifically do not allow certain types of conversations about conspiracies, conspiracy theorists, and the sub in general.</p>

<p>So yes, the same as the world history sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or I realize subs are ran by diffrent groups and you gotta know where speech ain&#39;t free. That said, I get your point. It&#39;s a form of protest.

    <div class="md"><p>I won&#39;t speak for OP. But i don&#39;t think it is a sign of protest so much as it is using the subs for the purpose they were intended. There really shouldn&#39;t be anything radical about posting about the Belfour declaration in world history. It shouldn&#39;t <strong>be considered</strong> a protest, I think that is the point. </p>

<p>The alternative I think is to internalize the idea that censorship is OK or that &#39;speech ain&#39;t free&#39;. To accept it and move on, which I think is dangerous. Thinking like that will condition you to eventually limit your thoughts, let alone your words. &quot;Why bother saying anything, they&#39;ll just ban me?&quot; really quickly turns into &quot;why bother thinking about it, I can&#39;t talk about it.&quot; </p>

<p>I think posting about it here is because this is a sub dedicated to people who are against those sorts of tactics of censorship and open discussion. It&#39;s a kind of group therapy for people who don&#39;t think asking questions should be denied and censorship should be accepted. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was my comment:</p>

<p>The truth is because the Jews sold Germany out to the allies. They made a deal with England. In return for American involvement, England is to promise the Jews the land of Palestine. This deal is known as the Balfour Declaration. Germany was winning the war and was calling a truce, as well as an agreement that no one pays reparations. The only problem with that is the Jewish bankers are financing this war and they need the reparations paid to make money. The Lusitania sinking was confirmed to be a false flag attack 80 years later.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>germany was winning the war </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No they weren&#39;t. Germany was exhausted, undermanned and out-equipped by the final years of the war. Britain had managed to create a modern army who took full advantage of the concept of combined arms. Germany&#39;s stalwart defense and strong military tradition gave way to modern technology and advanced combat doctrine. A three-year naval blockade certainly didn&#39;t help things either.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a reason why Heinz Guderian, one of the most brilliant generals of the 20th century studied the British offensives from 1917 onward.  Kesselring and Rommel too studied the combined-arms attacks made by the British during the second half of the war. </p>

<p>Even on a larger scale, most German offensives through the entirety of the war fell short-mostly ending in strategic or tactical defeat. When Von Hindenburg was been placed in charge in 1916 he immediately began drawing up plans for a large scale withdrawal.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and was calling a truce</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Calling a truce doesn&#39;t mean much other than &quot;stop pummelling me&quot;. Calling a truce makes no statement towards your posture or future considerations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Lusitania sinking was confirmed to be a false flag attack 80 years later.</p>

<p>lol by who? I&#39;m not sure you understand what false flag means.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve been on Reddit for three years. Presumably at least some of that has been spent on r/conspiracy, since you&#39;re posting here now. So I have a hard time believing you&#39;ve never seen complaints like this here, seeing as they are common.</p>

<p>From this week alone:</p>

<p>And that&#39;s just the overt submissions using the word &quot;banned.&quot; There are plenty more complaints in comments or that use different phrasing. It&#39;s a common enough complaint here so that <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2zfkxd/has_this_sub_become_about_whining_because_youve/">it&#39;s been noticed before</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow dude, you just wasted a lot of time for no reason. </p>

<p>How would you know what I saw or did not see? I bet you are the type of person who asks someone their name, they would say Jon and you would be like, &#39;really, Jon? I thought it was Mike, are you sure it is not Mike?&#39;. Those people are annoying.</p>

<p>Maybe if I browse new I would have seen it, but no I have never seen these before. If it is happening so much, then the it is up to the mods to make a rule about it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was my comment:</p>

<p>The truth is because the Jews sold Germany out to the allies. They made a deal with England. In return for American involvement, England is to promise the Jews the land of Palestine. This deal is known as the Balfour Declaration. Germany was winning the war and was calling a truce, as well as an agreement that no one pays reparations. The only problem with that is the Jewish bankers are financing this war and they need the reparations paid to make money. The Lusitania sinking was confirmed to be a false flag attack 80 years later.</p>

<p>Edit: Just want to state that these &#39;jews&#39; are not really Jews, but hide behind the Jewish faith.
They call themselves Jews but they are not, but are of the Synagogue of Satan.</p>
