        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I notice my new posts are now no longer appearing, which I&#39;m guessing means I&#39;m shadow banned.</p>

<p>Skeptics, people who are supposed to calmly look at evidence from both sides of the argument in an unbias fashion and come to a conclusion based solely on evidence. Yet, I am banned for the following posts, which I think you&#39;ll find are perfectly reasonable and added some interesting debate to an otherwise circlejerking echochamber. This is pathetic.</p>

<p>The incriminating posts:</p>

<p>Why do they need to provide an alternative theory?</p>

<p>By definition, if there has been a cover up, then the details of what actually happened have been covered up, ie not accessible to the public.</p>

<p>Lets say I&#39;m on a jury. I&#39;m being told that a guy from the other side of the country, has broken into someones house and murdered them by stabbing. This house has the worlds most advanced security system, who only the police had the capability to get through.</p>

<p>In fact police were patrolling the premises at the time and were warned of the break in, yet records show they were walking around in the opposite direction at the time of the stabbing. I notice that the accused has no arms and no legs, and is incredibly sick, stuck to a dialysis machine. He is a very wealthy businessman, who appears to have not benefited at all by breaking into the house. The police have confiscated his Lamborghini Murcialago and are driving it around proudly. They are also auctioning off the rest of his possessions and appear to be doing very well.</p>

<p>No evidence has been provided that the armless man committed the crime. Despite confiscating over 80 videos showing the attack, only one grainy video, which appears edited and doesnt show much in particular, has been provided. We are only going on the police&#39;s word that this man committed the attack.</p>

<p>Now, to me on the jury, this is a ridiculous story. The man is clearly innocent. I do my job, and declare him not guilty.</p>

<p>As a juror, it is not my job to provide the evidence of what actually happened. I have no idea. As is the case with 9/11. The government needs to prove to us what happened, and frankly I think they&#39;ve done an incredibly poor job akin to the Warren Commission report on JFK.</p>

<hr/>

<p>0.03 seconds? NIST says 2.25 seconds.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nist.gov/el/disasterstudies/wtc/faqs_wtc7.cfm">Stage 2 (1.75 to 4.0 seconds): gravitational acceleration (free fall)</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>Well I cant say I&#39;m impressed. Anyone can go around and hassle some laymen who are clearly not the sharpest knives in the drawer, compile the worst of them and put them in a video. As he said himself, he was talking to people for 3 hours. Is this what being a &#39;skeptic&#39; is about? Hassling some uneducated people to make yourself feel superior and reinforce what you already believe? </p>

<p>Furthermore, he&#39;s disputing the freefall even when even <a href="http://www.nist.gov/el/disasterstudies/wtc/faqs_wtctowers.cfm">NIST admits there was freefall.</a></p>

<p>Has he ever addressed any of the questions posed in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DOnAn_PX6M">this video?</a></p>

<p>Does this guy actually take on any academics on the subject? </p>

<hr/>

<p>Maybe you can start in the video below. I havn&#39;t yet seen answers to these questions so I&#39;d very much like to hear your thoughts.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DOnAn_PX6M">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DOnAn_PX6M</a></p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>Of course you&#39;re not impressed. You&#39;re a true believer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You really shouldnt start by bullying or insulting me, because frankly you lose the debate right there.</p>

<p>However, I do find it ironic that I am considered a &#39;true believer&#39; simply for not believing the story that on September 11, 19 men armed with boxcutters directed by a man on dialysis in a cave fortress halfway around the world using a satellite phone and a laptop directed the most sophisticated penetration of the most heavily-defended airspace in the world, overpowering the passengers and the military combat-trained pilots on 4 commercial aircraft before flying those planes wildly off course for over an hour without being molested by a single fighter interceptor.</p>

<p>These 19 hijackers, devout religious fundamentalists who liked to drink alcohol, snort cocaine, and live with pink-haired strippers, managed to knock down 3 buildings with 2 planes in New York, while in Washington a pilot who couldn’t handle a single engine Cessna was able to fly a 757 in an 8,000 foot descending 270 degree corskscrew turn to come exactly level with the ground, hitting the Pentagon in the budget analyst office where DoD staffers were working on the mystery of the 2.3 trillion dollars that Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld had announced “missing” from the Pentagon’s coffers in a press conference the day before, on September 10, 2001.</p>

<p>If I&#39;m some nutjob for believing that this cannot be done without inside help, well sure, call me crazy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you watch any of his other protest interview videos, you&#39;ll see he really goes out of his way to help the people express their views and give them the benefit of the doubt. He even addresses your issue here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Never the less, these are just laypeople at a rally. Not experts. Their arguments hardly represent the best case for an inside job.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As for free-fall, did you not see the video of the twin towers falling? You can see huge chunks of building falling faster than the rest of the building. Explain that, if you will.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No I didnt see that, please link to it. I mean, NIST themselves say the towers collapsed at &#39;near free fall speed&#39; so I&#39;m not sure what the debate is here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>God. Who has time to sit through more than four hours of conspiracy theory video? True believers, of course.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nice insult there. Well, according to the first hit on google the average American watches <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/average-american-watches-5-hours-tv-day-article-1.1711954">5 hours of television per day</a>. So, presumably most Americans have time to watch it. But of course, a highly detailed and complex, complete confirmation that the US government was involved in the most deadly attack on civilans in US history is just stupid and boring compared to the Kardashians. </p>

<p>I spent 15 minutes watching your guy make fun of stupid people, so perhaps you could spend at least 15 minutes watching mine? If you cant answer the questions posed perhaps you will be compelled to watch more. Its only the length of two hollywood movies, easy to watch over the course of the week and I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll find it interesting. You&#39;re better to start 10 minutes in, as the start is just comparing 9/11 with the attack on Pearl Harbour.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Does he take on any academics? If by academics you mean &quot;people with credentials specializing in subjects outside of catastrophic building collapses,&quot; yes he has.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By academics I mean the definition of academics. Do you have a link to the videos where he is debating with these academics on the subject?</p>

<hr/>

<p>Maybe just give it 20 minutes and see what you think? I cant do bullet points as it presents all the evidence (actual audio, testimonies) and then asks the question.</p>

<p>This is probably the best and most complete picture of the questions &#39;truthers&#39; have about the actual events on the day (though doesnt go into the money trail or other factors which point toward a conspiracy), so I&#39;d be disappointed if a so called &#39;skeptic&#39; didn&#39;t listen to some of the points.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Interestingly, by attacking the man Ad Hominem you are breaking one of Michael Shermers own fallacies of skeptical thinking. Straight from the horses book:</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Ad Hominem and Tu Quoque</li>
</ol>

<p>Literally &quot;to the man&quot; and &quot;you also,&quot; these fallacies redirect the focus from thinking about the idea to thinking about the person holding the idea. The goal of an ad hominem attack is to discredit the claimant in hopes that it will discredit the claim. Calling someone an atheist, a communist, a child abuser, or a neo-Nazi does not in any way disprove that person&#39;s statement. It might be helpful to know whether someone is of a particular religion or holds a particular ideology, in case this has in some way biased the research, but refuting claims must be done directly, not indirectly. If Holocaust deniers, for example, are neo-Nazis or anti-Semites, this would certainly guide their choice of which historical events to emphasize or ignore. But if they are making the claim, for example, that Hitler did not have a master plan for the extermination of European Jewry, the response &quot;Oh, he is saying that because he is a neo-Nazi&quot; does not refute the argument.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p>It worries me greatly that some are not concerned about bought and paid for government and media being the sole deciders of what is &#39;true&#39;.</p>

<hr/>

<p>What exactly is the point of bringing it up, if not to sway peoples opinions and discredit the facts being presented?</p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>You don&#39;t think this is plausible? The physical condition of the man and his location are irrelevant. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Really? I doubt that a man that was <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010212010328/http://www.cbsnews.com/now/story/0,1597,172666-412,00.shtml">reportedly dying in 2000</a> was capable of leading such a large &#39;organization&#39; as Al Qaeda. Though even if he was, the article affirms western intelligence knew his every movement, so how did he get away with it? Perhaps it came down to his deputy, Ayman Al-Zawahiri? Strange then, than former FBI whistleblower and translator Sibel Edmunds asserts western intelligence were working with Ayman since 1997 under Operation Gladio B. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sibel_Edmonds">According to Edmonds, Gladio B identified, among other things, regular meetings between senior US intelligence and current leader of Al Qaeda Ayman al-Zawahiri at the U.S. embassy in Baku, Azerbaijan between 1997 and 2001, with al-Zawahiri and other mujahideen being transported by NATO aircraft to Central Asia and the Balkans to participate in Pentagon-backed destabilisation operations.</a> If you havn&#39;t looked into her revelations already, I encourage you to to so as despite being gagged, she has released significant amounts of information linking western intelligence and &#39;terrorist&#39; organisations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sophisticated? You call box cutters sophisticated? You call a hijacking sophisticated? Flying a plane into a building is sophisticated? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Flying a plane into the Pentagon, the most important military installation owned by the most sophisticated military superpower the world has ever seen, is not something you can just jump in a plane and do. There is testimony from transport secretary Mineta that they were well aware America was under attack. They were well aware a hijacked aircraft was heading toward the pentagon and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDfdOwt2v3Y">Dick Cheney specifically ordered that the &#39;orders still stand&#39;.</a> Considering the aircraft was not intercepted, presumably the orders were to not intercept.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Standard operating procedure is was to cooperate with the hijackers. Taking over a plane was relatively easy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unlikely passengers/pilots would not take back control when they looked out the window/heard that hijacked aircraft were being crashed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Interceptors are set up to deal with invading aircraft, not off-course commercial airlines. I think it&#39;s quite reasonable that they were slow to respond.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They were well within capability to respond had they not been sent in the opposite direction, over the ocean. Shown with radar proof <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1GCeuSr3Mk#t=16">15 minutes into the video you dont want to watch.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unlike the devote Christians who molest children, cheat on their wives, have gay lovers, steal from their congregations, sell miracle cures, and think nothing of killing in the name of Jesus. Yes, go on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These Christians clearly do not believe in their deity&#39;s rules to the point that they are willing to kill themselves to achieve paradise - paradise which is only granted to you if you follow the rules. Were these guys extreme religious fanatics or not? They were blatantly breaking all the rules of their religion, so clearly not. What is the motivation then, to commit suicide if you know you&#39;re not going to &#39;paradise&#39;?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ease up on the throttle, slow steady turn, point the bird in the direction you want to go and ... Bob&#39;s your uncle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Really. As a Commercial Pilot myself, I&#39;m telling you its not quite that simple. The twin towers, at an extreme stretch of luck, maybe. The pentagon maneuver? Absolutely not. Im saying that as someone who breezed through training and always had a good natural ability as a pilot. <a href="http://www.911review.org/Wiki/Hanjour,Hani.shtml">Hani Hanjour was described by instructors as a completely useless pilot, unable to control a Cessna.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>While in Pennsylvania ... oh, wait, that doesn&#39;t fit your narrative does it? &quot;Ignore the facts that don&#39;t support my arguments!&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How so?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Look, the alternative is that a huge bureaucratic government, rife with corruption, veritably incompetent, lead by a boob, could coordinate the most sophisticated black flag operation in the history of the world, without a single hitch, without a single piece of evidence finding its way into the light, without a single person slipping up, without a single person spilling the beans, without a single person realizing this is a horrible idea and going to the press and be recognized as a national hero, without a single deathbed confession in over a decade? You think this is more plausible?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely. It didnt take many people inside the US Government/Intelligence, and all undoubtedly benefited very very handsomely. Why tell us? To billionaire elites, we are just parasites. Would you give up your lavish lifestyle and put you and your families lives in danger in order to be looked at as a hero by homeless people? Unlikely.</p>

<p>Dont forget that there are in fact whistleblowers testifying to US co-operation with terrorist organizations, such as Sibel Edmunds. Though perhaps since such whistleblowers never appear on BBC, skeptics seem to completely disregard what they have to say.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t subscribe here, but I think I can comment on this situation. You&#39;ve been a redditor for ten days. When you don&#39;t post a lot in a single subreddit, and accumulate the necessary karma, it usually delays your posts. You should always read the rules of a subreddit before posting. Message the mod team. Directly from the rules for <a href="/r/skeptic">/r/skeptic</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Very young accounts with a positive karma score are automatically reported for moderator review. If a young account has sufficient negative karma, that account will have it&#39;s submissions (not it&#39;s comments) automatically removed and reported for moderator review. The exact values for account age and karma threshold is not public, this is to help prevent folks from &#39;cooking&#39; accounts by creating them and feeding them some karma so they can subsequently spam the subreddit. Suffice to say that most legitimate new accounts should never notice this moderation happening, and if you do, you can always send us a modmail and we&#39;ll help figure out what&#39;s happening. </p>

<p>So for whatever reason, your account is under review it seems. Again, message the mods, and good luck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Testimony from FBI whistleblower is not evidence?</p>

<p>We have the same evidence, only you do not believe its possible that the government was involved so you do not consider that angle.</p>

<p>I, and thousands of engineers, say &#39;hmm, 2.25 seconds off freefall at WTC7, thats strange. This shouldnt happen when a skyscraper collapses. Not that we have past similar examples to go on, because a skyscraper has never collapsed due to fire in history.&#39; You look at that and say &#39;Nope, freefall is normal. Collapse is normal, because NIST said so&#39;.</p>

<p>I and dozens ex interceptor pilots say &#39;hmm, strange that these aircraft were flying around in a similar area for over an hour and not one got close to being intercepted. Last time an aircraft that wasn&#39;t communicating was heading toward the pentagon it was intercepted within minutes.&#39; You say &#39;Na, thats normal. There was confusion&#39;.</p>

<p>I could go on and on. We have the same evidence, but interpret it differently. As someone who spends hundreds of hours researching government atrocities and cover up, I know what they are capable of. You will not accept it.</p>

<p>I suspect in a parallel universe where the official story is that Dick Cheney and Co ensured the attack could happen and all profited very handsomely, you would look at the exact same evidence and go &#39;<em>of course</em> Cheney was involved. <em>Of course</em> Silverstein and all the rest had their hand in it, look how much profit these guys made! Look who was saved from prison due to the destruction of SEC documents into their investigation! Look at the war they got from it! Look at the totalitarian measures they got to inflict on us as a result! Its so obvious!&#39;</p>

<p>In such a world, if a &#39;conspiracy theorist&#39; came along and told you that actually, it was carried out by some bums who lived in a cave in the mountains of Afghanistan, you would look at them like they were insane.</p>

<p>These 19 hijackers, devout religious fundamentalists who liked to drink alcohol, snort cocaine, and live with pink-haired strippers, managed to knock down 3 buildings with 2 planes in New York, while in Washington a pilot who couldn’t handle a single engine Cessna was able to fly a 757 in an 8,000 foot descending 270 degree corskscrew turn to come exactly level with the ground, hitting the Pentagon in the budget analyst office where DoD staffers were working on the mystery of the 2.3 trillion dollars that Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld had announced “missing” from the Pentagon’s coffers in a press conference the day before, on September 10, 2001.</p>

<p>It would take me far too many hours to address just the mistakes that you make in this paragraph alone. Especially when I&#39;ve done it so many times before and people still won&#39;t accept it.</p>

<p>So I won&#39;t. I will however share the more personally enriching fact that tonight I discovered that pesto on a pizza is incredibly delicious. I don&#39;t know if this is common knowledge in your part of the world, but I will certainly be trying it more in the future.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What?</p>

<p>Sibel Edmunds is an ex FBI whistleblower, who has provided hundreds of hours of testimony concerning US intelligence working with &#39;terrorist&#39; groups and their leaders, including Osama Bin Laden and Ayman Al-Zawahiri right up until September 2001 and beyond. This is part of an Op called &#39;Operation Gladio B&#39; which is still ongoing to this day.</p>

<p>Of course, all evidence provided from Ms Edmunds was completely excluded from the 9/11 commission report.</p>

<p>&quot;Bin Laden’s group is planning a massive terrorist attack in the United States. The order has been issued. They are targeting major cities, big metropolitan cities; they think four or five cities; New York City, Chicago, Washington DC, and San Francisco; possibly Los Angeles or Las Vegas. They will use airplanes to carry out the attacks. They said that some of the individuals involved in carrying this out are already in the United States. They are here in the U.S.; living among us, and I believe some in US government already know about all of this.&quot;</p>

<p>It was believed the agents reported this information internally at the FBI but it is unclear that it ever went beyond that, <strong>in fact, both the agents remarked, and the translator told Edmonds, that the intelligence was not specific enough to take action upon.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats from another translator, but proves my point again.</p>

<p>No matter what false intelligence there is trying to implicate Bin Laden, <em>US Intelligence was working with Bin Laden</em>. The quote above that you are trying to use to disprove me, even says <em>some in the US government already know about all of this</em>.</p>

<p><em>Even in the unlikely event that it was Bin Laden, US Intelligence were helping him do it</em>.</p>

<p>Well, yes. She did, after all. But her information <em>was</em> vague. There&#39;s nothing to suggest that anyone else&#39;s information had any more substance to it.</p>

<p>Would this information have been sufficient to stop the 9/11 attacks, even though the US likely receives thousands of credible threats from around the world every year?</p>
