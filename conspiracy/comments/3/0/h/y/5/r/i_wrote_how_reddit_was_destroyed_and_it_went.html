<blockquote>
<p>It looks like you got caught up in a vote brigade, but upon further investigation it looks like you were not part of it. Thanks for writing in so promptly. I&#39;ve unbanned your account.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not quite sure what &quot;vote brigade&quot; I would have been a part of. At least they answered. I am not going to dive into a whole new rant, but I will say that the whole banning situation still seems super sketchy to me.</p>

<p>And the cowards don&#39;t even send you a message to tell you. I only found out by accident and due to my suspicious nature regarding this website.</p>

<p>....................</p>

<p>And to further prove that I am that original user, I updated the main post:</p>

<p>What can we do to push this viral on the Internet at large? Anybody have contacts with other (presumably independent) media outlets? It&#39;s a good story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, its freaking insane really. In over 6-7 years on the website, I have never been shadowbanned. And I have been going against the grain like it is my job for at least the last 2.5 years.</p>

<p>I have even made two other &quot;How Reddit Was Destroyed&quot; posts.</p>

<p>My conclusion is that the admins have gotten quicker. Or maybe I was reported by someone. </p>

<p>This is definitely very brazen. Good thing I don&#39;t give a fuck and will now scream about this to the ends of the Earth. So they rolled the dice and lost. I will not be intimidated by this shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My first case of censorship was in <a href="/r/games">/r/games</a>, when that girl wanted to become the official <a href="/r/games">/r/games</a> interviewer. I linked to one of her youtube videos, which was her and her friends being &quot;funny&quot;. It was pure cringe. I posted the video, because I thought everyone should know the type of person who would be representing <a href="/r/games">/r/games</a>. I didn&#39;t get banned from the sub. I didn&#39;t get shadow banned. I got <strong>IP banned</strong>. I didn&#39;t even know that was a thing!</p>

<p>Basically what happened was that every time I tried to log in, it said my password was wrong. If I made a new account, it would automatically do the same thing. Once I changed my IP, the problem was solved, unless I tried to log into any account that was made under the old IP. If I did, the problem returned, and any new account from the new IP, was now linked to the old IP, and would be automatically banned. </p>

<p>All this because I linked her youtube page, and made the comment that &quot;I do not want this person representing <a href="/r/games">/r/games</a>&quot;. Wowza!</p>

<p>Edit: I just want to point out that I don&#39;t think the girl had anything to do with it. I mean, I can give her the benefit of the doubt. I have no problem calling out the mods, though.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm, it was a while back. Basically, during one E3, this girl (forget her name, she&#39;s somewhat known, I believe her dad invented the lightsabre) did interviews at E3 (I beleive) for <a href="/r/games">/r/games</a>. Later on she started a thread where she put forth the proposition that she become the official interviewer for <a href="/r/games">/r/games</a>. Basically representing <a href="/r/games">/r/games</a>. The &quot;cringe&quot; video(s), which were of her and her friends desperately trying to be funny in front of a camera for hours on end, were posted on her youtube page, the same one where she would post the <a href="/r/game">/r/game</a> interviews. It should be pretty easy to track down her page on reddit, but I&#39;m on a phone, and I can&#39;t really properly search for it right now.</p>

Most uni&#39;s and businesses now use the same IP for everyone in that building or institution sometimes whole ISP&#39;s users might appear as a single user.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah the difference here is that you didn&#39;t post your likeness and full name in your post.</p>

<p>Doxxing is providing personal information that wouldn&#39;t otherwise be available.  Obviously if I posted your Facebook page, it would be doxxing, since people now have access to your name, which they didn&#39;t have before.</p>

<p>If you post your fucking full name and videos of yourself, and someone finds your dumbass Youtube page, it&#39;s not doxxing.  People who want to be public figures generally consider this free promotion...</p>

<p>They&#39;re so obviously far from the same thing that I can&#39;t help but feel you&#39;re intentionally being dishonest with your argument.  Nobody could realistically both type coherent english, and think those two situations are anywhere close to equivalent.</p>

<p>Unless the person provided the Youtube channel link, you wouldn&#39;t be allowed to post it. It would be doxing, and you would get banned. Feel free to message the admins and ask. It&#39;s not my problem if you don&#39;t understand the Reddit rules.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes just random hate-mail like &quot;Go Kill Yourself&quot; etc...</p>

<p>I got a string of one-sentence threats like &quot;Stop what you are doing.&quot; Or &quot;I can&#39;t be held responsible for what happens next&quot;, stuff that I honestly just assumed were conspiratards trolling me, but then I noticed at least 5 different accounts that went to usernames with long histories (3+ years) but no comments or submissions.</p>

<p>And then I got some just plain weird ones, like real psycho shit. Stuff I cannot even remember because of how weird it was. Once again, could just be harmless trolls.</p>

<p>Then someone made an account called &quot;Says.hi.to.(my username)&quot; and they followed me around for about 2 months just saying &quot;hi&quot; after every post. At first I laughed it off but then it just started creeping me out, like it was a subtle &quot;you are on our list now and we will watch everything you do&quot;.</p>

<p>It is a good thing that I was already on alternate accounts by that point. One of the main reasons I originally deleted my main 5+ year account. Because I realized that people could dig around in my history and make a pretty good guess about where I worked, they could have reverse image searched submission I made with my personal art, and been directed to my facebook etc...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t forget death threats. If anyone has actual numbers for how many death threats are actually followed up on I&#39;d love to see it. Seems like in most cases it&#39;s just a way for people who should be dealing with some blame and accountability to go into hiding. Not very many of these threats have been actually verified. </p>

<p>Lots of people have threatened to kill me on the internet. </p>

<p>My usual response? </p>

<p>&#39;Uhh ooook..&#39; and I move on. </p>

<p>People lie and make false claims on the internet. It&#39;s what the internet is best known for. This shouldn&#39;t excuse the inexcusable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I get home from work I&#39;ll post a perfect example of this. I pissed of the wrong people I guess. Got -570 downvotes on a single comment. I made it clear I didn&#39;t care, and in no uncertain terms asked for more downvotes. Quite by accident I discovered a few days later my entire comment history was clearly nuked. Things I said weeks ago that had been at positive votes were suddenly at crazy downvote levels. I still don&#39;t care, so they wasted their time. It was just funny actually.</p>

<p>EDIT: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/punchablefaces/comments/2xxiad/these_two/cp4nlzz?context=3">Here</a> is the initial comment I made. It&#39;s currently at over -600 something downvotes. As you will see, after I first noticed it was getting downvoted (at about -5) I made an intentionally dickish comment. I expected the downvotes to go to about -20ish...whatev...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/we_kill_creativity/?count=300&amp;amp;after=t1_cp5f60i">Here</a> is where you can see the before and after of my comment history. That comment starts about halfway down. Everything after that is horribly downvoted. Like I said, I have very little pride tide up into my reddit comment history, but it&#39;s interesting to see how it happens. </p>

<p>EDIT 2: Hmmm...When I first noticed the downvoting I stopped looking after going back a couple pages in my history. I guess it stops shortly after that, but if you take a look you can clearly see what I described.</p>

<p>This is my new username. My previous had been here four years. Just a month or so ago I was called a government spook by some guy in an unrelated sub and I was shadow banned within hours. The atmosphere is near paranoia.</p>

<p>I feel like everyone needs to calm the hell down.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just discussion.</p>

<p>Discussion, in itself, does not hurt anyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is terrifying actually. Reddit was (what I thought) once a great place for free discussion and sharing of thought.</p>

<p>Now it is repetitive memes, celebrity endorsement and unbalanced voting. There is even an approximation that it is worth $240 million from the increased popularity.</p>

<p>Many people have died for far less than that. There is an agenda at play now and anyone that stands in its way has to face the almighty shadowban </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The same could be said for the Internet at large. I feel like we have a limited window of opportunity to get the word out that the public is being manipulated on a <em>massive</em> scale. AI is starting to take hold, and when it gets good we are screwed. </p>

<p>Make no mistake, this is an occupation of a hostile force. For a look at how this is playing out in the Ukraine/Russia conflict, and how it truly is a matter of life and death, check out this excellent discussion:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Idk, I&#39;ve always felt like usually this kind of thing is more than likely due to some personal issue between OP and mods. A lot of them do seem to feel pretty self important but ultimately I&#39;m not sure anything that happens on this site should really matter to anyone but those personally involved. If it is being manipulated then so what? I&#39;ve always seen that there&#39;s general fuckery afoot in our gov&#39;t and media but I just don&#39;t think the &quot;rabbit hole&quot; is is very deep In most cases. Is it just that I don&#39;t apply the term conspiracy as widely as many people here may do or what? What am I missing? Isn&#39;t just being aware that the governments national interest seems to be to create a global empire and the majority of media is entirely subjective and toeing some party line? I don&#39;t see any sweeping change in awareness, consciousness or even caring happening in society besides as things stand nothing short of a massive violent revolt would probably change anything anyway right? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>to OP and those not following up on things hes linking:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>take away <a href="/r/reddit.com">/r/reddit.com</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>You canj bring up any issues with Reddit on a ton of different subs, theres even subs with only admins as mods where they see messages from users. Also.. we&#39;ve seen many issues about reddit brought up through <a href="/r/videos">/r/videos</a>, <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a>, <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>, etc etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>powergrab to become moderators of these subreddits</p>
</blockquote>

<p>uh.. yeah. Are you surprised on how that worked out?corrupt mods/shitty mods have been pointed out numerous times in teh past. And some subs were removed from default due to major issues.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>default subs controlled, drastic changes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>hate to burst your bubble but <a href="/r/IAMA">/r/IAMA</a> always required approval. All approval requries is for you to prove you&#39;re who you are. And the rules of IAMA have pretty much always been there. Maybe stop browsing <a href="/r/ALL">/r/ALL</a> and start browsing <a href="/r/IAMA">/r/IAMA</a> and you&#39;ll see the non celeb posts. Who the hell can help it if people upvote posts of big celebrities/whatever? That&#39;s pretty much a given.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>appearance of shills</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah.. they&#39;ve always been around. The more popular reddit gets the more you&#39;ll see it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>blatant censorship on <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a>, <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> etc.. saying x site is not allowed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>yeah people did vote on those things. And they don&#39;t allow sites notorious for making shit up on top of sites that users voted to not haveo n there anymore or people constantly reported for being shit sources.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>changed voting</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No argument here. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s something that destroys reddit though. But it definitely turns it into more of a hivemind.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>shuffle front page subs</p>
</blockquote>

<p>yeah.. theyve switched front page subs around pretty often. Why is that a problem? <a href="/r/circlejerk">/r/circlejerk</a> isn&#39;t exactly something you need to see on &#39;the front page of the internet&#39;, people newly visiting the site wouldn&#39;t understand anything in <a href="/r/circlejerk">/r/circlejerk</a>. default subs have a reason for existing, most people who use reddit OFTEN/are experienced either have their own list of subs they use or they use <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>. Default subs are like an intro to the site. It&#39;s not a controversy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you are posting too much please wait</p>
</blockquote>

<p>not sure what your point is with this. You can post as much as you want.. but certain subreddits have limitations to how often you can post unless you have x amound of karma within that sub. There&#39;s no controversy there.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>your votes do not matter</p>
</blockquote>

<p>funny how this post is near the top of <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>, and multiple times videos submissions/other submissions about corruption of reddit admins/ceo/etc have been on front page as well. Front page is decided on how popular x thing is at x time. Default subs will have a push because they are default subs.. people who just start using the site will see that stuff first. It&#39;s Always been like that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>online guerrilla tactics</p>
</blockquote>

<p>yeah.. voat.co is still there and it got hugged to death with its &#39;became popular overnight&#39;. Maybe reddit DDoSed it, or maybe a bunch of idiots did, or maybe a ton of people visited the site in a short amount of time. All you did was link to voat.co and to an article thats completely unrelated. Did the guy who runs VOAT.CO some out and say anything official about it? k</p>

<blockquote>
<p>wasn&#39;t always like this</p>
</blockquote>

<p>yes it was. Reddit destroys itself by design. The more people that come into it and the more popular it gets the more you will dislike it and it will slowly wither itself away from what you liked about it at first. Remember, over half the users will be nearing mental retardation in IQ - since it&#39;s one of the most popular sites in the world right now it reaches the General Audience. The people that watch all the shitty TV shows that have no substance, the people that read magazines and not books, the people that browse Buzzfeed 24/7. </p>

<p>Welcome to life?</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you have some points in there that mean something, but it is taken way out of proportion.</p>

<p>Also, when I click your profile that was banned/doesn&#39;t exist - the user is still there with recent submissions. Also, Voat.co is up and getting more traffic than it did before the blow up.. it&#39;s not like it will become the #1 thing ever overnight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure if you&#39;re going for sarcastic or funny, but you&#39;re not doing well at either. A proxy might do in a pinch, but many forums and sites that allow comments go out of their way to block proxy traffic, and with good reason. Proxies, transparent or anonymous are used by so many human and automated spammers that it&#39;s just easier to block them where possible. Very few ISPs these days force the use of a proxy, so the chances of blocking legitimate traffic are low.</p>

<p>Proxies won&#39;t provide any of the other benefits to privacy that VPNs do. Evading forum bans is the most trivial of VPN uses. VPNs are not slow for web content, either.</p>

<p>Neither. Just the facts Ma&#39;am. </p>

<p>For the above mentioned purpose, getting around bans, a proxy is every bit as good, and comes a less resource penalty than a vpn. You don&#39;t even need to bother installing special software to use them.</p>

<p>I never said vpns aren&#39;t &#39;good&#39;, just given the situation, not as good, for the same reasons tor is not as good as a vpn.</p>

<p>No doubt though, the merits of a vpn are much over rated, and flat out false. </p>

<p>I doubt very much that the powers that be are unable to see what you are doing just because you&#39;ve installed some software that you did not write, likely could not write, have no idea how it works, and depends on some strangers website/server for &#39;security&#39;. </p>

<p>The truth is, the only way you will ever be secure it to design and manufacture all the components for a computer yourself, assemble them, write all of the code that will execute on the computer your self, and connect only to a network that you have complete control of.</p>

<p>The internet was designed from the ground up to share information.</p>

<p>Read that again.</p>

<p>The popular thing lately is mobile verification (mostly found on asian websites). Banning phone numbers is a lot more practical because it&#39;s more difficult for a person to obtain a new phone number than it is for them to obtain a new IP, also only 1 user can register using the same phone number.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I&#39;m gonna jump on here because you don&#39;t have many replies so I might get visibility. </p>

<hr/>

<p>OP claims &quot;the cowards didn&#39;t even tell me they banned me&quot;. That is 100% the entire point of being shadowbanned. It was designed for spammers and other people like trolls, CP peddlers, vote cheaters etcetera. The idea is that they don&#39;t know they are banned, so they won&#39;t create a new account and do more rule breaking shit. Of course the admins will not tell you. Then there&#39;s his post from the other day:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1) The first thing they did was take away r/reddit.com.</p>

<p>If you had any concerns about the website as a whole, you could address them through r/reddit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You still can. Seriously. Go to <a href="/r/reddit.com">/r/reddit.com</a> and you&#39;ll see. The only thing you can&#39;t do is post there. If you message the mods, you are contacting the admins. That is literally how you speak to them. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>2) The power now resided in individual subreddits, obviously the most popular ones. There was a power grab to become moderators of these subreddits.</p>

<p>I remember as the upcoming election loomed, all of a sudden, r/circlejerk (one of the old default subreddits) became completely obsessed with bashing Ron Paul. I am not even a RP supporter, but that was definitely orchestrated, and NOT by some kids trying to be funny. Also, it coincided perfectly with this highly suspicious campaign to filter him out of the election.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can do it too! Ever noticed that button on the side of the frontpage that says &quot;create your own subreddit&quot;? It&#39;s really that easy. As for &#39;power mods&#39;, those who have control over a large number of subs, ask yourself: you need mods for your subreddit that has millions of subscribers. Who do you recruit, the guy who&#39;s been on reddit for 6 months with no mod experience, or the 4 year power user with experience modding defaults? Gee, I wonder. There&#39;s no secret cabal, it&#39;s just getting the best man for the job. </p>

<p>And with <a href="/r/circlejerk">/r/circlejerk</a> going apeshit over Ron Paul, blame the users. They&#39;re the ones who post the shit. Look to 4chan, as most of the childish shit on here comes from there. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>3) Once the default subreddits were controlled, drastic changes began to occur.</p>

<p>I remember when r/IAma was open to anyone and the popularity was decided by voting. Now it is nothing more than a cheap place for celebrities to whore out their products and you need to be &quot;approved&quot;. Someone named Victoria is involved and how does that makes any sense whatsoever? Celebrities have entire teams of branding/PR/social media teams that work for them. Why do they need to be at reddit HQ and/or required to have a reddit rep? Because these AMA&#39;s are extremely organized and sponsored with money.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/30ea3g/mod_post_riama_misconceptions/">This post should explain it thoroughly</a>. And as for requiring approval, do you still wanna see &quot;I&#39;m an astronaut trust me guys&quot; or do you wanna see <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18pik4/i_am_astronaut_chris_hadfield_currently_orbiting/">I&#39;m in fucking space right now</a>. There are no ifs, buts or maybes, it is a <strong>fact</strong> that <a href="/r/iama">/r/iama</a> was made better when it was changed. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are plenty of subreddits that are now covertly controlled. Check out this post which was pushed into r/undelete for identifying a list of keywords banned from r/technology.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe because mods do far too much to announce every single thing we do. And why the hell would we announce it anyway? If we automate rule enforcement and tell people how, they will just find a way to work around it. &quot;Oh, but Streisand effect, the users will find out, you can&#39;t hide it forever&quot;. Trust me when I tell you, for every secret mod action you find out about, there are a shit ton more that you don&#39;t. And they&#39;re not evil. Most of them are word/phrase removal, like f***** or n*****. A lot of subs auto remove those, because who wants to see that shit?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>4) The appearance of shills soon became VERY apparent.</p>

<p>All of a sudden new accounts started popping up out of nowhere. Cue the birth of r/HailCorporate. &quot;Feel good&quot; military posts started appearing, like a soldier coming home to his dog. New users entered AMA&#39;s to lob softball questions &quot;Mr Burns, your campaign has the momentum of a runaway freight train, how does it feel to be so popular?&quot; From brand new accounts that never posted again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe because it takes less than 30 seconds to create an account. And the AMA thing has been debunked so many fucking times it&#39;s insane. Celebrity Bob is doing an AMA. Bob posts on twitter to let his fans know. Bob&#39;s fans come to reddit, create an account to ask their idol a question, then are never seen again because reddit is not a site they use. It doesn&#39;t take a brain surgeon to use that kind of logic. As for shills, are there any? Has there ever been? Probably. Reddit gets over 150 <em>million</em> unique visitors every month. What company wouldn&#39;t try to exploit that? In those cases, they receive the aforementioned shadowban, that you all think is so nasty. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>5) Now we have blatant censorship on r/news, r/worldnews etc... saying that X site is not allowed.</p>

<p>What ever happened to letting people vote on the content of this website? Trash tabloids constantly go viral on political subreddits due to sensationalized headlines and the fact that most Americans are unaware of different overseas publications.</p>

<p>Not to mention the fact that default subreddit rules are now completely refined, sophisticated and purposely worded to allow maximum mod-interpretation. Honestly, someone with a law degree with a proud.
Major politically-charged subreddits now insist on exact titles or quotes because that stops users from being able to post the important point summary of the article as the title . Using only official titles from only approved media has turned reddit into mainstream media.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whatever happened to voting? <a href="/r/atheism">/r/atheism</a> happened. That sub was a testament to what happens when the users are allowed to decide content.<br/>
And the reason the titles are required  to be the same as the article is to stop sensationalist and false titles being posted, because most redditors won&#39;t read the article, only the thread title. If it&#39;s wrong, they don&#39;t get the correct info, do they?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>6) Speaking of voting, they changed that too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seriously? This is supposed to lend credence to your conspiracy theory? Jesus Christ, boo fucking hoo. Get over it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>7) Hey guise, us nerds who run reddit have decided to shuffle all of the front-page subreddits, tee-hee we are so random ‿^</p>

<p>No more r/circlejerk, that pesky subreddit hits too close to home. Lets add 2X to the mix, (even though they wanted to remain an anonymous sub), fuck them, we need to show our shareholders we represent the female demographic. Lets also add a bunch of subs that we can use to share propaganda like r/nottheonion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="/r/circlejerk">/r/circlejerk</a> is still quite visible, hitting frontpage very often. And that subreddit gets special privileges from the admins, so they don&#39;t have a vendetta against it. 2X didn&#39;t wanna be a default? Then why not <a href="http://i.imgur.com/25vsKAV.jpg">uncheck the box in subreddit settings</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>8) You are posting too much, please wait...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is to stop spammers. Seriously. Think for a minute, Jesus. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or you can always just have your comments deleted. You will not even know your comment is deleted. You will still see it. Only you. The only way to know is to be inherently suspicious, and sign out of your account after clicking on the permalink of the comment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Same reason as SBans. If you don&#39;t know it&#39;s been removed, you won&#39;t post it again. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>9) Reddit is not a meritocracy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Really? <em>Really</em>? Posts that are higher get voted more? No, it can&#39;t be true! It&#39;s not that they have more visibility, and so are voted more by people who don&#39;t go too deep or anything</p>

<blockquote>
<p>10) The arrival and subsequent take over of r/undelete.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Try reading that guy&#39;s post. It&#39;s hilarious how fucking stupid he is. &quot;People can make requests for my sub, whatever will I do to get it back?&quot; I dunno, maybe request it yourself you fucking spanner. There&#39;s also the fact that mods cannot shadowban. Only admins can. So he&#39;s pissed them off somehow. Most likely from posting things that get removed. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>11) Now we are seeing a new site-wide trend that is designed to make it even harder to call out shills.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most likely because an accusation like that would get those problem doxxed. Everyone knows how reddit loves to play Batman (Boston bombing anyone?). Make them think someone might be a shill and they&#39;ll <em>have</em> to go detective mode. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>12) All of the proper &quot;checks and balances&quot; are now in place.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OP is quite literally arguing that reddit&#39;s part in the Boston bombing debacle that I just mentioned was a good thing. You want to take advice from someone this fucking stupid?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>13) Online guerrilla tactics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I said before, 150 million visitors a month. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if some of them did it. Or one. There was a while ago when reddit was DDoSed by one guy so bad that the site was screwed for days</p>

<hr/>

<p>I thought the entire point behind a conspiracy theory is having insider info that others aren&#39;t aware of? OP doesn&#39;t have inside knowledge, he has a lack of it. Pretty much everything I refuted I was able to in less than 5 seconds by thinking about it. OP is a moron. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This happened to <a href="/r/knives">/r/knives</a>.  Someone posted a knife and the mods banned it for some reason. Then the entire reddit community caught wind of it and posted the same knife picture and flooded <a href="/r/knives">/r/knives</a> with that same pic.  The mods were scrambling trying to delete them all.  They finally gave up and said &quot;we get it&quot;... they also made the sub private for a while.  Not sure if they ever apologized.  But the Streisand was in full effect that day.</p>

<p>Why would you want to stay here and &quot;fight?&quot; When that just gives them more power. Every page view, every visitor, every comment is money to these people. Reddit is too far gone to be what it once was. The only way to change reddit is to leave. If you leave this website, and every one else does, it&#39;s useless. What&#39;s a website with no visitors? </p>

<p>People take this website way too seriously. It&#39;s a website. It&#39;s not a country, it&#39;s not a government. It&#39;s something that could be gone tomorrow if the users decided they no longer like it. This is just a window to the Internet to me, it is not a fighting ground. It means nothing because there will be hundreds more after which will do the same. Think about digg and MySpace or xanga or.... </p>

<p>Stop putting so much into this website. It&#39;s just a page of the internet. You give them more power by thinking it&#39;s more than it is. &quot;Fighting&quot; gives them what they want! Page views and visitors is all reddit cares about because that is money. </p>

<p>I find it odd that people complain about reddit here on their website and are surprised by bans and what not. It&#39;s a website. They can do whatever they want. It&#39;s not a democracy. Open yours eyes and see what this is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree with this. They fight us because they want to drown out the information. So, us leaving, is the ultimate victory.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right that this is just a website. But it&#39;s the biggest community/news aggregator, we shouldn&#39;t let anyone bully us away and then assume that everyone will follow. It&#39;s far more likely that only a small portion will leave and the majority will stay and be more susceptible to all the bullshit in the process.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t feed the trolls, simple as that, just pile on the links, evidence, information. In a sense, do as politicians do, don&#39;t answer questions, but say what <em>you</em> want the discussion to be about.</p>

<p>Remember that these shills don&#39;t believe the official story, they just don&#39;t care either way.. Treat them like the bots that they are and just focus on all the good people that are still out here, there&#39;s plenty of people with an open mind who are happy to start a normal discussion.</p>

How much of a community is there if more than half are bots &amp; paid accounts (marketers, shills, corporate interests, &quot;celebrity&quot; accounts, politicians, the list goes on, etc).

When a front page reddit sub posts about pesticides causing cancer from a respectable scientific study they care.

    <div class="md"><p>We need an alternative that can&#39;t be easily compromised. That&#39;s the tough part. Maybe something distributed, where nobody could gain too much power. One problem with that would be spam, it would be a magnet for spam. Still, a distributed model would have some advantages, such as not being beholden to any individual owner or host. It could also limit the damage that a bad actor could do. Such a system would allow for anyone to easily clone an existing &quot;sub&quot;, which would mean no more than a name change while preserving content. It would be simple to allow anyone to back up data of interest, and republish as necessary.</p>

<p>Obviously, I&#39;m just spitballing here, but I think we need a different <em>kind</em> of system than reddit. It&#39;s a failed model due to its vulnerability to corruption.</p>

<p>Reddit is open source.</p>

<p>Take the code, disable the vote fuzzing and other things that lie about data, and host it. Possibly on TOR so you would be free to not delete <em>anything</em>. But subreddits still need a way to stop their content from going to shit. Possibly have every single post show up in <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> and the subreddit it was posted to, and if it&#39;s deleted it just shows up in <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>, and maybe a <a href="/r/deleted">/r/deleted</a>.</p>

<p>One thing I would like to see is image/video/misc data hosting inbuilt into the website, instead of relying on outside content. A lot harder to take down that way, and more anonymous.

<p>Also, what do you do about illegal content? You can either host it on TOR (and only on TOR) and have hardly anyone use it, but you wouldn&#39;t be forced to take down anything, or you can host it normally but you will have to take down illegal content.</p>

<p>That is the problem, how the hell do you handle that. Which is why it makes it risky running a site like this without a team of lawyers. They could litigate you out of business, sigh....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.</p>

<p>Shadowbanning is a reddit-wide thing that&#39;s supposed to exist to stop spammers.  You still see your posts, but nobody else can.</p>

<p>Moderators can still approve posts by someone who is shadowbanned and they will show up.</p>

<p>What some moderators are doing, though, is having automoderator automatically delete posts by people they don&#39;t like.  It&#39;s even harder to detect, and is really shitty.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s pretty amusing that people are suddenly treating &quot;censorship&quot; as a bad thing.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been using this website for five years, and in that entire time the site-wide trend has been toward more and heavier moderation. And the reason is not because moderators somehow overrode the wishes of the population. Almost all of these decisions were extremely popular, and it&#39;s still quite common to see people request that various mods remove or ban even more posts than they do currently.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been against increased moderation for a long time. In my view, the voting system works perfectly fine without any interference, and people are always free to go to alternate subreddits or sites if they want to. However, this is apparently a minority opinion. It seems like most people are in favor of more censorship, as long as it only extends to posts they don&#39;t approve of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit mods get a little bit of authority and they really feel they are something. I would even argue that most of them bring up offline that they are mods on this internet forum. This is how new the role is to them. I am telling you never look upon these &quot;newbies&quot; lest you become like them - hypocrites.</p>

<p>They have no idea that they are blocking actual information while they abuse this authority. Truthfully most mods are blind. The reason for this is because they aren&#39;t mature and are unsure how to properly moderate or facilitate with this privilege.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t blame them as a whole but blame the ones who work and conspire together, we have been shown chat logs but still continue to use this site. No different than most do with Facebook at this point. We submit our voice in turn for these cheap services. There are cops who patrol and will show up at your door for what you say on here too. It&#39;s become the same concept. The blind are truly leading the blind but no real admission of it from them. They don&#39;t know what they are or where to begin as themselves, but remain comfortable with being a hypocrite.</p>

<p>The trouble you all expect will come. Keep watch then against the world.</p>

<p>As for me I will continue to use this site less and keep safe measure against the ones who I described, yeah, I will be at ytmnd.com</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel there is a confusion among this community. </p>

<p>Reddit has become corrupt and is as that.</p>

<p>This could be because the user enjoys having a high tally of karma-points or being a member for a lengthy time. There are individuals who are mods in multiple sub-reddits, spread across this entire domain. Because of this, nothing is to change at this website. They have managed their desired traffic poorly. The persons who have made sub-reddits with specific names have only allowed specific posts.</p>

<p>What is to happen is that the reddit community will divide itself. </p>

<p>Yes, a possibility that a front page pinned post about &#39;fixing the issue&#39; with no real fix as the problem remains embedded permanently. This is as good as it is.</p>

<p>The smart will disconnect and the rest will see rejoice seeing their stories on CNN, FOX, etc</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I worked on a fairly high profile senate campaign that got lots of national attention. The office I worked out of had 10-12 interns at any given time constantly posting and manipulating votes in an insane variety of subreddits. I&#39;m pretty sure there were 5 other offices involved in this operation. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not gonna say what campaign I was on, but I will say this. I&#39;d be very surprised if the DNC didn&#39;t have some kind of deal with Reddit. You don&#39;t just get the world&#39;s most powerful person to do an AMA without any strings attached. </p>

<p>Considering the politics of people like Alexis Ohanian, I&#39;m sure it was something Reddit offered to do.</p>

<p><a href="http://hubski.com">Hubski</a> - Old school, had similar attention to voat a few years ago. Decent discussion but few members.</p>

<p><a href="https://spreadit.io">Spreadit</a> - Dark theme, doesnt seem all that different from reddit. Even the name is similar.</p>

<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a> - Lots of business and programming talk but can also find some good misc discussion.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.linkibl.com/">Linkibl</a> - No comment, seen it posted at <a href="/r/redditalternatives">/r/redditalternatives</a>. Looks like pinterest for links.</p>

<p><a href="http://voat.co">Voat</a> - Almost direct clone that cropped up just recently.</p>

<p>You should probably either link or better yet screecap a few of those &quot;rule violating&quot; posts, because as it is this is just an unsubstantiated allegation. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s false, I&#39;m saying it&#39;s unsubstantiated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, that&#39;s backwards. We know for a fact that people get banned from Reddit all the time for perfectly ordinary reasons, and that sometimes they then lose their shit and post rants about a conspiracy to suppress them. We have no actual evidence that anyone has been banned from Reddit for their opinions.</p>

<p>The sensible thing to do when a rant like this is posted is to assume that OP was banned for vote manipulation etc and just has a martyr complex about it. It&#39;s on OP to demonstrate otherwise, no sensible person would waste time researching it themselves when the answer is so obviously more likely to be &quot;yeah, they were banned for violating rules X, Y, and Z and making 10 different accounts to evade it.&quot;</p>

<p>Ehm, no, it really isn&#39;t. I&#39;m not asking AndyWarwheels to go out and read OP&#39;s comment history and post examples; I&#39;m asking him, <em>since he&#39;s already gone through it</em>, to post some examples to substantiate what he says. I&#39;m not putting an unreasonable or improper burden of proof on him, in fact I don&#39;t think he has a duty to do anything, but it&#39;s not wrong of me to ask.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been around here for more than five years and have watched the slow decline in quality and big rise in censorship. I don&#39;t see the point in banning accounts unless they explicitly break rules such as calling for upvotes, spamming, or using social media to brigade. And even then I think there should be some sort of warning given. I have run across a number of people who got shadowbanned and they honestly had no idea why. I would go check it out and see they had posted to their blog too many times compared to their other engagement, or some shit like that. </p>

<p>As a mod at <a href="/r/dreams">/r/dreams</a> I have invited members of the professional community to drop by the sub and share their knowledge, but I have to warn them about all kinds of &quot;reddiquette&quot; and have found it turns them off. &quot;You can do this but you can&#39;t do that and if you do too much of this and that your ass will get banned and your soul eaten by Satan.&quot;</p>

<p>I think Reddit is screwing itself. I mean, it&#39;ll still get all sort of traffic, which means revenue, but I think it&#39;s scaring away people with knowledge to share. If you read what founders like Aaron S. said about why they created the site, they wanted to create a community to share knowledge and information. But hey, George Clooney is doing an IAMA so fuck it.</p>

Is it shocking that the NSA or [insert government/subcontracted spying agency here] is heavily monitoring and censoring a massive and open internet site like Reddit?

<p>take away <a href="/r/reddit.com">/r/reddit.com</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>You canj bring up any issues with Reddit on a ton of different subs, theres even subs with only admins as mods where they see messages from users. Also.. we&#39;ve seen many issues about reddit brought up through <a href="/r/videos">/r/videos</a>, <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a>, <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>, etc etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>powergrab to become moderators of these subreddits</p>
</blockquote>

<p>uh.. yeah. Are you surprised on how that worked out?corrupt mods/shitty mods have been pointed out numerous times in teh past. And some subs were removed from default due to major issues.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>default subs controlled, drastic changes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>hate to burst your bubble but <a href="/r/IAMA">/r/IAMA</a> always required approval. All approval requries is for you to prove you&#39;re who you are. And the rules of IAMA have pretty much always been there. Maybe stop browsing <a href="/r/ALL">/r/ALL</a> and start browsing <a href="/r/IAMA">/r/IAMA</a> and you&#39;ll see the non celeb posts. Who the hell can help it if people upvote posts of big celebrities/whatever? That&#39;s pretty much a given.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>appearance of shills</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah.. they&#39;ve always been around. The more popular reddit gets the more you&#39;ll see it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>blatant censorship on <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a>, <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> etc.. saying x site is not allowed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>yeah people did vote on those things. And they don&#39;t allow sites notorious for making shit up on top of sites that users voted to not haveo n there anymore or people constantly reported for being shit sources.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>changed voting</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No argument here. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s something that destroys reddit though. But it definitely turns it into more of a hivemind.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>shuffle front page subs</p>
</blockquote>

<p>yeah.. theyve switched front page subs around pretty often. Why is that a problem? <a href="/r/circlejerk">/r/circlejerk</a> isn&#39;t exactly something you need to see on &#39;the front page of the internet&#39;, people newly visiting the site wouldn&#39;t understand anything in <a href="/r/circlejerk">/r/circlejerk</a>. default subs have a reason for existing, most people who use reddit OFTEN/are experienced either have their own list of subs they use or they use <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>. Default subs are like an intro to the site. It&#39;s not a controversy.</p>

<p>you are posting too much please wait</p>
</blockquote>

<p>not sure what your point is with this. You can post as much as you want.. but certain subreddits have limitations to how often you can post unless you have x amound of karma within that sub. There&#39;s no controversy there.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>your votes do not matter</p>
</blockquote>

<p>funny how this post is near the top of <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>, and multiple times videos submissions/other submissions about corruption of reddit admins/ceo/etc have been on front page as well. Front page is decided on how popular x thing is at x time. Default subs will have a push because they are default subs.. people who just start using the site will see that stuff first. It&#39;s Always been like that.</p>

<p>yeah.. voat.co is still there and it got hugged to death with its &#39;became popular overnight&#39;. Maybe reddit DDoSed it, or maybe a bunch of idiots did, or maybe a ton of people visited the site in a short amount of time. Did the guy who runs VOAT.CO some out and say anything official about it? k</p>

<blockquote>
<p>wasn&#39;t always like this</p>

<p>yes it was. Reddit destroys itself by design. The more people that come into it and the more popular it gets the more you will dislike it and it will slowly wither itself away from what you liked about it at first. Remember, over half the users will be nearing mental retardation in IQ - since it&#39;s one of the most popular sites in the world right now it reaches the General Audience. The people that watch all the shitty TV shows that have no substance, the people that read magazines and not books, the people that browse Buzzfeed 24/7. </p>

<p>Welcome to life?</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you have some points in there that mean something, but it is taken way out of proportion.</p>

<p>Also, when I click your profile that was banned/doesn&#39;t exist - the user is still there with recent submissions. Also, Voat.co is up and getting more traffic than it did before the blow up.. it&#39;s not like it will become the #1 thing ever overnight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know it&#39;s fun to hate on Reddit Admins in here, but let&#39;s get something straight.</p>

<p>Users can be banned <em>automatically</em>. Reddit Admins don&#39;t have to bring down the banhammer manually. If a user gets too many reports, the user will get shadowbanned by the system.</p>

<p>A simple, polite message to the admins can clear it up if you didn&#39;t actually break any rules.</p>

<p>My guess is that if you broke rules, your account will remain banned, but if you didn&#39;t then it will come back.</p>

<p>The reality is that lots of <em>shills</em> probably reported your post and the user was automatically banned. If approached correctly, and if no actual rules were broken, the user will come back.</p>

<p>Yep. completely dead. You sound like one of those wow players that claim every new game coming out is gonna be the &#39;wow killer&#39; and claim it&#39;s so awesome.

    <div class="md"><p>Either way, I choose to embrace my undeniable Sovereign Rights protected by Common Law and the like. Uncle Sam, and the government servants are number 2, and I am number One of The People. They can be creeps all they want, until one of my laws are broken. After all, they claim they are looking for terrorists, and that I am not. By the way, we all have these Sovereign Rights at birth, and are not required to be granted any rights as a Citizen slave. If we have excepted this, the choice has no requirements, and is interchangeable; as we may contract with; or not contract with who we choose. Our Rights to complete Freedom from damages from persons, or People never go away. No matter what propaganda you hear. Common Law rules Internationally. The new Statutes that are constantly created under The Constitution, are not laws; and do not apply or hold up under a &#39;legal&#39; document that we are told is &quot;the highest law of the land.&quot; (It isn&#39;t even signed by any one, like any legal document should.) It is a list of rights that The People already have, and a list of rights to the Servants of The People to uphold. So Live with Peace, but invoke your Rights, and your own Laws when needed, with consequences when they are violated. Never except any contract law with a reptile, unless it truly benefits you, and does not damage your freedom. &quot;The People should not fear their Government, The Government should fear their People.&quot;</p>

I say we do stand and fight. But this needs to be an organized effort. If everyone works together to flood one sub with the same previously banned post, the mods may give up there. If we divide, we cannot overwhelm them by numbers like we all could together.
I also say we create new subs as alternatives to the major ones. Same themes, but keep them as under-the-radar as possible. When they begin to become regulated, fight back. It will have a smaller, tight-knit community full of people who are really dedicated to pushing back the regulations and shadow-bans and whatnot.
An Internet divided cannot win. We need to fight, and we need to fight TOGETHER. One post at a time, let&#39;s take the first step to taking back reddit.

    <div class="md"><p>I know that this comment will go straight to the bottom, but w/e. </p>

<p>Look, guys, the Internet is public property. Websites are <em>not</em>. </p>

<p>There is no such thing as an &quot;abusive mod.&quot; If you&#39;re talking about the site owners, it&#39;s their site, and they can do whatever they want. You have no rights here, nor should you expect any. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like if you walked into someone&#39;s house, set down, and then demanded they cook you a meal. </p>

<p>Or, to make it more relevant...it&#39;s like if you go into their house and start bitching about how strict they are. </p>

<p>What do you expect their reaction will be? </p>

<p>A rational person would expect something like this, &quot;Hey, get the hell out of my house, then.&quot; </p>

<p>If you&#39;re talking mods of an individual sub...grow up. News flash: <em>You can make your own sub.</em></p>

<p>With AutoModerator, a mod can set it up so that if you get negative karma in their sub, you get shadowbanned. It can all be automated. This is the only way they can fight trolls. </p>

<p><strong>There is no conspiracy here. Don&#39;t poo all over other people&#39;s way of making money unless you want to be shown the door.  It&#39;s common sense. What&#39;s irrational is to complain about it on that same website.</strong> </p>

<p>At the time of this writing, this thread is 93% upvoted. So are you guys really such free thinkers? I see a lot of willful mob mentality here. Is it so unreasonable that Reddit would ban someone for trash talking their site <em>on</em> their site? </p>

<p>I know no one will see this, since you guys are going to scuttle this comment, but I had to say my peace. </p>

<p>Peace out!</p>

It was made a default along with <a href="/r/atheism">/r/atheism</a> to automatically gain millions of subs to fluff the numbers and recruit. Any right wing source is considered sensationalist and removed, yet left wing sources that post blatant propaganda are allowed and upvoted to the top. Notice how everything in that sub has 100-300 upvotes yet the anti-Right wing stuff always gets 2000-5000. Anything anti-Left wing is downvoted to silence. But people on reddit don&#39;t care about blatant propaganda and censorship because it helps their agenda. And people will downvote to deflect my post but really it just proves me correct everytime, much like how they ban people like OP.</p>

<p>Edit - Love the downvote brigade, as predicted. Keep proving me right.</p>

<p>100% free and open to the population of the world, and the world dictates the popular content. Then complain that the popular content doesnt support your viewpoints? </p>

<p>Let me remind you:</p>

<p>This is the same subreddit where they don&#39;t believe Sandy Hook happened, the Boston Bombing happened and they think that the govt can somehow pull of 9-11 but the Secret Service (the Presidents guard..the people with the highest security job in the world) cannot hide a South American hooker party?</p>

<p>You want to know how you can tell this subreddit is 100% horseshit? <strong>Ask the regulars which large and known conspiracy theories they initially subscribed to, that they no longer believe in, and why. You&#39;ll get silence.</strong> </p>

<p>You then bring up global warming and weather. Shit tactic. If the great debates in human history all started with each side grabbing at the low hanging extreme fruit of the opposition, I wouldn&#39;t be replying to your bits saved on a database, of a server, connected to the internet, from a computer I built, with parts from a company with global presence. </p>

<p>Both &quot;sides&quot; have good rational points. If you mind to look past the 
sensationalist titles. Stop with the &quot;my tribe and your tribe&quot; bullshit.</p>

<p>Anyone can see there is a bias on several of the subreddits on this site. </p>

<p>I give you today&#39;s example of the &quot;rhino hunter&quot;. Protesters knew, but left out the information that the hunter was hunting the rhino for actual &quot;good&quot; reasons. Someone who just read the long as hell title(and I presume the article), would have never known. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes just random hate-mail like &quot;Go Kill Yourself&quot; etc...</p>

<p>I got a string of one-sentence threats like &quot;Stop what you are doing.&quot; Or &quot;I can&#39;t be held responsible for what happens next&quot;, stuff that I honestly just assumed were conspiratards trolling me, but then I noticed at least 5 different accounts that went to usernames with long histories (3+ years) but no comments or submissions.</p>

<p>And then I got some just plain weird ones, like real psycho shit. Stuff I cannot even remember because of how weird it was. Once again, could just be harmless trolls.</p>

<p>Then someone made an account called &quot;Says.hi.to.(my username)&quot; and they followed me around for about 2 months just saying &quot;hi&quot; after every post. At first I laughed it off but then it just started creeping me out, like it was a subtle &quot;you are on our list now and we will watch everything you do&quot;.</p>

<p>It is a good thing that I was already on alternate accounts by that point. One of the main reasons I originally deleted my main 5+ year account. Because I realized that people could dig around in my history and make a pretty good guess about where I worked, they could have reverse image searched submission I made with my personal art, and been directed to my facebook etc...</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: As a matter of fact I just got a new one:</p>

<p>This will not end well for you not just for this account, but also for your personal life my friend, heed this warning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, I still think reddit&#39;s codebase is fine as it is. Also, they switched languages (maybe when it was a lot smaller) before, so switching again would give a chance to go over all the code and see what it does. But I like python, so I have no problem with it as it is.</p>

<p>One thing I would like to see is image/video/misc data hosting inbuilt into the website, instead of relying on outside content. A lot harder to take down that way, and more anonymous. Would use a <em>lot</em> of disk space thougAll they will find is that I&#39;m an anime watching, 24/7 computer gaming nerd.h, text compresses a hell of a lot better than <del>dank memes</del> images. </p>

<p>Also, what do you do about illegal content? You can either host it on TOR (and only on TOR) and have hardly anyone use it, but you wouldn&#39;t be forced to take down anything, or you can host it normally but you will have to take down illegal content.</p>

<p>Shadowbanning is a reddit-wide thing that&#39;s supposed to exist to stop spammers.  You still see your posts, but nobody else can.</p>

<p>Moderators can still approve posts by someone who is shadowbanned and they will show up.</p>

<p>What some moderators are doing, though, is having automoderator automatically delete posts by people they don&#39;t like.  It&#39;s even harder to detect, and is really shitty.</p>
