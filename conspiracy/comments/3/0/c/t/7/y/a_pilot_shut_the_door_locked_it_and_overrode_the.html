<p>people assume that things are different now than what it was in the past with the human sacrifices (like the mayans, etc). Fact is, nothings changed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly.  I could think of no scenario where Pilot 2 deliberately makes the moves to lock out pilot 1, except with foul play.  If Pilot 2 died, Pilot 1 would still be able to get back in.  So it was a deliberate lock out. </p>

<p>But imagine they follow procedure, and a flight attendant comes in to the pit while Pilot 1 goes to the potty.  Now the flight attendant disables Pilot 2, and locks the door, and moves the throttle into a downward slope until impact.</p>

<p>Seems it would take only one bad flight attendant, a low level employee, to create this scenario. </p>

<p>Yes, there would. They would need to 1) Know how to operate the cockpit door override to stop the pilot from using the emergency keypad in the cabin to reenter the cockpit and 2) Know how to disengage or reprogram the autopilot in order to put the plane into a descent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The official version is now that the copilot commited suicide and dragged 149 people with him to death.</p>

<p>There are mainly 2 things that are suspect to me (about the flight recorder):</p>

<ol>
<li>Why were there no last words from the copilot on the flight recorder? If I wanted to kill myself and drag over a hundred people with me, I would for sure tell the world why.</li>
<li>If the captain was locked out of the cockpit, why wasn&#39;t he talking to the copilot? Only &quot;knocks&quot; on the door and screaming voices from the passengers have been reported so far. If I was the captain I would have tried to convince my copilot to change his mind. Either by shouting at the door or talking via the radio equipment.</li>
</ol>

<p>Nothing like this has been reported to be found on the flight recorder. Maybe there were technical difficulties which caused the plane to crash and the airline wants to hide it to get arround the millions of compensations they would have to pay the dependants. Furthermore don&#39;t forget about their reputation. Germanwings would be ruined if a technical flaw had caused the crash.</p>

<p>Sorry for any english mistakes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would the airline try to cover up technical difficulties to not pay insurance compensation? Why would they rather go with Co-pilot suicide, which means the plane intentionally crashed rather than accidentally, which means insurance compensation would be astronomically higher than if it were by accident? Doesn&#39;t make sense Jobe. Lufthansa (owner of germanwings) would have its reputation tarnished for sure over an accident, but not ruined. What would ruin it is if one of its pilots commit a tragedy like this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t fault a whole company for the sick mind of a single employee of them. If it was in fact the copilot who killed everyone, this would mean that it could have happened to any other flight as well. Mad people can be found everywhere.</p>

<p>There are very strict rules for the maintenance of airliners. This is just an idea, but lets assume something went wrong there and either Lufthansa (Germanwings) or Airbus knowingly ignored a technical issue. It doesn&#39;t even have to be deliberately. Maybe someone just forgot to tighten some screws, whatever. So wether it was with or without their knowledge (the first case is worse of course), this would actualy be a very good reason to try to cover something up.</p>

<p>The word &quot;ruined&quot; is a bit exaggerated, I can see that. But we&#39;re still talking about millions if not billions of euros here. It&#39;s not just about the compensation they would have to pay. The value of their stocks would suffer immensely and don&#39;t forget about the missing of future earnings because people would rather decide to book from a different airline.</p>

<p>It has happened before that companies ignored mechanical problems especialy if a lot of their machines had the same flaw. Maybe there was no particular regulation for the exact part which wasn&#39;t completely safe. I can see that a company would decide to let it stay as it is rather than changing the same part of every plane they own for a ton of money. Their engineers could have evaluated the chances of something happening as minimal (it doesn&#39;t even need to be a serial flaw for that). Their bosses would then be like &quot;fuck it, we&#39;re a budget airline, let&#39;s save the money and take the off chance of something happening&quot;. An engineer wouldn&#39;t take the risk for sure, but a businessman could decide like that.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just making up ideas. Imo something along these lines could have possibly happened and it would definitely be Airbus/Lufthansas fault.</p>

<p>I mean the evidence so far does seem to point to the co-pilot. </p>

<p>It&#39;s also possible the French may be overly eager to announce that there was no mechanical failure in order to protect Airbus as company. </p>

<p>But the investigation is far from finished, there is still a significant mountain (I know... I&#39;m horrible) of evidence to go through.</p>

<p>So I do think it&#39;s important that people who want to follow the case do keep an open mind and don&#39;t jump to conclusions quite yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>FlightRadar24 reports the autoflight altitude was changed to 100ft shortly after the co-pilot locked the pilot out:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Between 09:30:52 and 09:30:55 we can see that the autopilot was manually changed from 38,000 feet to 100 feet and 9 seconds later the aircraft started to descend, probably with the &quot;open descent&quot; autopilot setting.
The reason why the selected altitude is 96ft is that least significant bit for altitude setting equals 16 ft, and we suspect that you can’t set autopilot to 0000 altitude, so the minimum would be 100ft down rounded to 96ft in binary representation in BDS40h register.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe he just took the opportunity, or perhaps he has tried in the past and the other pilot didn&#39;t get up to goto the bathroom which thwarted the plan previously? that would make some sense that it was just a random act and not targeted to anyone?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My question isn&#39;t about why the pilot went to the bathroom.  My question is about how the co-pilot was counting on him to leave.  With that flight, the pilot <em>could have</em> stayed in the cockpit the whole time, so having him leave at just that time couldn&#39;t have been part of a plan.  Most likely, this was a spontaneous &quot;well, now&#39;s a good time!&quot; kind of thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are so so many suspicious things going on here. These sorts of investigations usually take MONTHS but apparently they have it all figured out after 2 days?  Even recovering black boxes and checking them usually takes over a week. Also there were a large number of cancelled flights the day after as many pilots and crews did not want to fly. This is almost unheard of after a single plane goes down. I still think there has been a huge mechanical failure and that there is a covering up of this. I will wait for the actual investigation to be completed though, I cant believe so many people are accepting what a <em>prosecutor</em> with zero airplane knowledge is saying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know enough about world politics to think of specifics, but some people are willing to strap bombs on their bodies and sacrifice themselves for a cause.  The pilot left alone in the cockpit behind the locked door could have been on a suicide mission.  For whom and why is something to think about.</p>

<p>Edit: Some digital locks use wireless control.  This is complicated but maybe someone might take a look at this article in Popular Mechanics and have some insight: <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/home/how-to/a9729/ditch-the-keys-its-time-to-get-a-smart-lock-16200140/">http://www.popularmechanics.com/home/how-to/a9729/ditch-the-keys-its-time-to-get-a-smart-lock-16200140/</a>  The section called <em>The Difficulty With Digital Locks</em> is interesting.</p>

<p>They could have been held hostage and possibly killed, they could have been financially set for life after the matter, or they could be afraid of the backlash that would likely be targeted at them for all of this.</p>

<p>Personally, I think this crash was one part of a grander scheme by some transporation conglomerate to cut down on air travel.

Maybe because they have a new method of transportation in store, or perhaps because they want to expand upon a previously existing method.

<p>Pretty much unrelated: I&#39;d like to see airships put into play again, for short distance travel in places with high traffic. Not for safety or convenience really, more because I like to imagine a sky full of airships and how awesome that would be. I&#39;ve had dreams where I&#39;m riding up to a big city and am able to see it from tens of miles away thanks to the airships in the sky above it.</p>

<p>This is hilariously nonsensical. </p>

<p>If a transportation conglomerate wants people to stop flying this is a stupid way to do it. It would much easier to just double ticket prices, not only does this involve not killing anyone it also has the advantage of actually accomplishing their goal. </p>

<p>This of course ignores that 2011, 2012 and 2013 were some of the safest years on record.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why on Earth would you assume that airliners would want to be part of a conglomerate to bring down air traffic? That&#39;s what&#39;s nonsensical.</p>

<p>Obviously it would be made up of entities that have interests in water or ground transport. How would they be able to control ticket prices for flights?</p>

<p>Either way, raising ticket prices does nothing towards reliability. It wouldn&#39;t bring down public perception of the safety of flight. Without an immediate alternative, people still have to fly, and they still would. Whereas bringing down perception of safety will end up leading people to call for new modes of travel, rather than having them thrust upon us when we already have better alternatives. That would play right into the hands of this &quot;transportation conglomerate.&quot;</p>

<p>Someone else informed me that last few years have been the safest for airline travel, but they&#39;ve also been the years to get the most media coverage on it. I mentioned in another reply that the increased media coverage could just as easily be funded by this most-likely imaginary transportation conglomerate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>jim stone has an interesting take that the incident was a remote-controlled plane crash at <a href="http://82.221.129.208/">http://82.221.129.208/</a>. in his explanation, he correctly pointed out that the descent and crash must have been due to wilful intent.</p>

<p>the official mainstream story is one of a pilot gone berserk (but not terrorism) which is pretty incredulous itself and supports jim&#39;s statement of &#39;wilful intent&#39;. IMO, Jim&#39;s explanation of a remote-controlled crash is at least as plausible as the official one, and explains the &#39;pilot silence&#39;.</p>

<p>The kicker in Jim&#39;s report is whether or not fighter jets were witnessed when the plane crashed. Jim posted a daily mail report that included witnesses who saw fighter jets fly past when the plane crashed, and a second daily mail report with the &#39;fighter jet&#39; detail expunged. </p>

<p>I think it might have been terrorism.</p>

<p>The plane was crashed in a remote area of France with nothing much but mountains around; and simply taking down a plane isn&#39;t impactful enough. We haven&#39;t heard from any &quot;Terrorist Group&quot; yet saying they did it, either. Not everything is a conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was a coworker of an American victim on CNN who was very composed and even smiled.  The girl hasn&#39;t even been at her  that long but the coworker claimed to know the victim well enough to give very specific, confident info about the victim and made statements like she had been coached. She then said something about the power of social media that just didn&#39;t sit right with me. Something seemed definitely weird.</p>
