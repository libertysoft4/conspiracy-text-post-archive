    <div class="md"><p>Okay. A little off topic, but this bothered me a lot so I&#39;m going to talk about it. I was playing this game online, it&#39;s called Pixel Gun 3D. Great casual game to kill an hour on. The age group is usually between 12 and 17. A few people my age (25) kicking around. I ran into a 14 year old. I liked his name, it was &quot;Regime Supremacy&quot;. It didn&#39;t really make sense to me so I asked &quot;what does your name mean&quot;. He goes on a long explanation about how he&#39;s part of a plan on another game where he uses this name. He&#39;s had it for a while so he kept using it. Blah blah. Finally I ask again, &quot;great, but what does it actually mean. How can you have the supremacy of a regime&quot;. His response made me so very fearful of the bed generation. He said, &quot;it doesn&#39;t mean anything, it&#39;s a name. Words in names don&#39;t mean anything; they just sound nice. Are you an idiot&quot;. I shook my head and left. It&#39;s a small example and very ambiguous, but I&#39;ve been meeting more idiots lately that are usually younger than I. It makes me sad. </p>

<p>He&#39;s probably been taking Ritalin since he was 6. </p>

<p>His entire life is online, on facebook, and in video games. His natural reward system, dopamine hits to the dome, only come through retweets or a meaningless achievement. </p>

<p>His school is a joke. He learns how to be complacent, how to bow down to authority. The Ritalin doesn&#39;t help. </p>

<p>The food he eats is full of man-made chemicals. Artifical flavoring. It&#39;s like that scene in the Matrix. </p>

<p>As he grows up, his dreams and aspirations are replaced with security and insecurities. His Ritalin is replaced with Zoloft. His dopemine highs still come from reddit karma and kill streaks. </p>

<p>He&#39;s not a man. But a lifeless drone in a man&#39;s body, carelessly floating through life, following orders. Completely oblivious to the real world, to live and die in the American Bubble. Complacent, comfortable, afraid. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I couldn&#39;t even imagine how frustrating that must be. I graduated in the early 2000s, before smart phones....but we still had camera phones, pagers, and texting. It was already frustrating our teachers <em>back then</em>, and its sooo much worse now. Even things like Wikipedia must make it a nightmare, they just use it as gospel. I hated it at the time, but I remember having to use index cards for my works cited, I had to go to the library and use real books for sources...like I said it was strenuous but it taught you that hard work was worth putting in. It was an experience, unlike staring at a screen and acting like it was the only way to live. I forget the exact quote, or who said it...but it was something like &quot;We&#39;ve created devices that have made us all more connected than ever before, and yet we&#39;re growing further apart than ever before.&quot;, implying that people don&#39;t know how to socialize or interact anymore without Facebook or things like that...it makes me so sad to think its only gonna keep getting worse. Sorry for the rant, but your post just made me reflect on something that&#39;s been bugging me for a while. I wish you all the luck in the world in reaching those kids and helping them develop a passion for learning...it seems like an impossible task these days. Cheers!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t necessarily say to accommodate blacks and Hispanics but I will say that I have to dumb a lot of stuff down in the classroom because schools insist on putting very low special education kids in classrooms with regular folk. I have AP level students in the same class as kids who can&#39;t read and have severe learning disabilities- the highest some of them can do is copy notes, if that. If you hold them all to the same standard, your failure are too high and the school will look at the teacher like you are the one screwing it up.

    <div class="md"><p>The saddest part of that is that the AP students arent progressing and evolving at the rate that they could be, the rate that benefits them the most. Its like a subliminal way of telling them that its &quot;not fair&quot; to the dumber kids that the AP kids are smarter than them. It&#39;d be like running a race and stopping to let slower people catch up just so the race is more equal and fair. Its funny, for a country thats so giddy about celebrating diversity, we sure seem to go out of our way to make sure everyone feels the exact same, regardless of our differences. It doesn&#39;t cultivate the intelligence of our brightest minds of the future, which is the real problem here. We already have a society full of anti-intellectualism running rampant. The least we can do is encourage the few younger kids that have a passion for learning and critical thinking. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s somewhat true though. There are certain educational standards where whites have to score a higher percentage to be considered for getting accepted than blacks. There are also universities that will accept a less qualified black student over an overly qualified white student just to specifically meet a quota. THATS racism. It&#39;s also anti-intellectualism and goes with what the original comment said...it&#39;s meant to provide an illusion that were all equally intelligent instead of providing an even playing field where everyone has to prove themselves according to one standard. I&#39;m curious, could you refute that or provide a rebuttal without appealing to your emotions, getting offended, ad hominem or just flat out name calling?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its simple, you can&#39;t judge an individual based on the performance of their race, they&#39;re an individual. to say that statistically minorities are less intelligent would be correct, but its because of all the socio-economic differences, not because their race.
Our education system is floundering because of the income gap and the poor way we run it. if there was only one race it&#39;d still suck just as bad.
Edit: But what you said was true, making it easier for a racial minority to get into college, or recieve financial aid is racism.</p>

<p>Why? Because that is the best advice for the foreseeable future.  Most certainly for the youngest generation (what is it now?  Millenials?)  There simply are fewer jobs for those in the Arts.  I suspect you are exactly the demographic I was referring to, judging by your response, and the truth still burns.  I could be wrong about that, in particular.</p>

<p>How do you think the economy could/would be changed?  What do you mean by &quot;resources&quot;?</p>

<p>I thought it was common knowledge that we live in a system of artificial scarcity.  If the parasites at the top were eliminated, there would be such a massive surplus for the rest of us we wouldn&#39;t know what to do with it.  And that is without touching the military budget....which I would certainly touch. </p>

<p>Like I said I do agree 100% that more children should be guided towards skilled labor and not have academia be the ultimate goal for every student.  However it is quite apparent that both problems could be solved with some restructuring. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not so sure.  The systems have been in place for hundreds, if not thousands, of years.  I wouldn&#39;t know how anyone could overthrow the current system in any relatively short period of time.  </p>

<p>How could it be done?  Another civil war?  A global war?  It would likely be something of that magnitude.  Further, like you said, what we know is far from &quot;common knowledge&quot; for the general populous.  The People would have to be cohesive, educated.  They would need specific goals and someone to guide their efforts.</p>

<p>I&#39;m all open to hearing your ideas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry you are right, I should have said common knowledge on this sub. </p>

<p>I cannot find the link but there was a study done that shows only a relatively small portion of the population needs to become aware and un-apathetic enough, things can change quite rapidly.  So spreading awareness is key.  Movie nights, reading groups, town meetings, etc.  Counter the propaganda as best we can, spread like a virus.  It doesn&#39;t necessarily need a civil war, probably very limited violence if done close to correctly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are spot on. Everyone wants to blame someone else, and while the world we live in is set up in a hierarchy of success, blaming the education that ultimately aided your awakening is not the place to start (try yourself first and then economic environment). After all, people here act like you&#39;re awake despite traditional schooling rather than realizing that you most likely developed critical thinking skills that led you to be awake through schooling. Its not a perfect system by any means but this idea of intentional dumbing down is fucking moronic. The average IQ has actually risen in the US over the last 100 years, and schooling has changed to permit all student whereas in the past it was rare to even get to high school. Those stupid past 8th grade exams fool the unaware of the historical context...it was a weeder test set early because high school was essentially college. People were learning to be mainly factory workers or in commerce...much more diverse today, with different needs. Are these being addressed? You have an argument either way but to act like its a conspiracy is one to which I do not subscribe. </p>
