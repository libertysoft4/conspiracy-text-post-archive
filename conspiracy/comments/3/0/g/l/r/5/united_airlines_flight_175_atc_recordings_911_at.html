    <div class="md"><p>ATC will almost never see any aircraft. Most ATC don&#39;t even have windows. Ground controls traffic on the ground. They would know about taxi for takeoff. Before takeoff they are handed off to the tower. Both the tower and ground are likely to see traffic. But at busy airports it&#39;s not likely. Which is why ground radar is used at some of the largest airports. Once takeoff occurs, the pilots will follow their fight plan, assuming tower doesn&#39;t deviate them and gives permission to change frequency. They change frequency to regional ATC (some exceptions exist). This is the ATC hand off and first notification of the flight to ATC.</p>

<p>From ATC&#39;s perspective, they only know where a plane comes from based on its squawk code and flight plan. If radar picks them up early enough, they can frequently infer the point of origin, especially in combination with type (included in flight plan).</p>

<p>Depending on radar, workload, and several other factors, nothing is out of the ordinary here. In fact, it would be exceptionally rare for ATC, during the day, to actually have time to notice every takeoff.</p>

<p>Edit: fixed bad phrasing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unless there is extraordinarily poor visibility the controllers in the tower ABSOLUTELY see the aircraft they clear for takeoff. Ground taxis airplanes to the runway, tower clears them for takeoff. Both of these controllers work in the tower, usually within feet of each other. The tower is a big room of windows. Part of the tower controllers job is visually verifying aircraft are following directions. Ground radar (ASDE) is only installed in bigger airports where using procedures for poor visibility taxiing would bring large parts of the NAS to a halt. It does not alleviate the controllers responsibility to use their eyes. ATC knows who and where this airplane is from the time it checks onto the ground control frequency. I don&#39;t know where you got the impression that the tower controllers aren&#39;t real ATC but you are incorrect. Most of what you said I&#39;d wrong. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean things could&#39;ve changed in the 30 minutes over been off position but I&#39;m pretty sure I know what I&#39;m talking about. The recording is from one of the centers in that are, I&#39;m guessing new York ARTCC. Those centers are connected in d enemy traveled metro areas to Terminal Radar control, or TRACONs, who are then connected to the towers. Of course the center didn&#39;t see that but take off, his airspace doesn&#39;t start for thousands of miles up. But ATC knows where every plane is under normal circumstances from the time they Begin taxiing at an airport with a tower. The &quot;regional control center&quot; you referred to is just one piece in the journey of an airplane from point a to point b. Just because this particular controller didn&#39;t see him depart a runway doesn&#39;t mean ATC as a whole are unaware of his location. </p>

<p>And the theory that ATC doesn&#39;t see people of the ground and that airliners just pop off airports with no planning or coordination with ATC is preposterous. You are wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The controller in the audio clip doesn&#39;t visually see ANY airplanes. He works at an end route center. Him seeing this airplane or any airplane is impossible. The original post went on to say that ATC doesn&#39;t see any airplane until they&#39;re off the ground and that is patently wrong. Any aircraft that operates out of an airport with a control tower, which virtually every air carrier does, is tracked from the time they request taxi to the runway to the time they exit their destination airports active taxiways for the ramp. </p>

<p>The pilot who says &quot;I didnt see a 57 take off&quot; assumes the a/c in question left from their airport.</p>

<p>Secondly the controller at NY Center had ZERO info on the a/c they were tracking.  Like another person posted, their are no windows.  This isnt a recording from a control tower. This is from an ATC Center.  The transponder had been turned off, so a/c make, registry, speed, were unavailable. </p>

<p>Just because people don&#39;t understand something doesn&#39;t make it a conspiracy.   </p>

<p>A phone called supposedly made from the plane (notice how there is absolutely zero background noise.) Also notice how calm she is. And finally, as she&#39;s about to hang up, she whispers something that at least sounds extremely close to &quot;it&#39;s a frame&quot; (some people also say it sounds close to &quot;it was great,&quot; which is weird too) followed by some erratic phone-hanging, the kind of erratic movement you&#39;d do after you&#39;ve done something you shouldn&#39;t have.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you can find the longer versions out there, but in short, this theory says that either the planes never took off or that their IDs were swapped in mid-flight (there&#39;s proof that this procedure is not only possible, but that the CIA had been fiddling with it since the 60s or 70s) and that the planes that crashed were not the commercial planes they allegedly were. What happened to the innocent people who actually boarded the planes? Only the CIA or US military know. If this theory is correct, I&#39;m 100% certain they were executed.</p>
