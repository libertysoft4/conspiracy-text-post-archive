Have now been accused of paedophilia and am basically being pitchforked away because the leaked documents reveal too much about the nature of the bollocks these people have commited to so deeply. OOH: UPDATE! The person who started this slanderous attack <a href="/u/damndirtylies">/u/damndirtylies</a> (aimed at the material of Edward Snowden....) is mod of an insane sub likely set up by the security services (as most of the websites of this nature are) <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/OccultConspiracy/">http://www.reddit.com/r/OccultConspiracy/</a> that basically exists to detract and distract from the serious problems happening in the world. Those who have a weak mind can simply enter this subreddit and talk about hand symbols and the likes while the world is destroyed by well known multinationals. So yeah... I know now why he doesnt want tangible evidence based claims flying around his &quot;gaff&quot;.... What a shill. He can falsely call me a pedophile sympathiser all he wants, and Im sure his JIDF friends are gna be here to upvote/ downvote for him. But it doesnt take from reality.</p>

<p>I myself, didn&#39;t call you a pederast and if you were even more informed about said subject you would understand why victims and family victims prefer that term over pedophile. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not here because I know it all! Sure as hell, I&#39;m not here to tell you what to think, what to read, what to believe! I&#39;ll be damned if I sit here and let you spout off about my truth, my intellect! Or throw this sub, as whole under the bus!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For a campaigner against child abuse you aure do throw the term paedophile around loosely, even using it to silence someone who is telling a truth that you dont want others to hear- And that leave only two motivations: Youre working for the flooders and youre helping spread this bullshit and therefore helping to rape and murder victims (which makes sense when we look at what subs you moderate.... ;) ) .

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m aware that I&#39;m likely not dealing with people who suffer form mental health problems here. Apart from that I would say you are likely suffering from something considering your continued loose use of the term paedophile sympathizer after I have repeated my stance over and over and even verified that I am not entriely discrediting all ritual type incidents.... and you do this while claiming to want to help victims... </p>

<p>And also this is Reddit, not my place of work.</p>

<p>Finally, you have speculated, make threats, assumptions and attempts at bullying someone for no other reason than your delusion overtaking any logical reasoned response that doesnt fit in with what you believe you know.

    <div class="md"><p>Oh really? Because this subreddit looks like a GCHQ flooders notepad from where I&#39;m sitting. </p>

<p>One example that is easily identifyable for most is anything to do with child abuse and how- in reality- it is being used by big business interests (with the help of the security services of many nations) to control any influential figures through a twisted, but fairly straight forward, paedophilic blackmail system.... A system that many people are missing because of the diluted stories and fake websites that obscure this obvious and well documented truth and talk of SATAN, checkered flooring and hand symbols instead! </p>

<p>Just trying to figure out if you&#39;re another satanism/pedophile sympathizer I need to add to my fucking list. They&#39;ve been swarming this sub like flies to shit since the Hampstead story broke, and they ought to be swatted for their bad behavior. Anyone who agrees that pedophilia occurs at high levels in the government but dismisses eyewitness testimony of satanic ritual abuse as &quot;moral panic&quot; or something of that nature is suffering from some pretty severe cognitive dissonance, or has ulterior motivations. </p>

<p>Do you think that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_child_prostitution_ring_allegations">Franklin cases</a> were also some kind of JTRIG operation?   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No.... You dont know- you never did know that- and THIS is your problem and the problem with people like you...
I&#39;m not sure of inidividual cases and I despise people who dilute these issues with completely unsubstantiated data and story-stuff that replaces tangible evidence as the &quot;top word&quot; on what is happening, but either way I dont think you need to bully people over the internet for their hard work and rational investigation into such a serious issue. 
Im very aware of flooders and all manner of GCHQ of five eyes alliance operatives who use these techniques and even have the public unwittingly commit to such practices with a sort of quasi religious faith... Ignoring solid evidence for stories of spells and wierdness that is more emotionally triggering and curious by nature.
If you failt to understand the main motivation of insitutionalised paedophilia then that is your problem, but please do not start throwing around insane under-hand accusation that are very suggestive and almost slanderous.
For the third time- People with lots of money and power use the security services in a game of political blackmail, centered around a culture of high-up paedophilia, in order to continue their persuit of profit by having absolute control of any major influential figures.- Get used to <em>that</em> and investigate <em>that</em>.

<p>No I dont believe that they are <em>only</em> there to discredit. I am well aware of many different groups who perform these acts, however to confuse that side of it with the political blackmail and power grabbing side would be to miss the cause of all of this entirely. The roots of all this is political blackmail, so naturally the focus should be on that and with it not on that this whole thing continues to exist.

I love your energy and am glad you are an activist. I just think we all need a cool head when discussing this. This is some crazy shit we are trying to expose. Real sick twisted stuff goes on in this world. This shit is prevalent and goes into the realms of evil (not that pedophilia it&#39;s self isn&#39;t, but sacrifices, ceremonies, etc etc). Continue the good work, but also realize that there could be a satanic/occult element to this. I think this is what they were trying to get across. Just my thoughts, cheers!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you, but seriously look over what this guy has said one more time. Repeated accusations of being a paedophile sympathizer. Truly sickening and it just goes to prove my point about <em>some</em> hopelessly confused individuals or groups within this movement who innocently think they are doing good while in reality they are doing a great deal of harm.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see it in the comments. I&#39;m trying to come between both parties. I think each one has over reacted and misinterpreted. I&#39;ve been here for a while and <a href="/u/damndirtylies">/u/damndirtylies</a> is just asking a question and trying to gauge you. Your post, does come off a little weird. I know we need to investigate it, but you cannot say satanism isn&#39;t involved. We simply don&#39;t know and it could be. Which is why we need to investigate every aspect. What is worse, a black mail attempt or a secret society that fucks and eats young children? What would do more to wake people up. The sex trade is already known, but if the elites are doing this on a spiritual level, that&#39;s ground breaking and will fuck our known reality.</p>

<p>edit: some words.</p>

<p>How it goes- People with lots of money and power use the security services in a game of political blackmail centered around a culture of high-up paedophilia in order to continue their persuit of profit by having absolute control of any major influential figures.</p>

<p>Yeah I know. But I&#39;m curious about this statement:</p>

<pre><code>A system that many people are missing because of the diluted stories and fake websites that obscure this obvious and well documented truth and talk of SATAN, checkered flooring and hand symbols instead!
</code></pre>

<p>Just trying to figure out if you&#39;re another satanism/pedophile sympathizer I need to add to my fucking list. They&#39;ve been swarming this sub like flies to shit since the Hampstead story broke, and they ought to be swatted for their bad behavior. Anyone who agrees that pedophilia occurs at high levels in the government but dismisses eyewitness testimony of satanic ritual abuse as &quot;moral panic&quot; or something of that nature is suffering from some pretty severe cognitive dissonance, or has ulterior motivations.</p>

<p>Do you think that the Franklin cases were also some kind of JTRIG operation?</p>
