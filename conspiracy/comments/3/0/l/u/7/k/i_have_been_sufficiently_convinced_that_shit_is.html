    <div class="md"><p>I concur with this post. I can see, personally, that more and more people are &quot;waking up&quot; as the lies and plots and self-contradictory events pile up. The question is: What do we do with it?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think violence is the answer. They can always more easily kill us; that&#39;s what they&#39;re best at. </p>

<p>We need some kind of organized financial pushback. That&#39;s the only thing they understand. We need a national strike, a mass refusal to pay taxes or for all students to stop paying off their loans, or some kind of non-violent resistance. </p>

<p>We could also consider trying to &quot;take over&quot; a city or part of a city, where we all converge and combine our economic and intellectual efforts. A city with serious but not necessarily insurmountable problems, like Detroit, say; as opposed to Camden or Ferguson, etc., Detroit is big enough and cheap enough that you could get lost there and develop a network before TBTB catch on.</p>

<p>But the key is going to be non-violence, that&#39;s the only way you win the middle. It&#39;s also why TPTB infiltrate these groups with violent subversives to the cause. </p>

<p>Good question. And good luck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed. We are long past the point nonviolent protest will do any good. My buddy had a good explanation on how Martin Luther King Jr. and Gandhi proved this. Fergusson showed people we are at the far point, violent opposition is the only way to uproot the wrongs and overthrow those in power, but two things stand in the way: The powers that be are strong (police and obedients), and the problem that white middle class America saw Ferguson as a &quot;black people problem&quot;. A lot of financially poor people realize this, but what&#39;s some chunks off the bottom of the pyramid? If the middle finally breaks, the top will crumble</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look at a place like Buffalo which I think is the kind of place you&#39;re describing. Not too fucked, but lots of room for improvement. Possible to rent relatively cheaply, existing arts scene, some interest in non-conventional politics.
Bring back the idea of communes, but this time, keep them in cities. People living together to keep costs down, rent and food costs down, share medical through private clinics. Also, people need to see that right now it&#39;s more important to vote in local elections and go to city or town council meetings since most of the fascistic control in the US is coming through local ordinances. The police state needs to be controlled at local level, especially since there is no longer any real democracy at the national level.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the key to everything:  The solution has to be the right and the permanent solution.  It must be based on basic principles that everyone can universally agree on.  The KISS principle applies.</p>

<p>To me, the fundamental issue of all problems is this:  No person whatsoever can be trusted with power and moral authority over other people.  We must form a society where we are individuals and have our own viewpoints without segregating ourselves into groups and waging petty, vulgar tribalistic wars like we see now with the Republican/Democrat illusion.  We must also know that the only way for all of us to succeed is to work and cooperate together in an honest way and one of everyone&#39;s free will.  </p>

<p>This idea of pointing a gun at people and using violence to enforce personal preferences needs to stop.  If you don&#39;t like a person&#39;s behavior, then, yes, social ostracism should occur.  You should not eat at that restaurant run by bigots and let everyone else know they shouldn&#39;t either.  Make people pay the social price.  We don&#39;t have to go around pointing guns at each other and ganging up on one another all of the time.  We will need a new age of personal responsibility where we all come together as individuals for mutual benefit.</p>

<p>We need rules, but not rulers.  Nobody should live by a different standard than anyone else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read a comment from different website the other day that stuck. They basically stated that it all doesn&#39;t matter. Even if you had video nailing down 9-11 (we do w bldg 7) and it&#39;s ring of conspirators, or 100% documented proof and photo evidence that Sandy Hook or Boston was completely staged (we do w the red finger paint and starving crisis actors) -- it all <em>still</em> wouldn&#39;t matter <em>one single bit</em> to the power structure and international banking/media cabal, who are basically playing with us like a whale flipping a helpless dolphin around in the ocean before finally preying on it.</p>

<p>Unless the apparatus has use for you or I as a &quot;victim&quot; or slave, where it can grow its powers by exploiting, we are nothing but pieces of dog shit in their eyes - plain and simple.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I would do everything in your power to improve yourself physically and mentally, eat real food and vote with your wallet (voting in politics is worthless, as they are nothing but puppets, regardless).</p>

<p>Be kind and considerate to those deserving, and call-out the sociopaths and double-speakers supporting the altered state (like I do), right to their face. If something is affecting your <em>actual</em> sphere of influence, do something about it. Otherwise, let the fake reality carnival on the MSM play-on until it eats itself alive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not to sound defeatist, but I&#39;m not sure if a movement or revolution would work. Those kind of things take massive amounts of organization and funding and are thus easily co-opted by the powers that be (see: occupy wall street). What we really need is a spiritual awakening (stick with me, I&#39;m not talking in the traditional sense) where people start to take FULL responsibility for themselves. </p>

<p>If 95% of a population subconsciously (and even consciously) want to be slaves and give away their power...then guess what, you&#39;re going to get leaders who are powerful slave-drivers. It&#39;s not rocket science. Whereas if everyone took full responsibility for his/her own liberty, we&#39;d NEVER let things get to this point. We&#39;d have too much pride. </p>

<p>This may sound idealistic, but I truly believe the next step for humanity is a revolution in awareness and self-knowledge. Violence is never the answer, and mass movements play right into the elite&#39;s hands.  </p>

Why are many corporations environment destroying, child poisoning entity&#39;s? Cause it works. Ask yourself ANY question of motives about what you see in the conspiring world and it can be replaced simply by &quot;Cause it works.&quot;</p>

<p>This is nothing new to Humanity and unless you are willing to accept punishment or a degree of asceticism [did you buy something you cannot 100% morally account for today?] its inescapable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have cracked my mind around this idea too (only i stated the problem as Capitalism) to change capitalism (from which all problems occur and stem) you NEED to be a capitalist, you&#39;ll have to co-operate with the system to change the system. But here comes the problem kicking in: how does one change the system from within ? Cuz as soon as your business is flourishing you will get these hawk eyed people swarming around you telling you to invest here, become member there etc. etc. Know this, capitalism with all its flaws, people doing power grabs etc, Will always be against the natural human tendancy to co-operate. Everything that human life should be like (preservation of nature, freedom of movement, freedom of education, work, food, expression etc) is f*cked up by capitalism/government. Lobbying being one of them. Capitalists and Government people are ALWAYS flirting with each other cuz the politicians want wat the capitalists have, and the capitalists want wat they have not (yet) </p>

<p>My advice : fuck the whole elite over by bringing technology to the open that rechanges the whole economic landscape (cryptocurrency&#39;s, bitmessage, the use of EHD electro hydro dynamics, EG electro gravitics ZPR zero point radiation) we the 99% have more intellectual knowledge combined than the 1 f*cking %. That&#39;s why we have lousy jobs and commercials to keep us distracted. Because think of this : if you don&#39;t get hammerd by things demanding you attention, what would you think of ? Life, and how it should be ? How we interact with each other ? This &quot;change or awakening&quot; some of you are talking about is already happening. Just let people know that technology&#39;s that are considerd science fiction are becoming a reality and that by letting others know of this you will hit a certain &quot;critical mass&quot;. (go and lookup morfogenetic sciences if you want to learn more). Mind over matter influences things TPTB cannot control. Your body is the lock, your mind the key. You are Salomons Temple,  the holy of holy. We are one, and one we will be. No matter the hardships that will come. It will change for the better. I share this subs concerns, i too &quot;suffer&quot; in that way.</p>

<p>Just don&#39;t give up, eat well, help one and another, don&#39;t go rogue (unless the shit is on, then group up find likeminded people and educate) </p>

<p>From the same heart and mind, much respect and love,</p>

<p>Jboss</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One day of everyone not working isn&#39;t going to accomplish shit. Let&#39;s look at some realities here:</p>

<p>1) You&#39;d never be able to get everyone in the country to just stop working on the same day. Why? Politics are too divisive here and even if you could get 10% of the population to do it I can guarantee you that more than 50% of that 10% would either be under 30 or in low wage jobs. Why does that matter? Because these are the people who can&#39;t afford to go long without wages so it would fizzle fast because I can also guarantee you 1-day of not working isn&#39;t going to bring the economy to a halt. Corporate masters will shrug and fire the lowest paid employees for not working or they will just wait it out. </p>

<p>2) I covered all the major points I wanted above. I was going to write out a bunch of shit and maybe I&#39;ll add more later but I think my first point pretty much hits it. </p>

<p>a) politics / no cohesion</p>

<p>b) no unions /no wage protection = people can&#39;t strike for days on end</p>

<p>c) a one day strike will have minimal impact</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying there isn&#39;t room for change... huge changes in fact. I&#39;m trying to politely relate that a one-day work stoppage is a fucking idiotic idea that will accomplish next to nothing long-term. </p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;m missing something or maybe I just wandered into the virtual version of an Internet dorm room with everyone smoking weed coming up with the next great way to &quot;stop the man&quot;. </p>

<p>If you really think a coordinated 1-day strike (<em>and again - BTW, good luck getting that together</em>) is going to have any lasting change I think you&#39;ll find yourself sorely disappointed.</p>
