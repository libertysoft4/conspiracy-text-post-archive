    <div class="md"><p>he says he&#39;s a marine but doesn&#39;t even remember what command he fell under. He also invented the title &quot;tier 3 marsoc&quot; (which doesn&#39;t exist) to give himself. Then denied it. despite the fact it can be easily linked to and proven he said it. Tons of inaccuracies in shit he&#39;s said. Maybe he&#39;s just an idiot but most people remember if they were marine security forces or MARSOC.</p>

<p>what got in on the radar was this post in <a href="/r/military">/r/military</a> where he was pretty clearly full of shit and I&#39;m pretty sure just making shit up to try to make us identify with him</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Military/comments/32zvnd/as_a_former_marine_i_remember_training/">https://np.reddit.com/r/Military/comments/32zvnd/as_a_former_marine_i_remember_training/</a></p>

<p>As you can see from the 2nd link there I tried to be polite and respectfulish and answer his questions. Dude took like 3 posts to bring Nazis into it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I saw those posts. Too many red flags. I was also convinced he was full of shit. Even in his PM there was one big red flag.</p>

<p>On the other hand, he mentioned some things in passing in his old posts that matched his recent statements. He also readily shared his photo and in the PM his name, platoon, some other names that could recognize him, year, deployment..</p>

<p>So he is either:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>hoping that when I don&#39;t confirm his background he can defend that it&#39;s due to my lack of investigative skills</p></li>
<li><p>telling the truth</p></li>
<li><p>seriously delusional</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I have some contacts. I don&#39;t mind sending few emails and see what I can dig out. I am now intrigued.</p>

<p>My interest now is only in his military background. I am not going to comment on the content of his other posts or reasonableness of the JH15 conspiracies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>he&#39;s also admitted he got an OTH for drug use &quot;on purpose&quot; which should wildly narrow it down. My guess is he was in the Marines like a year or something and was supposed to be a security guard who&#39;s ultimate goal was to get on FAST teams. The rest is shit he&#39;s made up in his head.</p>

<p>edit</p>

<p>mods/admins note I am only pointing it out because he publicly said it and wants this dude to identify him</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So basically, you lack reading comprehension and make stupid assumptions?</p>

<p>Read his comments. He is obviously constantly being attacked for his perceived lying about his military background.</p>

<p>I have some means to confirm whether he really served where he says he did. If I confirm it as he hopes, I will post it here (for what it&#39;s worth).</p>

<p>If he is telling the truth, I would be helping him. </p>

<p>Actually, I would be helping him any way. I can&#39;t get the the actual records. So I can either confirm his story or say that I don&#39;t know. There is no way that I can prove that he was lying and then use that to attack him.</p>

<p>What I meant with the quoted statement is - I actually disagree with most of what he says, but that will not influence how I check his military past and how I will stand up to his defense if he really is a former Marine.</p>

<p>TL;DR: I am doing more to help the person I disagree with, than you with your idiotic comments.</p>

<p>Yes, I thought he was full of shit. Fact that you are taking that statement out of context just shows how desperate you are to argue with me. That statement was followed by others that implied that he might be telling the truth and that I might be wrong.</p>

<p>He actually brought his background up. He is using his military background to gain more credibility for his JH15 statements. So I believe he would actually appreciate if I would confirm his background.</p>

<p>Besides, what are you trying to do? Are you his lawyer? Mommy? What are you getting from defending online a person that doesn&#39;t need your kind of defending? I offered to verify his story, he accepted. What the fuck is it to you?</p>

<p>He might&#39;ve appreciated it a bit more to not have a group of trolls calling him a liar and attacking his character in the first place...</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I just think it&#39;s funny that there&#39;s a group of people following a user around trying to discredit him personally without ever addressing any of the information he&#39;s posted.  It seems both pathetic and fallacious, and so I&#39;m questioning one of these people (you) in an attempt to figure out what you think you&#39;re accomplishing by doing so.</p>

<p>So far what I&#39;ve gotten is that you&#39;re doing it because you actually &quot;want to help him&quot;, which is hilarious considering you&#39;ve declared him full of shit multiple times and have agreed with all of the other people attempting to discredit him.</p>

<p>But now that I&#39;ve gotten my answer I&#39;m satisfied since it&#39;s pretty much what I expected to hear.  Carry on with your noble campaign sir.</p>

<p>Of course you can&#39;t prove that to me. I know what kind of groups I belong to. But you might want to prove it to others here.</p>

<p>Is this your usual MO? You make some big statements and attack people, but when you are asked for evidence you say that you don&#39;t have to prove anything? Is that how you argue for conspiracy theories as well?</p>

<p>You were in this thread.  The evidence is the four comments I cited for you which agreed with (and even directly addressed) that group of users.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the equivalent of you joining a group of people rioting and starting to throw bricks with them.  Then you get confronted and your defense is, &quot;I&#39;ve never even seen these people before, I&#39;ve never rioted before in my life.&quot;</p>

<p>Ok. I&#39;ll ask. But help me understand, what exactly should I ask that could confirm your story? </p>

<p>I&#39;ll do you one better. I&#39;m pretty sure I know some former 0311/8152. Or at least I know people that would know former 0311/8152. Why don&#39;t you send me your name. Or photo.

<p>I&#39;m very curious to see what they say. It said Tier 3 under my portal or whatever the site was that showed you career info. </p>

<p>I have been out for 5 years now. I haven&#39;t stayed in contact with anyone. </p>

<p>How would giving you my name or a photo help verify my being in the Marine Corps 5 years ago? </p>

<p>Anyways I get back to the states on May 22nd and before June I will have posted my dd-214 with a photo, maybe even a video. Because you fucking military folks are so eager to try and call people out and I truly want you all to eat your words. </p>

<p>But ok, let&#39;s assume that it&#39;s true. I hope you will post your dd-214 and I will gladly and publicly apologize for doubting you.</p>

<p>Actually, you posted your photo on reddit previously. So you don&#39;t need to send it. How would it help? Well, I can easily get to a number of other 0311/8152 that were there in 2009-2010. Since you were there at that time, one of them or their network would confirm it.</p>

<p>I would be happy to send few emails and ask around to confirm your story. No need to thank me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>why would we believe some random person off the internet who also offers no proof and almost no post history? They could just be some dude you know pretending to be a stranger to verify you. You&#39;ve already proven you&#39;re not above lying, removing posts, and banning people who disagree with you. You literally didn&#39;t know &quot;your&quot; own chain of command and thought FAST teams were part of MARSOC. They are not. You called yourself a tier 3 marsoc operator and then denied it.... while it was still in your post history. </p>

<p>If you want to believe in conspiracies and shit that&#39;s cool just don&#39;t act like you want to have a real discussion if everyone who disagrees gets banned and censored. Don&#39;t lie about military service to prove your point because clearly you&#39;re pretty fucking bad at lying.</p>

<p>FAST has no affiliation with Marine Special Operations Command. According to the 3 sources you have provided. </p>

<p>Wow OMG I was wrong, trolled and harassed for days over 1 incorrect statement. </p>

<p>I was still a FAST Marine, still deployed to Cuba, Still have OTH. And I&#39;m still a Veteran. Still have a beautiful wife in the Air Force. Still in Italy. Still Moving back when I said I was.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>whatever you want to tell yourself. I don&#39;t believe anything you say at this point. I&#39;ve caught you in more <del>lies</del> &quot;memory errors&quot; than I can count. I suspect you&#39;re one of those dudes was in the Marines for like 1-2 years, hated it, got kicked out, pretends it was on purpose, and now try to make your service sound all fucking cool by embellishing the fuck out of it when in reality you did fuck all but stand gate guard in cuba. If even of that&#39;s even true. </p>

<p>You posted shit about killing babies and keeping your honor when I will bet $1000 you never even fired your fucking weapon at anyone.</p>

<p>edit </p>

<p>also I refuse to believe even the dumbest fucking Marine didn&#39;t know his own chain of command so I don&#39;t think you were FAST.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>why do you claim I&#39;m harassing you when you keep replying to me. I didn&#39;t even plan to msg you anymore until I saw this shit show of a thread about how you&#39;re being conspired against. The only thing conspiring against you is your own fucking stupidity. Even <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> turned on you because you are being the exact lying, censoring, greater good makes it all okay idiot that they hate.</p>

<p>edit</p>

<p>also replying and then claiming harassment to ward off replies is a pretty bitch move btw</p>

    <div class="md"><p>why would we believe some random person off the internet who also offers no proof and almost no post history? They could just be some dude you know pretending to be a stranger to verify you. You&#39;ve already proven you&#39;re not above lying, removing posts, and banning people who disagree with you. You literally didn&#39;t know &quot;your&quot; own chain of command and thought FAST teams were part of MARSOC. They are not. You called yourself a tier 3 marsoc operator and then denied it.... while it was still in your post history. </p>

<p>If you want to believe in conspiracies and shit that&#39;s cool just don&#39;t act like you want to have a real discussion if everyone who disagrees gets banned and censored. Don&#39;t lie about military service to prove your point because clearly you&#39;re pretty fucking bad at lying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol sorry you refered to yourself as &quot;tier 3 marsoc&quot; which just implies your an operator</p>

<p>&quot;To my knowledge Fast co. falls under MARSOC. Like I said before we weren&#39;t tier 1 operators or anything like that. If my memory serves me correctly we were technically tier 3 MARSOC. &quot;</p>
