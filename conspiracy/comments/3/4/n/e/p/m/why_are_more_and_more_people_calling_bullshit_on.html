<p>Also, most people who reject the official story seem to be college aged young adults. They weren&#39;t able to actively engage in their own opinion at younger ages due to lack of interest, as well as school and parental brainwashing. </p>

<p>Older generations are generally more patriotic and resistant to ideological change. They were fully cognizant of 9/11 when it occurred, and so they were immediately exposed to the official story.</p>

<p>Young adults, however, are a threat because they do not believe the MSM, which is why government is tightening control over social networking. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m all for a sound argument. How do you explain that the towers came down as they did without the force underneath collapsing first or simultaneously? That&#39;s about 90% of the building. That is what is in question with Newton&#39;s third law of physics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>NIST says the beams weakened due to fire.  So the static force of the beams pressing up against gravity was removed.  The force of gravity took the floors etc down.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s a pancake thing.  Whole building didn&#39;t collapse simultaneously.  One or two floors go, and start carrying the rest with them.</p>

<p>[Edit: &quot;pancake&quot; is not quite the right term; floors did not move separately from everything else.]</p>

<p>Check this dude out, guys! Get some popcorn, because it&#39;s about to get good.</p>

<p>Okay, so you still don&#39;t understand Newton&#39;s third law of physics. Either Voldemort put some sort of witchcraft spell on 9/11 or the official narrative is false. Let&#39;s say that 25% of the building collapsed on 75% of the building. There is TOO MUCH FORCE from the 75% of the building to allow it to be entirely decimated. That is how Newton&#39;s third law works. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you are confusing static and moving forces.  Floor 80 lets loose because of weakened beams.  Drops onto floor 79, wrenches it loose from its own weakened supports.  Both drop together onto floor 78, which lets loose even though its supports are fine; they&#39;re not designed to stop a 2-floor moving mass.  The three floors drop onto floor 77, and so on.</p>

<p>[Edit: <a href="http://www.nist.gov/el/disasterstudies/wtc/faqs_wtctowers.cfm">http://www.nist.gov/el/disasterstudies/wtc/faqs_wtctowers.cfm</a> says it wasn&#39;t a &quot;floor pancake&quot; exactly like I described, but something a bit similar.  Stuff above collapses onto stuff below.]</p>

<p>“The structure below the level of collapse initiation offered minimal resistance to the falling building mass at and above the impact zone. The potential energy released by the downward movement of the large building mass far exceeded the capacity of the intact structure below to absorb that energy through energy of deformation.</p>

<p>Since the stories below the level of collapse initiation provided little resistance to the tremendous energy released by the falling building mass, the building section above came down essentially in free fall, as seen in videos. As the stories below sequentially failed, the falling mass increased, further increasing the demand on the floors below, which were unable to arrest the moving mass.”</p>

<p>In other words, the momentum (which equals mass times velocity) of the 12 to 28 stories (WTC 1 and WTC 2, respectively) falling on the supporting structure below (which was designed to support only the static weight of the floors above and not any dynamic effects due to the downward momentum) so greatly exceeded the strength capacity of the structure below that it (the structure below) was unable to stop or even to slow the falling mass. The downward momentum felt by each successive lower floor was even larger due to the increasing mass.</p>

<p>I&#39;m saying that NIST being &quot;unable to provide a full explanation of the total collapse&quot; means that there is no full official explanation of the total (global) collapse. And if someone is going to promote the official story, they shouldn&#39;t pretend that there is one. And they certainly shouldn&#39;t state that there was a &quot;pancaking.&quot;</p>

<p>Why are you trying to give a summary of the day of 9/11? That is not what is being discussed. I&#39;m talking about the global collapses of the Twin Towers.</p>

<p>Again, in reference to WTC1 / 2 &quot;We are unable to provide a full explanation of the total collapse&quot;</p>

<p>There is no official explanation. I&#39;m saying that&#39;s a &quot;nothing&quot; explanation. So it can&#39;t be backed up with evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The beams were said to have been weakened by kerosene. Kerosene will normally cook you a hamburger but it will not weaken steel. I&#39;ve used Reddy Heaters for years. They have a thin metal nosecone that heats up to help accumulate heat before dispersion. The thin metal lasts for the entire life of the heater without &#39;weakening&#39; or melting. There was no source for the forced air that would even make the kerosene burn this hot.</p>

<p>here&#39;s the math. It&#39;s impossible that the WTC frame could have gotten hotter than 537 F. with all of the fuel available burning on a single floor at perfect efficiency and none of the fuel being burned in the giant flash outside.</p>

<p>Finally, PLEASE NOTICE that in  the debris after the demolition the government story requires that we see the results of a gravity fed collapse. that would mean a pancake collapse and that would mean &#39;pancakes&#39; which is a term that means layers of squashed floors.</p>

<p>There WERE NO layers of squashed floors as the government version requires. There was SHRAPNEL as our version requires. Case closed.</p>

<p>Under absolutely  perfect conditions, which cannot be demonstrated to have existed in the completely invisible steel weakening inferno. </p>

<p>Steel doesn&#39;t heat instantly and most of the fuel was burned in the first two seconds.</p>

<p>The Reddi Heater makes a purposeful attempt to make the same fuel burn as efficiently as possible and yet never damages the thin metal panel that&#39;s directly in front of the fan driven flame. Most of the fuel was exhausted outside of the buildings. what was left had no chance of weakening the 280 plus upright beams per floor plus the floor joists. It&#39;s just a fairy tale for sociopaths.</p>

<p>The law of conservation of momentum was violated. Things never fall in the direction of most resistance and gravity does not produce shrapnel which is what the debris pile consists of. The government story requires layers of squashed floors which simply did not exist in the debris of the twin towers.</p>

<p>If the government is allowed to violate physical laws just by their say so then you could possibly be on to something.</p>

<p>Supposedly an inferno existed in the elevator shaft. It did not. One elevator was still being used right up to the collapse of the south tower. Fire Chief Orio Palmer reported two scattered flames on the affected 78th floor and to send up two hoses to  knock it down.</p>

<p>. Nothing in NIST&#39;s coverup can be demonstrated with forensic facts. Actually they speak the opposite that the buildings were demolished with explosive force. That is why NIST stopped their story at  the initiation of collapse and did not try to explain the actual collapses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those were airplanes that had taken off fairly recently, for long flights.  They must have had ten or twenty thousand gallons of fuel aboard.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible for that much fuel to burn &quot;in the first two seconds&quot;.  Got a source for that claim ?</p>

<p>And the buildings had paper and wood and carpet and people in them, which burn.  The fires burned for what, half an hour or so ?  And the impact probably broke beams and broke off fireproofing from steel.  No one says the steel &quot;heated instantly&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;Weakening&quot; a beam under heavy load is not the same as &quot;damaging a thin metal panel&quot;.  If the panel had been under load that required it to maintain full strength, the test might have some validity.</p>

<p>Quote from the FEMA report into the collapse of WTC&#39;s One and Two (Chapter Two). </p>

<p>&quot;If one assumes that approximately 3,000 gallons of fuel were consumed in the initial fireballs, then the remainder either escaped the impact floors in the manners described above or was consumed by the fire on the impact floors. If half flowed away, then 3,500 gallons remained on the impact floors to be consumed in the fires that followed.&quot;</p>
