    <div class="md"><p>I think Dr Wood has done excellent research on the issue, and feel she has a lot of good points and valid questions.  I think a new investagation will provide answers to them.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think the exotic theory is the way to get the typical person believing the official theory on board with the  demand for a new investagation.  Its obviously been hard enough for them to accept what most people see with common sense, in that the official story is bs.  It is a lost cause if you are trying to convince them something exotic was used, when no one knows exactely what it was. </p>

<p>I dont think her work is BS, I think if trying to convince someone we need a new investagation, that there are more believable hard to get around arguements to get them on board.  Imo anyway</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think her studies have merit, however, trying to convince someone that doesn&#39;t want to believe the theorys other than the official one of Dr. Judy Wood&#39;s analyis......  Might want to use a different arguement.  Hutchinson doesn&#39;t even have a full handle on his expirements, so trying to explain something he himself cannot fully do, is definetely an up hill fight.  </p>

<p>The fact they haven&#39;t released the tapes from the pentagon, not whats on them, just they haven&#39;t released them, is hard for people to rationalize.  And the physics of the &quot;collapses&quot;.  Without Dr. Wood&#39;s theories.  Which again, I think there is something too.  But never use that when debating anyone on the issues.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But if there was heat enough to melt cars that would have nothing to do with fallout. It would be thermal radiation or the thermal shock wave. Both of which would have &quot;melted People&quot; if it was strong enough to melt cars at the same distance. Are you suggesting that a nuke could melt a car but people in the same radius would be fine? Come on...</p>

<p>Also define &quot;clean nuke&quot;. Are those capable if getting hot enough to melt metal but nothing else? That sounds ridiculous. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I gotcha, I thought you were talking about radiation deaths.  No, anything hot enough to melt a car should incinerate a human.  And indeed, I remember seeing a picture of the outline of a human burned into the side of a fire truck, but I can&#39;t find it now.</p>

<p>A clean nuke is one that converts most of its mass into energy, leaving little mass behind as radionuclides.  As compared to a &quot;dirty&quot; nuke which dumps fallout everywhere.</p>
