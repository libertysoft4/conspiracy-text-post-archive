    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the hard truth:</p>

<p>There is no place on or off the internet that you can trust without question. None. Even if I had a source that had always been 100% accurate, who&#39;s to say that when the SHTF, they won&#39;t start spinning stories just a <em>little bit</em>. Or hell, maybe they&#39;re simply <em>wrong</em> sometimes.</p>

<p>For example, VICE used to be good. They gained their readers&#39; trust by speaking truth to power, exposing injustice.. Then came the lies. Their &quot;Russian Roulette&quot; series is a great example, presuming you understand what&#39;s happening in Ukraine. But a lot of my friends still think VICE is a great, subversive news source.</p>

<p>So you can&#39;t know who to trust, but you can know who NOT to trust. CNN, BBC, MSNBC, VICE... The big corporate media giants lie over and over. A good short-cut or &quot;litmus test&quot; is 9/11. If they parrot the official story or some variation, you <strong>know</strong> they&#39;re trying to mislead you. But you can actually learn a lot by seeing what story they&#39;re trying to spread. It&#39;s all about controlling frame and setting the narrative.</p>

<p>I made a public multi-subreddit with lots of good info, but you still have to vet it yourself:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/u/LetsHackReality/m/rabbithole">http://www.reddit.com/u/LetsHackReality/m/rabbithole</a></li>
</ul>

<p>edit: Added the 9/11 shortcut.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My guess is a MKULTRA operation. Motives:</p>

<ul>
<li>Provide justification for more invasive gun-control laws</li>
<li>Provide justification for more police presence, greater police militarization</li>
<li>Further inflame racial tensions</li>
<li>Promote the lone wolf narrative to provide justification for ubiquitous surveillance</li>
<li>Increase general atmosphere of fear</li>
</ul>

<p>Could be something greater, hard to say. To be honest, I&#39;m not following it that closely.</p>

<p>edit: The bigger picture on this is that TPTB are in the middle of a transition from soft (psychological) power to hard (military) power as a means of public control. And they gotta do it in such a way that it doesn&#39;t wake up half the country.. or, worse yet, the military.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dunno, maybe alien blue has problems with multisubs? </p>

<p>What am I following.. Bigger picture things. I almost see these shootings as a distraction anymore.</p>

<p>I&#39;m really interested in the deception working its way into the public consciousness. On Facebook, on youtube comments, twitter.. people are figuring the game out. TPTB are switching, slowly, to hard power.. but they gotta do it in a way that doesn&#39;t instantly awaken half the country. </p>

<p>And my friends, previously sleepers, are waking up. It&#39;s starting a social snowball effect. It&#39;s absolutely fascinating to watch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>TPTB? </p>

<p>I agree everyone is waking up. Shit I&#39;m 22 so I feel like I really didn&#39;t care until I had my first run in with police. And then i read up on prison factories and the rest was history. I really yearn to know more honestly but with information it&#39;s hard to trust any source the deeper I get, everyone has a boss whose pushing an agenda for someone whether it&#39;s the truth or not. </p>

<p>You can only really trust yourself. Run any news you get through your own filters of skepticism. That said, some seem to be more reliable than others. There was a thread about news sources recently:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3ajb47/there_is_so_much_conspiracy_news_its_hard_to_keep/">There is so much conspiracy news, its hard to keep up! What&#39;s a good, trusted conspiracy news source?</a></li>
</ul>

<p>It&#39;s interesting to think which segments of the public will wake up first. I wish we had a big scoreboard AWAKE vs. ASLEEP, and we could view it by state, county, race, gender, religion... Man that&#39;d be a crazy survey huh?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yeah the bugs are epic. The first few months the tarantulas made a game out of sneaking up on me as I slept. But the monkeys, parrots, and iguanas more than make up for it. Mosquitoes really aren&#39;t bad on the Pacific coast, pretty dry here.</p>

<p>Well just to calibrate your cost estimates, you can get a 2000m<sup>2</sup> plot of land within 500m of your very own beach** for $25k.</p>

<p>news for rich people tends to be less idiotic and pandering (Harper&#39;s, Financial Times, NYT,  MIT Technology Review, Haaretz). news for poor people (pretty much anything on network TV) is good for when you want to know what &quot;they&quot; want you to think.</p>
