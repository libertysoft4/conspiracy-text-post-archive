        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A long time ago we had a law that prevented <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State">elements of the federal government</a> from using programs like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_of_America">VOA</a> within American borders. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USn4ZLvLPNs">Why do we need to be told</a> how great America is? This law was referred to as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith%E2%80%93Mundt_Act">smith-mundt</a> act. Among other things it made these programs illegal to use on Americans. </p>

<p>I editorize the phrasing here on purpose. </p>

<p>The Smith-Mundt act, US Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948, specifies the terms at which the federal government can engage in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_diplomacy">public diplomacy</a>. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 amended this law to allow for materials produced by the state department and the BBG to be released within U.S. borders. </p>

<p>Interesting to note here that within a similar time frame (1948) the Office of Policy Coordination was also created. This organization engaged in lots of crazy stuff.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;...such operations shall include any covert activities related to: <em>propaganda</em>, economic warfare; preventive direct action, including sabotage, anti-sabotage, demolition and evacuation measures; subversion against hostile states, including assistance to underground resistance movements, guerrillas and refugee liberation groups, and support of indigenous anti-communist elements in threatened countries of the free world. Such operations <strong>shall not include</strong> armed conflict by recognized military forces, espionage, counter-espionage, and cover and deception for military operations. &quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 1948, Frank Wisner was appointed director of the Office of Special Projects (OSP). Soon afterwards, OSP was renamed the Office of Policy Coordination (OPC). According to Deborah Davis in Katharine the Great, &quot;By the early 1950s, Wisner &#39;owned&#39; respected members of The New York Times, Newsweek, CBS and other communications vehicles.&quot;</p>

<p>This was called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird">Operation Mockingbird</a>. It wasn&#39;t really detailed until the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities in 1975, aka <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Committee">the Church Committee</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The CIA currently maintains a network of several hundred foreign individuals around the world who provide intelligence for the CIA and at times attempt to influence opinion through the use of covert propaganda. These individuals provide the CIA with direct access to a large number of newspapers and periodicals, scores of press services and news agencies, radio and television stations, commercial book publishers, and other foreign media outlets.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In February 1976, George H. W. Bush, the recently appointed Director of the CIA, announced a new policy: &quot;Effective immediately, the CIA will not enter into any paid or contract relationship with any full-time or part-time news correspondent accredited by any U.S. news service, newspaper, periodical, radio or television network or station.&quot; He added that the CIA would continue to &quot;welcome&quot; the voluntary, unpaid cooperation of journalists</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With NDA 2013, its now legal for this to occur. Although, I&#39;m fairly sure anyone who watches Mainstream Media™ will see &quot;retired&quot; officers or people working with organizations closely working with elements of the federal government.</p>

<p>Let us also not forget that programs like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO">COINTELPRO</a> were quite real and operated in America from 1956 to 1971 in <em>an official, legal manner</em>. Again not exposed until the Church Committee. </p>

<p>Then we have tidbits like <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/mar/17/us-spy-operation-social-networks">this</a> from 2011. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The US military is developing software that will let it secretly manipulate social media sites by using fake online personas to influence internet conversations and spread pro-American propaganda.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also from 2011 is <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/another-runaway-general-army-deploys-psy-ops-on-u-s-senators-20110223">this</a> from Micheal Hastings.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The U.S. Army illegally ordered a team of soldiers specializing in &quot;psychological operations&quot; to manipulate visiting American senators into providing more troops and funding for the war, Rolling Stone has learned – and when an officer tried to stop the operation, he was railroaded by military investigators.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ever wonder if perhaps the people referring to &quot;the terrorist&#39;s successful social media campaign&quot; are talking about conspiracy theorists? </p>

<p>I posit that a form of these programs never stopped, but rather grew into something far more specialized. I also posit that we experience these programs right here on this site. </p>

<p>In order to get the full scope of what I am trying to put out here I&#39;d recommend watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_YLy6yZeaw">The Century of The Self</a>, reading about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-linguistic_programming">NLP</a>, reading about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memetics">Memetics</a>, and even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy">CBT</a>... </p>

<p>I make no statements on what I think the goals of these programs are, but at this point their existence seems pretty safe to assume. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=conjecture+definition&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8">We can also assume that the federal government has been preparing for something recently (as in the last 3-4 years, arguably much earlier) that resembles disaster relief, as if they knew a disaster was about to occur</a>. Again, I&#39;ll make no statements about what I believe the &quot;disaster&quot; could be, but if the federal government is gearing up for something what could it be?</p>

<p>It&#39;s quite difficult to trust basically any information you receive from anything these days, including this post. Not just the federal government, but also organizations like Stormfront, armies of Poes and Shills, Shitposters, SJWs, PR Firms, Lobbying Groups, NGOs, Useful Idiots, and the &quot;lolposter&quot; are actively mucking up the debate. </p>

<p>I created <a href="/r/utcognoscantveritatem/">/r/utcognoscantveritatem/</a> in a effort to document and expand on this premise, I invite all of you to join. Moderation will be heavy, but the reasons for such will be clearly stated. </p>

<p>Thank you for your time.</p>

<p>also, interesting sidenote. this post took me about 2 hours to put together, and before i started writing it i created the sub which immediately had ~6 users viewing the page. I submitted a few articles I cited in this post, and then started writing the post. i opened my overview to quote something I had written earlier and <a href="http://i.imgur.com/kEbn3nQ.png">noticed this</a>. Take that with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>Good on you dude. I&#39;ve put posts like this together on this topic and know how much time it takes. Well done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The church committee was the last breath of the republic. found this quote on the wiki</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the need to develop a capacity to know what potential enemies are doing, the United States government has perfected a technological capability that enables us to monitor the messages that go through the air. Now, that is necessary and important to the United States as we look abroad at enemies or potential enemies. We must know, at the same time, that capability at any time could be turned around on the American people, and no American would have any privacy left such is the capability to monitor everything—telephone conversations, telegrams, it doesn&#39;t matter. There would be no place to hide.
If this government ever became a tyrant, if a dictator ever took charge in this country, the technological capacity that the intelligence community has given the government could enable it to impose total tyranny, and there would be no way to fight back because the most careful effort to combine together in resistance to the government, no matter how privately it was done, is within the reach of the government to know. Such is the capability of this technology.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to see this country ever go across the bridge. I know the capacity that is there to make tyranny total in America, and we must see to it that this agency and all agencies that possess this technology operate within the law and under proper supervision so that we never cross over that abyss. That is the abyss from which there is no return</p>

<p>is kinda spooky looking at what we are aware of now, ~40 years later. Add drones, remove a few <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posse_Comitatus_Act">safeties</a> and Ignite... There&#39;s a lot of jobless Americans out there right now, and a lot of people are upset about something or another. </p>
