        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Here&#39;s the video: <a href="https://youtu.be/7PpsCCTMP8w?t=184">https://youtu.be/7PpsCCTMP8w?t=184</a></p>

<p>In it, you can clearly see the penthouse of building 7 collapsing first and the rest of the building coming down shortly after. All of the videos I&#39;ve seen prior to this, for some reason, didn&#39;t show the penthouse collapsing first. Strikes me as odd. If this was a controlled demo, how is this possible?</p>

<p>The video creator also goes in depth about the layout of the columns and how certain ones were weakened enough by the fire which were huge contributors to the ultimate collapse of the building. I have to say that after having watched this video, I&#39;m now less of a &quot;9/11 was an inside job&quot; person. If the government was involved in any way, shape, or form, I believe that at most they knew that terrorists were plotting to attack certain buildings with airplanes within a certain time frame but didn&#39;t have any other additional intel apart from that.</p>

<p>I still believe that Rumsfeld and Co. used the happenings on 9/11 as an opportunity to further their agenda in the Middle East, but I now believe that this was more of a coincidental &#39;plus&#39; to them rather than a planned false flag from the get-go.</p>

<p>What do you guys think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know what a dick move it is to make an argument on reddit without providing a source, but I honestly can&#39;t copy/paste on this phone.  I thought the History channel documentary had a lot of good, unbiased information in it if you feel like finding it on youtube.</p>

<p>really though the first thing is the only one that needs a source.  I am a laymen, and am wrong quite often, but I&#39;m pretty sure not this time.  for the second one you can just google &quot;skyscraper fires&quot; the information you&#39;re looking for will be like the first three pages of returns.  and then when you consider Silverstein had Tower 7 reinforced beyond what city code required, it&#39;s even weirder that this building fell and none of the others.</p>

<p>also, I bet there&#39;s a bit of money involved in evolution denial.  not so sure the same thing can be said for truther engineers</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw one with a blonde lady reporter doing an interview with a lady holding a baby where you can make out the boom.  the whole crowd reacts in unison too, whipping their heads around like something startled them.  you can see the tower in the video, an appreciable amount of time goes by before it begins to collapse.  there are also multiple eye witness (ear witness?) accounts reporting explosions, a couple of them first responders.  but even then, a demo company probably isn&#39;t going to spend effort to deaden the noise.  black flag operatives with high-tech US resources at their disposal?  no man, the whole 120 decibel thing seems like bullshit to me.  &quot;the noise wasn&#39;t loud enough&quot; seems like a pretty weak argument to me when the NIST supposedly has the technical data to dispel all these theories and choose not to share it.  and then there&#39;s the Silverstein &quot;pull it&quot; gaff.  hard to forget that one</p>

<p>there&#39;s just too many holes in the official narrative presented by a government that has lost all benefit of the doubt.  I don&#39;t know who dropped the towers, but I&#39;m pretty sure it wasn&#39;t a rag-tag group of Saudis who learned to laser-line a Boeing airbus in a couple of weeks.  and what the fuck was with that passport?  did that shit fall out of the guy&#39;s pocket as he was barreling a couple hundred tons of steel straight into the hellmouth inferno?  and then we had that same good fortune after the Hebdo shooting.  seems pretty unlikely for lightening to strike twice like that.  or is it standard operating procedure for these evil masterminds to carry photo ID every time they go out for a Jihad?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>FEMA did <a href="http://www.fema.gov/pdf/library/fema403_apc.pdf">this analysis</a> on a piece of steel from building seven.</p>

<p>The first photo you are looking at is a steel wide flange beam. The authors of the report say the cause of the melted steel was an unknown phenomenon.</p>

<p>Look at the way the beam has been corroded, the sharp edges, the swiss cheese appearance. Office fires can&#39;t do this.</p>

<p>Now look at and listen to this guys&#39;s experimen:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQu18DHuutU#t=10m34s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQu18DHuutU#t=10m34s</a></p>

<p>The beams cut by this guy with thermite look exactly like the FEMA sample from Building 7. </p>

<p>Listen to this next video.  Can you hear an explosion?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I84-_hcbtyU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I84-_hcbtyU</a></p>

<p>There is no reason that the partial collapse of  an outer portion of building 7 would cause the central cores to collapse simultaneously. That&#39;s the point, all the central columns collapsed, which supported the penthouse, at the same time and then the rest of the building followed.</p>

<p>The photos shown in your video show very minor damage to the corner of the building. no way that would cause the central columns to collapse simultaneously.</p>

<p>Your video shows very minor fires. Even at the height of the fires they were minor. I am sure you have heard that no large steel frame building have ever collapsed due to fire, Except the three that fell on 911.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a few fires where there were no collapse:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am saying that the damage to the side looking north, the side with the damage is minor. From the looks of the image at 4:43 the only columns damaged are the two at the corner, 41 &amp; 42 Now look at the floor plan at 6:12. There is no evidence that 44 was damaged. Understand that the numbers designating the columns skip. There are columns at every intersection of all the lines of the floor plan @ 6:12. There are little &quot;H&quot; looking symbols showing the columns. This means that beams at column 79 were for sure supported by columns at 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 76, and 80. And most likely also supported by 43, 44, 45, 46. </p>

<p>Go back to the floor plan at 4:43. Notice that the lower part of the building seems like there is no damage. Now look at the image at 7:22. First off notice that they show that all the far right columns have collapsed.  There are 15 columns there, only 2 were damaged. How the hell did they all collapse completely. There is no evidence that this happened. It is misleading.</p>

<p>Now look at the animation at 7:31. They show the collapse beginning at floor 17, but the photo at 4:43 shows no damage at floor 17.</p>

<p>Now look at the murrah building:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whether WTC7 was a controlled demolition, or actually indeed the first skyscraper in history to collapse due to fire, neither scenario excludes the high likelihood that 9/11 was more of an inside job than just &#39;allowing it to happen&#39;.</p>

<p>If Bin Laden did it, you can be damn sure he would be proud of it, and would have posted a multitude of CLEAR videos (not fake fatty Bin Laden) talking about how great Al Qaeda and Allah is for allowing this to happen.</p>

<p>Do we have that? No. The only &#39;evidence&#39; implicating Bin Laden is the same old stuff that intelligence agencies easily set up to implicate patsies in every attack they have organised over the decades.</p>

<p>I really think we need to move on from focusing on how the buildings fell, because its clear that the &#39;other side&#39; doesnt believe the evidence we have available.</p>

There&#39;s some hard to swallow statements in the official story, and some pretty absurd theories in the &quot;truthers&quot; contentions. If it is an inside job, they are never going to release any damning evidence - and if it isn&#39;t, people are never going to stop trying to prove that it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So now you&#39;re changing your definition of propaganda because you do the same stuff but don&#39;t want to label yourself a propagandist.  Got it.</p>

<p>At least you didn&#39;t have &quot;moving the goalposts&quot; in your list. So you&#39;ve got that going for you.</p>

<p>Either way, you&#39;re here, in a thread, where someone is saying &quot;hey, I&#39;d like information on this which disagrees with your views&quot;  and one of your posts (other than to me) actually contains useful information specific to what OP was asking about.  While you&#39;re technically &quot;in a group of like minded people,&quot; that pretty much ended at the beginning of this thread, as the dude identified himself as an outsider.</p>

<p>In this thread, replying to someone who admittedly does not share your views, how quickly did you start with, by your definition, propaganda?  Your first post?  Yup.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I would also argue that I&#39;m not conditioning anyone to accept my views. Especially considering that, for the most part, I haven&#39;t expressed what my own views actually are on many issues here at all.  I&#39;m anti-anti vax, I&#39;ve made that one clear, I suppose. Anti-fracking. Anti-censorship (and, by extension, anti-downvoting, though that&#39;s been called a lie). Pro-rationality (by extension, anti-irrationality).

    <div class="md"><p>If the penthouse was new to you then you did not see much 9/11 truth documentaries. In every big documentary it is shown and even often mentioned. It is misleading of the video producer to claim otherwise. He also misleads the viewer by not mentioning that NIST did not mention WTC7 in their first release. And it took them years after heavy requesting of 9/11 truthers for them finally provide an insufficient and highly criticized explanation (thermal expansion) to add to the NIST report accounts of WT7 that were initially missing.</p>

<p>Then the video producer shows a short exerpt of the model NIST did of the collapse of the WTC7 building. It cuts off whitout showing it all. Later on the building in the NIST model will twist although that is not what we saw on the real footage. You also do not know that 9/11 truthers and specifically architects and engineers requested the model data to verify the data, because they could not manage to have similar results within the boundaries of physics. NIST answered that they will not provide the data and that we have to take their word for it. That is not how science works. Scientist who are confident with their results and evidence would happily provide their data for being peer reviewed.</p>

<p><a href="http://rememberbuilding7.org/nist-collapse-model/">http://rememberbuilding7.org/nist-collapse-model/</a></p>

<p>So yes, the video is laughable, because it relies on the lack of knowledge about the real accounts of 9/11 and the truth movement. And this is called misleading at least. But it is done by such an amateur that it does not deserve being mentioned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The video was from 2012 and some people in the 9/11 truth movement explained every detail behind NIST and WTC7 around 2010 and since then nothing was added of significance. That is the reason I find it strange to see this posted as a new debunking claim. Keep in mind that it is easy to investigate nearly every aspect of 9/11 nowadays and find online all the different opinion of both sides discussed to any length you want. </p>

<p>The video does not mention that Giulliani&#39;s Office of Emergency Management hat foreknowledge that the building was going to collapse several hours in advance. Nobody died in this building because every person was evacuated. A collapse zone was then established five or six hours before the building collapsed.</p>

<p>But that undermines the reasoning for the rapid removal of the steel saying that there might be still people in the rubble. &quot;This fact supports the notion that the real reason for the unprecedented destruction of evidence was to cover up an unprecedented crime.&quot; (David Ray Griffin, Debunking 9/11 Debunking, p.202).</p>
