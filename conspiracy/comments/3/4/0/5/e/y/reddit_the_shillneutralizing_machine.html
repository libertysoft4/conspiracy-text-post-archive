        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I learned recently that there are sites online that will buy old used reddit accounts. They buy them for the purposes of astroturfing, or shilling. </p>

<p>The wiki definition of a shill is: &quot;a person who publicly helps a person or organization without disclosing that they have a close relationship with the person or organization.&quot; which is the definition I will use here. </p>

<p>Just google <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=sell+reddit+account">&quot;sell reddit account&quot;</a> and you will see how much of this account buying and selling there is going on. There&#39;s no other reason anyone would pay to buy old accounts other than to use them as puppets for shills. If you think of another one, say it in the comments, because I sure can&#39;t. </p>

<p>This means that certain people with say, 7 year old accounts they don&#39;t use now, may sell the account for money or bitcoin. There is a whole market built around buying and selling these old accounts, with middlemen and bulk sellers. It&#39;s not a small market.</p>

<p>The accounts are then brought back in to common use by posting boring, neutral memes about non-corporate non-governmental things, to make them appear like a normal guy who has just resumed use of the account. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/33y0zj/my_life_is_in_shambles/cqpgxoi">Here is a perfect example from today. Read all the sub-comments and you will see.</a></p>

<p>Then, once the account is established with baseline material that makes it appear neutral, then the account can begin to be used as a shill account. The account is then used to defend Monsanto or Exxon or Israel or the US army or whatever the script of the day is, for whoever wanted to pay for the use of the shilling service. </p>

<p>Now remember, once something gets at least about 15 upvotes, it&#39;s then out of the &#39;new&#39; and &#39;rising&#39; queues and it goes in to the main page of that subreddit and on to the bottom of <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>, places where it&#39;ll get many more upvotes. So if it gets 15, it&#39;s likely to get 1000, especially in a place like <a href="/r/adviceanimals">/r/adviceanimals</a>. </p>

<p>If account neutralization was widespread enough, we would see material that is extremely mediocre getting upvoted to the front page. This would be because many of the things coming out of the new and rising queues would be low-quality neutralizing material that shills are up-voting for each other, to give their accounts the appearance of legitimacy. Especially when combined with the declining quality of the votes of the average reddit user, this is a recipe for disaster (regarding the front page).</p>

<p>But in effect, this means that perhaps a sizable portion of the content of reddit may be things generated by shills neutralizing accounts, and is <strong>part</strong> of why reddit is so infested with mediocre garbage content instead of good content. </p>

<p>The buying, selling, neutralizing, and shilling use of old accounts is going on right under our noses, every day, and it&#39;s getting worse. Just wanted to make sure we are all on the same page when it comes to this stuff, because knowing about it is the only way to defeat it. </p>

<p>Just had to get that out. It&#39;s something to think about, that&#39;s for sure. I know we all see this going on, I just wanted to spell out some things I realized recently so we have the chance to all be on the same page about the details. Now, to go make myself a beef quesadilla. :) </p>

<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> reddit sucks in part because shills use old accounts to appear legitimate, and they post lowest-common-denominator content that gets a disproportionate number of upvotes from their buddies in order to make the accounts appear neutral. In addition to the actual shilling.</p>

<p>This and investigations by admins and moderators. It gives the account more credibility. This also gives the shill company more separation from the shill themselves, it makes it harder for them to be discovered. </p>

<p>You see an 8-year old account that has 500 posts to <a href="/r/knitting">/r/knitting</a> and one post about the police heros they saw today, it looks better than if the account is 2 months old and that&#39;s the first post. If you&#39;re going to go to the expense to hire someone to shill, buying an old account is a small expense.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why not flood their market with crap new accounts? Make scamming people trying to buy accounts so prevalent that the market dies. Just a thought. I don&#39;t know how the market works, but if there is any trust required, scam them out of their money. Unless they have some system to verify the credibility of the account before purchase, and/or you can&#39;t change the password after they pay.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can see the age of any account by going to the account&#39;s page, so that&#39;s public information.

    <div class="md"><p>I hear ya. I made that realization about a year back. It does help to spread the word via the internet, but that&#39;s hardly enough to inflict real change. If real change is what we desire, we cannot simultaneously be hypocritical with our actions. I feel just as shitty and helpless as everyone here, but I personally feel much better know that I&#39;m doing my part. What else can we do right? </p>

<p>Regardless of what&#39;s going on in the world around me, I&#39;m not going to allow that to tear me apart and waste my life. All that does is give more power to TPTB, and I will not let that happen with me. In any case, here are some of the things I try and do in my life: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>With everything going on these days with police brutality, I always stop and film when I see the police stop a citizen.</p></li>
<li><p>If there&#39;s a protest going on in NYC that I believe in, I try to attend if I have the time. </p></li>
<li><p>I&#39;m about to join a local 9/11 truth chapter I found on <a href="http://www.meetup.com">www.meetup.com</a></p></li>
<li><p>I volunteer locally through newyorkcares.org</p></li>
<li><p>I make an effort to regularly go to the gym, eat healthier, cook myself instead of ordering in, buy products that don&#39;t support the kinds of corporations I complain about, respect the environment, continually read and keep myself knowledgable and well-prepared to inform others when a topic comes up in conversation (I try not to be too annoying/negative/biased/pushy), I try not to smoke too much weed or waste time watch porn excessively, I socialize much more with strangers, make eye contact, be compassionate for anything people do that bothers me (very difficult in NYC), I picked up meditation and basic spirituality concepts that I use every minute of every day, and so on...</p></li>
<li><p>I regularly help/advise people suffering from mental health issues after having years of experience battling this myself. </p></li>
<li><p>I&#39;m a software/product designer and my line of work gives me the opportunity to create something that will better the lives of hundreds of thousands of people (health related). I don&#39;t take this for granted and do my best to create the best product possible. Sometimes this means fighting the internal politics and sole desire to generate revenue over a product that actually helps people.  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>In general, I just try to enjoy my life and be grateful for all that I do have (family, friends, relatively stable financial situation, etc). There are billions of people in the world suffering from much more serious issues than I have going on, and I try to never take that for granted. Our time on this Earth is short and meaningful, but I don&#39;t believe that&#39;s all there is to life and the universe. There&#39;s so much we don&#39;t understand about life and we&#39;re only just beginning to scratch the surface of other dimensions that we live amongst in every waking moment (quantum science). Who&#39;s to say what happens after we die? It could be nothing, but it also could be everything. I take comfort in the fact that we don&#39;t know anything for certain, and for me that&#39;s all I need to keep me sane amongst such evil and chaos. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dunno man. From what I heard, the mods are all the way sold out on subs that matter. It&#39;s fucking shillville in r/conspiracy--gotta keep that corruption covered up. </p>

<p>I do think people are waking up, but I doubt r/conspiracy is doing much to expose new people to the corruption. I was 100% convinced of manufactured terror events before I found this place, and besides it seems the shills pretty much overpower things here. They are paid professionals. They are highly trained. They have all day. </p>

<p>The thing is,  you can&#39;t prove that anyone is connected with anything...so all this does is leave it open for people around to scream &quot;shill! shill!&quot; at anyone who has a different view or opinion.  There are users here that have set out to specifically do this.  Can they be considered shills?</p>

<p>Even if they have an agenda, if you have solid evidence to support your beliefs, it shouldn&#39;t matter.  Facts don&#39;t care about agendas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I acknowledge that it fell at free fall speed for a period of time, but that saying it&#39;s impossible for that to happen in a natural collapse isn&#39;t scientifically sound.</p>

<p>Saying that it hasn&#39;t been witnessed before is fine though.</p>

<p>I would have a much easier time believing the controlled demo theory if the whole building had fallen in the same way, but you can clearly see the roof falling inward way before the rest of the building.</p>

<p>Also, there&#39;s no tell-tale controlled demo explosions or squibs (as seen in many many controlled demo videos).  Then people say, well it was thermite.  But, thermite has never before been used in controlled demolition, and there&#39;s only one shady paper with extremely shady samples saying that there <em>might</em> be thermite in the dust.</p>

<p>Like I said...the evidence is circumstantial.  I can see where the theory comes from, but I don&#39;t agree with based on the evidence provided.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Any evidence provided that would confirm the official story wouldn&#39;t be enough for you because you are in denial.  It works both ways, hence it&#39;s a pointless statement.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Does it not bother you that more money was spent investigating Bill Clinton than the 9/11 commission spent?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t have the cost breakdown for where/why the money was spent, so I really have no comment or care about this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Does it not bother you that you don&#39;t have mainstream evidence because all evidence has been covered up?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes it does, I never said it didn&#39;t.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All the steel from the buildings hauled away?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was strange, but they still had pieces to examine that were gathered within a short time after the event.  You guys are fine with believing a study done with random samples of WTC dust, held by random people for 6 years in an easy-to-contaminate manner, that says there might be thermite...but you can&#39;t stand the fact that NIST only had 150+ pieces of steel and will use this as an argument for a cover-up.  Makes sense...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Evidence of insider trading?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Insider trading happens all the time.  It&#39;s circumstantial at best.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The power outages on the days leading up?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, circumstantial.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The eye-witness accounts of explosions and the planes not having american airlines markings?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The explosions?  You mean that people said they heard explosions around buildings that were falling down and on fire?  How <em>weird</em>...</p>

<p>This is actually the first I&#39;ve heard about a place with no markings so I&#39;ll get to looking into that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The provable fact that cell-phones don&#39;t work at the altitudes they were supposed to have worked?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then it&#39;s a good thing all but two calls were used by the in-flight phones.  Also, the cell phones calls they say did happen were under 5000 ft.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The impossibility of the planes airspeeds and trajectories?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Impossible, no.  Unlikely, maybe.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The unaccountability and negligence of numerous higher offices of military and government?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You mean to tell me that mistakes were made during the aftermath of the worst terrorist in America?  Oh man...must be a conspiracy!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The lack of plane in the Shanksville &#39;crash?&#39;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The plane went straight down into the ground at a very high rate of speed.  What did you expect to be left?  (Oh, and there was debris, just not a lot of it).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The lack of plane at the pentagon?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There was debris in the field around the pentagon.  There are pictures you can easily find by a simple google search that show that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The many coincidental impact zones?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Explain.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Explosives not tested for by the investigation? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would have liked that to happen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Isn&#39;t there an overwhelming amount of unanswered questions?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not really.  There are always some unanswered questions, but many of the &quot;unanswered questions&quot; you guys have have been answered, just not in the way you wanted them to be answered.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Aren&#39;t you being disingenuous when you twist reality to confront the people who are simply asking these questions and challenge admitted speculations that are more logically sound that the official narrative?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not at all.  I&#39;ve twisted absolutely nothing.  Simply believing the evidence is saying something different than what you believe doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m twisting anything.  How come it&#39;s ok to &quot;simply ask questions&quot; when those questions are against the official story, but it&#39;s not ok to ask questions about the theories you guys come up with?  Anytime someone like me starts questioning the official story of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, I get labeled a shill (not by you, yet), insulted, called a liar, disingenuous, etc....when this is the sub where you&#39;re supposed to ask questions?  Apparently, you&#39;re not supposed to question the &quot;official story&quot; of controlled demo and gov&#39;t cover-up.  Heaven forbid!</p>
