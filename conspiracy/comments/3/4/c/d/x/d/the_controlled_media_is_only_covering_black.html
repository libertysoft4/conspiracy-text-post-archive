    <div class="md"><p>I absolutely hate this argument on here (and it&#39;s a popular one). &quot;Divide and conquer&quot;. I don&#39;t know what world you live in but shit is divided. Black people are marginalized and put down so much in American society its disgusting. The media makes it about &quot;oh those black folks are burning shit again.&quot; But never talk about why. They never talk about why because if we question the way police and society as a whole treats a segment of the population we will question other things too. We need to stand together with the blacks in this country and get some real change to happen. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>100% agree. While TPTB&#39;s definitely want to divide us over wedge issues at election time (media is complicit), we have to acknowledge that our black brothers and sisters are marginalized and &quot;hunted&quot; by the police state at an alarming rate. Just look at the prison inmate statistics by race in this country for evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that&#39;s what the OP was getting at. The media plays both sides to drive the wedge deeper.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s both though...</p>

<p>Police absolutely go after blacks differently than whites, no question at all.</p>

<p>But police will still shoot white people or beat them without consequence as well.</p>

<p>And the media wants to focus on just black deaths so they can have two sides bicker and fight. Racists are always going to say it&#39;s  black criminals fault, they won&#39;t be swayed no matter what. </p>

<p>But if the media were also showing John Geer and David Hooks on the news constantly then maybe racists would actually side with black people on something. The media doesn&#39;t want that</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely agree with this sentiment. </p>

<p>The media keeps us focused on the violent and &quot;menacing&quot; behavior of a small fraction of the black community. Even now--after perusing the headlines--I have no idea what&#39;s going on in Baltimore other than looting and rioting. <em>Why</em> these things are happening isn&#39;t covered. The goal isn&#39;t to have the public feel compassion or empathy... it&#39;s to instill a sense of fear and otherization.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps don&#39;t call them animals, then maybe you can connect with them at a human level more. They&#39;ve tried non violent ways of change for decades and have been suppressed. They have finally had enough, and this is the only thing that gets people&#39;s attention.

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, what does it matter to a store owner when blacks loot and burn down his store? Do you think he cares why they did it?</p>

<p>Second, blacks are criticized because they do things that merit criticism, like looting and burning.</p>

<p>Third, blacks are involved more with police than whites because blacks do far more crime than whites.</p>

<p>Fourth, we don&#39;t need divide and conquor tactics. Blacks are already divided from whites and always have been. The difference is genetic, and no social program can overcome it, as the experience of the past fifty years in American has amply demonstrated.</p>

<p>Fifth, there is no standing together with blacks. They hate us and always will hate us, because they know we are more intelligent and more capable than they can ever hope to be, both as individuals and as societies. Blacks build nothing, accomplish nothing, achieve nothing. Look at the history of subsaharan Africa. That is the legacy of the negro race -- nothing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well that&#39;s it right there, culture. Asian parents have the reputation of mercilessly pushing their children to achieve in school and that comprises their culture since everyone doing the same thing is the essence of culture itself.  If you are surrounded by people who don&#39;t exercise and have poor diets, it&#39;s quite likely that you will adopt such a lifestyle and yet many will still blame being fat as genetic. </p>

<p>For me what kills the genetics argument is that many racists also go after women as they believe the cornerstone of society is the traditional family unit so a woman&#39;s place is in the home raising children and not in a man&#39;s workplace because they are naturally less capable. Simply living and working in the world proves this is a loser&#39;s fantasy because I&#39;ve found that women are as capable if not more so than men (because maybe too much media (distraction) is directed towards men) to do any kind of job, from doctors, lawyers, engineers, business owners to driving cabs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your argument stems from the assumption that races can be considered of value over one another. In fact, European success has been luck and historical circumstance. Another historical circumstance has been the oppression of the negro race in America for its whole history and only legally stopped not even a generation ago. All those generations unable to accumulate and pass on wealth. We&#39;re unable to control the time and place of our birth and their accidental impoverishment as much their fault as a white persons relatively comfortable breeze through life, a result of INHERITED wealth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The establishment is expert at dividing America&#39;s anti-government sentiment along racial lines: white anti-gov protesters are called &quot;racist gun nuts,&quot; and blacks are &quot;criminal looters.&quot; Yet unjust laws permeate our lives and are enforced with excessive violence. Both races have legit grievances. The common enemy is out of control government; we should never let the media divide and conquer a righteous populist sentiment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, American society is based on civil disobedience. If in these stories the media would bring up the fact that most every freedom we won in history involved lawless protests (Tea Party, Whiskey Rebellion, Shay&#39;s Rebellion, slave uprisings, etc), I&#39;d give them them the benefit of the doubt. But they pretend like it&#39;s not a legitimate tactic of protest.</p>

<p>Right wing gun protests often times involve violating the law. So do tax violators. But in each case the media carefully uses terms and perspectives to keep common white and black people from joining forces against the corrupt establishment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Governments literally create false realities to keep people in conflict. That is so that populations remain fearful of each other and divided and do not unite to overthrow the elites. It is a part of a strategy of tension that has been employed for at least hundreds of years through governments and probably thousands of years through relgions.</p>

<p>It is not natural for people to hate each other like this. We are manipulated into it. The following is a passage from Howard Zinn&#39;s &quot;A People&#39;s History...&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Black and white worked together, fraternized together. The very fact that laws had to be passed after a while to forbid such relations indicates the strength of that tendency. In 1661 a law was passed in Virginia that &quot;in case any English servant shall run away in company of any Negroes&quot; he would have to give special service for extra years to the master of the runaway Negro. In 1691, Virginia provided for the banishment of any &quot;white man or woman being free who shall intermarry with a negro, mulatoo, or Indian man or woman bond or free.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>from another section:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bacon&#39;s Rebellion brought together groups from the lower classes. White frontiersmen started the uprising because they were angry about the way the colony was being run. Then white servants and black slaves joined the rebel­ lion. They were angry, too-mostly about the huge gap between rich and poor in Virginia.</p>

<p>The greatest fear of wealthy southern planters was that black slaves and poor whites would combine in another uprising like Bacon&#39;s Rebellion. One tool to keep blacks and whites from uniting was racism. Edmund Morgan , a historian of slavery in Virginia , wrote in his American Slavery, American Freedom that racism was not a &quot;natural&quot; feeling about the differ­ences between black and white. Instead, white leaders encouraged a negative view of blacks. If poor whites felt contempt for African Americans, they were less likely to join with them in rebellion.</p>

<p>White kids have better access to rural areas and more in-home training at hiding shit from their over-protective parents - and thus they get sneaky with their drug use. I&#39;ve seen paranoid white kids tripple-ziplock and burn shut their baggies to smell proof them. </p>

<p>i lived 50 minutes away. they knew that. when she didnt leave, they gave her a ticket for waiting for me! made up the cause. she fought it in court and won cuz her dad is a millionaire who won the lottery.</p>

<p>if she hadn&#39;t waited for me they were going to take me somewhere and do god knows what. maybe even kill me. I just know it in my heart that its true and thank god she waited and took the ticket</p>

<p>Saying &quot;maybe the the percentage is higher for blacks, maybe I don&#39;t know&quot; demonstrates that you haven&#39;t even looked into the issue enough to make an informed opinion, yet we&#39;re supposed to accept your sweeping generalization about the issue?</p>

<p>Educate yourself, don&#39;t let the media do it for you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re pretty much agreeing with my general point. The facts, including what you stated, are never discussed. One case is honed in on, the violence is covered, and it is made into a divisive issue. Of course showing data proving bias wouldn&#39;t fit the narrative of selling stories on emotion, it might lead to an actual discussion of facts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, American society is based on civil disobedience. If in these stories the media would bring up the fact that most every freedom we won in history involved lawless protests (Tea Party, Whiskey Rebellion, Shay&#39;s Rebellion, slave uprisings, etc), I&#39;d give them them the benefit of the doubt. But they pretend like it&#39;s not a legitimate tactic of protest.</p>

<p>Right wing gun protests often times involve violating the law. So do tax violators. But in each case the media carefully uses terms and perspectives to keep common white and black people from joining forces against the corrupt establishment.</p>
