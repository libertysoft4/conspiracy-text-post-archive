    <div class="md"><p>The Bible defines what a beast is and what the sea is for you. We do not have to guess. The book of Daniel and Revelation are absolutely clear in identifying the re-emergent papacy as the last beast.</p>

<p><strong>Daniel 7:17</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Daniel 7:23</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Revelation 17;15</strong></p>

<blockquote>

    <div class="md"><p>The Bible is the work of the Holy Spirit. There is confirmation of this via prophecy and history. The ultimate author is outside of time and wrote through men... but this is something you must discover on your own through thorough study. All of the symbolism used in the scriptures is plainly stated so that there is no need to guess what is being said. In fact, the prophecies in the book of Daniel are completely transparent and perfectly parallel Revelation... giving an incredible series of extremely detailed accounts that fortell thousands of years ahead of when they were written...</p>

<p>The book of Daniel is undeniable prophecy. Men cannot tell the future and the book of Daniel does exactly that. We have full confirmation thanks to the dead sea scrolls that the book of Daniel is genuine prophecy. It&#39;s one proof of many that the Bible is of divine origin.</p>

<p><strong>2 Peter 1:19-21</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:<br/>
Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.<br/>
For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>2 Timothy 3:15-16</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.<br/>
All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>1 Thessalonians 2:13</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://amazingdiscoveries.org/S-deception-Daniel-introduction-Nebuchadnezzar">The book of Daniel</a> written in ~600 BC has a straightforward, plainly written account detailing the progression of major empires before their time among other prophecies. The dead sea scrolls verify the age of the book. This is one example of many, considering that about a third of the Bible is prophecy.</p>

<p><a href="http://amazingdiscoveries.org/C-deception-chance-design-science">Science</a> also points toward the Genesis account. The more you study, the more it becomes rather obvious that macro-evolution/neo-darwinism/universal common descent is just plain garbage. The evidence for the flood is also rather astounding.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So because Daniel says so? Daniel was a man.  And evidence of a catastrophic flood is abundant, along with a myriad of other religious stories, fables, and tales of a great deluge that happened on Earth, which isn&#39;t surprising considering the size of the ice caps and what happens when they melt.

<p>I always thought, like you, that the Bible was just another fairy tale. It turns out I was wrong. The Bible is the truth and the rest of it is warfare against the Bible.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve studied all sorts of religious ideas with no attachment to any. The last thing I would ever touch was the Bible. I never considered it or even had any understanding of what it contained. I only wish I had discovered it sooner.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>.... This.... this is the single most IGNORANT thing a christian &quot;prophet&quot; can say about watching for the end times..... The world is on it&#39;s head during the end times... evil is supposed to be everywhere and nothing is taboo, all things are permitted, the church of god is no more, through false prophets, and gullible people, disconnected from the divine spark.</p>

<p>REV-18/19
“For I testify together to everyone who hears the Words of the prophecy of this Book: If anyone adds to these things, God will add on him the plagues that have been written in this Book. And if anyone takes away from the Words of the Book of this prophecy, God will take away his part out of the Book of Life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which have been written in this Book.”</p>

<p>Right there, Jesus warns not to tamper with the bible, or god will unleash even more vengeance than just the average person will receive during judgement. This brings up another point, though god think&#39;s were&#39;re stupid ignorant sheep that need a shepherd, he still punishes us for following a false prophet. Knowing that man is &quot;born with original sin&quot; and therefor evil until baptized into the church of god.</p>

<p>So.... where do we start on not trusting ANY BIBLE.......
Well first lets look at the various Ecumenical Councils. Incase you don&#39;t know these are giant meetings between major Judeo-Christian leaders to decide on and resolve disputes in the teachings of, you guessed it, the Bible. These are the same councils that decide the canon of the Bible. Men, sitting in high places, deciding if a person&#39;s message from &quot;god works for their religion.&quot; Many times these councils are the starting point for new christian denominations, a new shepherd leading still confused sheep, down a path they&#39;re not even sure is the correct one. </p>

<p>YET YOU MODERN AMERICAN CHRISTIANS SWEAR ON THE ACCURACY OF THE NKJV OF THE BIBLE. </p>

<p>KJV was translated from hebrew, to greek, to english... but not just once... it was translated and copied and retranslated, some parts abolished, some enhanced.... and this is the KING OF ENGLAND, A man who&#39;s family has maintained control through the monopoly of force and control of.... you guessed it... THE CHURCH. So he has his scholars translate a new version for his flock so he may shepherd them down &quot;THE TRUE PATH!&quot; Including the &quot;divinely inspired&quot; mistakes (IE: oh that typo was given to me by god, yeah, he wanted me to forget that comma....)</p>

<p>You say the only way to know if it&#39;s the &quot;Real Jesus&quot; is to pick up the NKJV of the bible and study it? How about you FUCKING LISTEN TO JESUS.</p>

<p>John14-5-7
5Thomas said to Him, &quot;Lord, we do not know where You are going, how do we know the way?&quot; 6Jesus said to him, &quot;I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father but through Me. 7&quot;If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also; from now on you know Him, and have seen Him.&quot;… </p>

<p>Right here Jesus tells you what must be done. Know Jesus, Know the Father, for no man goes to the father but through him. </p>

<p>Your own interpretation of your holy scripture (if you actually read the fucking thing) warns you that all churches and all bibles and all prophecies will be corrupted as time goes by and we get further from the crucifixion and resurrection. Yet you run around spewing &quot;READ KJV! IT WILL SAVE YOU!&quot; No. Look for god in your heart... Worship him, love and respect jesus and mary for what they did for mankind. Find Jesus, Find God, look inside yourself and find peace with the oneness of the universe and the great architect of the grand design. </p>

<p>That&#39;s for you religious folks at least... That&#39;s my take on Christianity. </p>

<p>Me? Im not religious, i study religion, but I study religions for the spiritual pursuit. I study what every culture has said about the &quot;divine creator.&quot; All belief systems are flawed, man can not make something that is perfect. That&#39;s kinda &quot;god&#39;s&quot; territory, no matter your religion. The best any normal SANE person can do is try and enlighten themselves through gnosis, affirm their beliefs in faith, and understand that as a flawed human, knowing you know nothing, is knowing more than most people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You just unleashed a bunch of stereotypical assumptions about what you assume I must be saying and what you assume I must believe... but honestly you missed the mark by a million miles.</p>

<p>The Bible points the finger directly at the Christian churches and Catholic system to expose their hypocrisy... which is why those institutions had to be infiltrated and corrupted. They get you to put the Bible down and dance instead, these days. Protestants don&#39;t even know what they&#39;re protesting anymore and not many people know the truth about why they go to church on Sunday.</p>

<p>So on one front I see where you&#39;re coming from. Your solution, however, is incorrect and what you say about the King James Bible is also quite off. I don&#39;t advocate anything other than the King James. The history and canon is tried and true. Such issues are why it&#39;s important to understand how the canon was chosen in the first place, etc...</p>

<p>The Bible is of divine origin. It is a textbook from God to prepare us for the annihilation of sin and the restoration to a perfect creation. We are here to learn who our God is and choose whether or not we wish to live in His kingdom. Those who choose death will be as if they never were. Those who are saved will see Eden.</p>

<p>As it was in the beginning, so shall it be in the end.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>List my stereotypical assumptions. Elaborate on being &quot;quite off&quot; on the KJV. Elaborate WHY you only insist on the KJV. Prove that the canon is tried and true, as well as address other supposedly &quot;divine manuscripts&quot; that aren&#39;t canon, such as the books of the apocraphya. Again, prove it&#39;s divine origin, without using &quot;men who declare it to be true&quot; through council or decree.</p>

<p>All your &quot;faith&quot; is based upon is decrees of mortal men that they are doing what god tells them. Where is the connection to the divine spark? Can you disprove my scripture with your own even? Can you locate anythign where specific mentions of say, the catholic church and the pope are actually god&#39;s will? Again, without it coming from the mouth of men, who your own book says is evil from birth.... I don&#39;t even identify as christian...</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmXBj2N9fhY">A Lamp in the Dark</a> is a documentary about the dark ages, the reformation, the events of fulfilled prophecy concerning the beast power, and the creation of the King James Bible. This piece of history is all but forgotten and extremely important for people to know... this power is rising again to once more reign over the whole world (and already does behind the scenes anyways).</p>

<p>This stuff is not coming out of the pulpits. Those who worship on Sunday are following the beast and not what the Bible says. What most people think and know about Christianity isn&#39;t the truth about Christianity (such as the idea that people go straight to heaven or hell when they die, or that hell is a place of eternal torture. Both of these are incorrect). When you actually study the Bible for what it says, you will find that there is no rapture where Christians are magically saved before some crazy event at the end. The Antichrist, the beast of Revelation, is here now and reigns until the end of time. It has been around for thousands of years now... People have just been deceived by the very power the Bible is a sword against.</p>

<p>As for why King James... the 50+ scholars that put in the work of translating it regarded the scriptures as God&#39;s Word. They were extremely intelligent men who worked prayerfully for years creating the best translation we have to date. With the King James Version, you don&#39;t have to worry about random ridiculous words being used everywhere in order to secure a new copyright and monetary gains. They also used the majority texts rather than placing emphasis on corrupted manuscripts such as the Alexandrian and Siniaiticus documents. The canon and texts used to translate were the same that Jesus quoted from. Jesus vindicated all of the source materials that were ultimately used.</p>

<p>Newer translations have ulterior motives, manipulation of doctrine, and include some bad manuscripts often. They aren&#39;t as theologically sound and include ridiculous difficult wording quite often because they can&#39;t use the same wording as the KJV if they want to make money.</p>

<p>If you can read the original Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek then by all means absolutely stick to the received text. It&#39;s beneficial to be able to refer to the original languages for clarity, sure, but with the King James it&#39;s not exactly necessary.</p>

<p>Ultimately, it&#39;s up to you to take the initiative and study the Bible. It&#39;s your responsibility and it is the key to understanding the choice you have between life and death. I encourage you to explore and learn.</p>

<p>God gave us His word, His word is the truth, and the truth shall set you free. The Bible reveals real history that has been covered up and rewritten... it exposes a battle for your mind and soul on a scale that is so big it&#39;s unbelievable. It is the truth, and it is God&#39;s Word. The only way to discover this is to get in there and see for yourself. Just be mindful of the fact that mainstream Christianity has fallen away from the truth, just as the scriptures say would happen. They don&#39;t follow what&#39;s in the book.. they&#39;ve gotten lost to tradition and deception.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, and what about the Holy ol&#39; King changing the Sabbath to Sunday? KJV is so authoritative.... they just left that out, right? The true birth of the savior?

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Oh, and what about the Holy ol&#39; King changing the Sabbath to Sunday?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s was the Pope&#39;s doing. There is no scriptural support for the changing of the Sabbath and worship should be on the Sabbath, not Sunday. Sunday is the mark of the beast.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The savior being white, though born in the middle east?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thou shalt not make thee a graven image... I don&#39;t condone the pictures of Jesus and I don&#39;t like seeing them, either. It bothers me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The miraculous conception that&#39;s shared through almost every major religion, coinciding with the days of the winter solstice?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The miraculous conception is unique. The winter solstice nonsense has nothing to do with the Bible and everything to do with paganism that was merged in at the time of Constantine. Jesus was born in the spring or the fall, not the winter.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How about some christian history, you know Saturnalia?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another pagan day that has nothing to do with Christianity. I don&#39;t celebrate Christmas, Easter, etc... they are a slap in the face to God.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh... and covering up those lies by re-issuing new versions for centuries... that smacks of godly intent...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rampant fornication of the churches with the world has led to corrupt doctrines and corrupt churches, just as the scriptures say would happen. My beliefs are in line with Seventh Day Adventism. I look at what the scriptures say, not all of this tradition and corruption that has become mainstream &quot;Christianity.&quot; </p>

<p>The Bible is true. What preachers are preaching most today is not Biblical. The Bible has lots of stern words for these Sunday preachers who have fallen away from the scriptures for this ecumenical and charismatic movement. Take Malachi 2:1-9, for example:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>1</em> And now, O ye priests, this commandment is for you.<br/>
<em>2</em> If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay it to heart, to give glory unto my name, saith the Lord of hosts, I will even send a curse upon you, and I will curse your blessings: yea, I have cursed them already, because ye do not lay it to heart.<br/>
<em>3</em> Behold, I will corrupt your seed, and spread dung upon your faces, even the dung of your solemn feasts; and one shall take you away with it.<br/>
<em>4</em> And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you, that my covenant might be with Levi, saith the Lord of hosts.<br/>
<em>5</em> My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him for the fear wherewith he feared me, and was afraid before my name.<br/>
<em>6</em> The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in his lips: he walked with me in peace and equity, and did turn many away from iniquity.<br/>
<em>7</em> For the priest&#39;s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts.<br/>
<em>8</em> But ye are departed out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble at the law; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith the Lord of hosts.<br/>
<em>9</em> Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the people, according as ye have not kept my ways, but have been partial in the law.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Behold, I will corrupt your seed.&quot; Does that not ring true with the stereotypical pastor&#39;s children? And this is just one small section addressing them... there are many more in many of the books of the Bible that address today&#39;s pastors who are leading people astray - intentionally or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All This, you prove my point yourself. How did jesus verify the KJV hundreds of years after his death? Prayerfully? so you think &quot;30 Scholars&quot; are correct about ALL SPIRITUALITY on earth... 30 men, dead hundreds of years ago. And what is the most commonly used translation? K J V.... It&#39;s the blind leading the blind. You&#39;re still putting faith in men long dead, instead of the divine spark within. And how are these false prophets you speak of cursed? Yeah... i see a lot of cursed preachers, pastors, and bishops now a days... </p>

<p>If you want to know what I really think... when you die, and you&#39;re confronted with the all-powerful. He&#39;s not gonna cast you into a lake of hell fire, he&#39;s not gonna send you to heaven.... he&#39;s going to let your consciousness rejoin his, learn all the mistakes and stupid bullshit primate-brained things you did and said throughout your 120yrs of Eternity, and if he had an opinion besides &quot;Thanks for helping me.&quot; It would probably &quot;God heres another one of those religious nut-jobs that thought they were correct, and ended up destroying my world with their self-fulfilling prophecy.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, how is the &quot;solution&quot; of educating yourself on spiritual matters, affirming through faith in both yourself, and your studies, and knowing that you&#39;ll never know everything, is wrong? Do you really think god is that unsympathetic that he can&#39;t see how simple minded we all are and how it&#39;s near impossible to discern fact from fiction, to doom us forever to &quot;nothingness as though we never were&quot; all for failing... what... an experiment that he created? To see if we&#39;d choose good over evil?  You think god would rather hear &quot;I&#39;m jewish/muslim/christian/Taoist/Hindu because that&#39;s what I was told, and taught from birth.&quot; or do you think he&#39;d rather hear &quot;My life has been led in darkness, lies and deciet, though I know not what I do, where I came, or where I go.... I&#39;ve tried to know you.&quot;</p>

<p>The former is a statement of ignorance and sloth. You know not all the answers are there, but you lie comfortably that &quot;you chose the right religion, cause everyone else says so.&quot; </p>

<p>The latter is a statement of humility and desire for growth, and change, to be closer to the divinity of the universe not through lackadaisical &quot;faith&quot; but rigorous and devoted studies of spiritual matters.</p>
