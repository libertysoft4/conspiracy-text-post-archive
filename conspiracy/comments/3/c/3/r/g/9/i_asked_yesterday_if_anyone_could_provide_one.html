<p>You received answers in that post. You claimed Salk&#39;s development of the standard you are questioning does not qualify.  It seems like you think everybody and everything should be questioned except you.</p>

<p>Regardless, Jonas Salk devised the double-blind randomized experiment to test the Polio vaccine in 1954.</p>

<p>Additionally, RDBPC is not ethical in some situations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Edit: Reviewed the Links..</p>

<p>Thank you for your response. So far it is the only one that addressed the question.</p>

<p>The criteria we are looking for here is simple and it is not mine, it is research standard. A clinical trial where a vaccine and an inactive placebo are used (RCT), and the vaccine is shown to be both safe and effective. Then this is repeated by other researchers and the results are replicated. From the link you posted &#39;To conclude, the major advantage of trial over an observational study is the ability to demonstrate causality i.e., cause-effect relationship. When RDBPC is compared with other research designs, the level of evidence given by RDBPC is nearly 100% and hence it is considered “gold standards” for comparison.&#39;</p>

<p>I did ask this 8 days ago and you posted about the Salk trial from 60 + years ago.The Salk Trial was not completed, it ended prematurely because it was found to be infecting people with Polio. It did not determine that the vaccine was safe and effective.</p>

<p>It was not repeated and there were no results to replicate.</p>

<p>Anyone interested can read the detailed response I put together here <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3b5c18/the_gold_standard_in_research_design_is_the/">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3b5c18/the_gold_standard_in_research_design_is_the/</a></p>

<p>It should bother everyone reading this that the only response so far relates to a failed trial over 60 years ago.</p>

<p>Now that we have again covered that situation we can fast forward a bit. here is the current vaccine schedule from the CDC. <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/downloads/child/0-18yrs-child-combined-schedule.pdf">http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/downloads/child/0-18yrs-child-combined-schedule.pdf</a>. Rather than point to a trial done on a vaccine no longer given, which does not meet with the clinical standards of a placebo controlled RCT, let&#39;s focus on one of the many that are now required?</p>

<p>The ethical argument is an interesting one. When a new drug comes out it is not known without proper trials if it is either safe or effective. But asking to prove that vaccines are both safe and effective is unethical?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok firstly stop treating all vaccines as the same. They are hugely different with a wide variety of ingredients. Just because pharma companies have tried to make a quick buck with some shitty flu vaccines doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t trust them all. You doubt vaccines work? What happened to polio? How many cases of rubella have you seen? </p>

<p>Now to answer your question. I just googled vaccine double blind study.  I guess you can&#39;t do that so I will link the top 5 results for you. <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470204505701017">one</a> <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(84">two</a>92388-2/abstract) <a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/60/5/730.short">three</a> <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673607609465">four</a> <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673607617449">five</a> <a href="http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=383571">six</a> <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X00003108">seven</a> <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673608605243">eight</a> <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2721012/">nine</a> <a href="http://www.uta.fi/ajankohtaista/tiedotteet/2009/85/Lancet.pdf">ten</a></p>

<p>I know I said I would link 5 but hey I thought I would link 10 since it seems you anti vaccers cant figure out how to use fucking google.</p>

<p>Edit: Link 3 is a bit weird as the lancet uses brackets in their addresses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for your guidance on how to do a simple Google Search. </p>

<p>In order to determine if a vaccine is safe and effective the placebo cannot be another vaccine. There must be a control group that is a true control with an inactive placebo.</p>

<p>Every one of the above links has this flaw. &#39;A double blind randomized controlled trial to determine if vaccine x does ----- compared to vaccine y.&#39;  </p>

<p>Here is a detailed response I put together that covers the topic a bit more. <a href="http://www.np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3c1ofy/dear_provaccine_posters_could_you_please_provide/csry0ub">http://www.np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3c1ofy/dear_provaccine_posters_could_you_please_provide/csry0ub</a>. In the 3 studies I addressed in the link we had to at least find the full text of the studies to see that the trials were conducted against other vaccines. In all 10 that you posted it is plainly stated in the link. </p>

<p>Please take the time in the future to read the original post so your efforts will add to the discussion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair point mate. I did come out swinging pretty hard after not taking the time to read everything properly.</p>

<p>However when I added the word placebo to the above mentioned google search I got a whole host of responses that answer your question. I have linked 5 out of 95,100 results. <a href="http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/194/12/1661.short">here</a> <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673686910445">here</a> <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673610607556">here</a> <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/307/6910/988?variant=abstract">here</a> <a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/76/5/713.short">here</a></p>

<p>There is a wealth of fucking articles out there. The only way you could have not seen them is if you never looked. As I said above yes some vaccines have been shonky dangerous products that shouldn&#39;t have been on the market. The issue with this is the amount of control big pharma has over drug administrations. Vaccines are not dangerous corporate lobbying is dangerous.</p>

<p>Just because it has the keywords in the title doesn&#39;t not mean it is what we are looking for. </p>

<p>We are looking for a vaccine trial that uses 2 groups. 1 is given the vaccine, the other is not. Then we want to analyze the results. </p>

<p>Again all these entries are comparing one vaccine to another vaccine. This does not tell us if a vaccine is safe, it only tells us if the vaccine is safe (or effective) compared to another vaccine. The criteria was outlined in the original post. </p>

<p>Honestly I really want to be wrong here. I would like to think that the most commonly held standard of efficacy and safety have been followed in vaccine trials and research. </p>

<p>I will review and get back to you. </p>

<p>Reviewed:</p>

<p>Here is the summary of those links:</p>

<p>Link 1 did not work. </p>

<p>Link 2 is comparing the vaccine to another vaccine. &quot;The gp350/AS04 and placebo vaccines were formulated by GlaxoSmithKline&quot;</p>

<p>Link 3 is measuring employee absenteeism not the efficacy of the vaccine. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m actually disappointed in you.  I would think someone who CLAIMS to be a Harvard grad would have much better arguments and responses.  Anyways, here is why there are no placebo-controlled studies for vaccines.  The argument you make works on stupid people, it doesn&#39;t work on people who actually have some semblance of intelligence . I guess that&#39;s why the cognitive-dissonance-having fools on this sub lap up your lunacy.</p>

<p>Infants wouldn&#39;t be able to undergo a placebo-controlled study for the same reason they don&#39;t work on animals - they are ignorant of what treatment and prevention are. The placebo effect, which is what is tested in a placebo-controlled study is a psycho-physiological response predicated on the individual receiving the sham treatment thinking they are getting the actual treatment. </p>

<p>Due to ethical concerns there never will be a placebo-controlled study for vaccines that are not novel. Medications in general don&#39;t always undergo true placebo trials. Instead, they are tested against already-existing medications. When someone is suffering from an illness it is completely unethical to give them a sugar pill instead of some form of treatment.</p>

<p>Here is what the WHO says about placebos (<a href="http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/94056/1/9789241506250_eng.pdf">http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/94056/1/9789241506250_eng.pdf</a>) – I can’t wait to hear you call me a “shill” for using the WHO…I’m already laughing at the thought:</p>

<p>First: Informed consent is necessary. Using children in placebo-controlled studies is already an ethically shaky idea to begin with, but withholding a preventive measure in an infant is even more so.</p>

<p>Second: “the study must be based on sound scientific rationale, and must be socially valuable and use scientifically valid methods.” Vaccines work – there is 200+ years of evidence showing that they work, so the rationale to use a placebo-controlled study for vaccines is not there.</p>

<p>Third: “The research must have a risk-benefit profile judged to be favorable, based on sufficient evidence from previous clinical and non-clinical studies.” Since vaccine work, and we know they work, there is no risk-benefit reward from conducting a placebo-controlled trial on vaccines. If you want titers, go get a vaccine and then have the titers drawn…they’ll show antibodies against the antigen (unless you are one of the rare few who does not have an immune response to the vaccine).</p>

<p>Fourth: “The benefits and burdens of the research must be justly distributed. For example, research must not be carried out on vulnerable populations for the benefit of more advantaged populations.” You can’t get any more vulnerable than an infant, so placebo-controlled studies wouldn’t be conducted on infants to satisfy the whims of some vaccine deniers who are ignorant of the science behind vaccines.</p>

<p>Fifth: “Should an intervention be proven efficacious in a trial, research sponsors and other collaborators (such as national or local governments) have a duty to make provisions to ensure reasonable access to the intervention by the population from which the research participants were drawn.” So, as you most certainly already know, vaccines work so the infants would be vaccinated anyways.</p>

<p>Since vaccines work, placebo-controls would never be used, instead when a new vaccine formulation is created for an already existing vaccine (I.e., a new formulation of the MMR vaccine) it is tested against vaccines already in use.</p>

<p>Placebo-controlled studies are only acceptable in two circumstances..and they BOTH need to be applicable to the vaccine:</p>

<p>First: ”no effective vaccine exists” such as is the case with the Ebola and Maleria vaccines being worked on.</p>

<p>Second: **”The vaccine under consideration is intended to benefit the population in which the vaccine is to be tested.” So a vaccine placebo-controlled trial to benefit the whims of vaccine denier clearly fails on these two points.</p>

<p>Moving on, the WHO states that vaccines are never acceptable when:</p>

<p>First: ”an effective (or partially effective) and safe vaccine exists and is currently accessible in the public health system of the country in which the trial is planned.” So there goes your idea about using a placebo-controlled trial to test vaccines already in use.</p>

<p>Second: ”The risk to participants of not receiving the current vaccine cannot be mitigated adequately.” Considering there are epidemics of pertussis and mumps in many regions of the US and a measles outbreak as well, the risks cannot be adequately mitigated to ensure placebo-receiving infants wouldn’t contract these horrendous diseases.</p>

<p>Calling for placebo-controlled studies for already-existing vaccines is a joke that vaccine deniers like to play. In short, it shows their lack of understanding of ethics, medicine, and science.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Science, which seems foreign to you, provides evidence.  And as a clinical scientist, I do not trust blindly any scientific article that is presented to me.  I evaluate it with the knowledge, training, and scientific acumen I have to determine whether it would benefit a patient.  Scientist do not claim to know it all and you surely do not give them a break for trying.  How are you helping mankind?</p>

<p>If you really believe some studies are &quot;avoided&quot; then why don&#39;t you embark on a scientific journey and endorse a hypothesis you believe to be true?  Too much work for you?</p>

<p>Most countries have health agencies that tasked with approving or rejecting medical products.</p>

<p>In USA, FDA is the agency with that mandate, and apparently many of the folks wearing the fda hat have very close ties with BigPharma.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is old news.  Maybe you are just discovering that BIG Anything colludes with the gov&#39;t, allowing their product to be fast tracked onto the market.  So your skepticism is warranted, but completely rejecting vaccines is clearly petulant.   Would you say every medication is harmful without benefits?  Why do you pick on vaccines; they were invented long before BIG industry influenced politicians.  If you were to reject products based on the industries influence on politicians, you might as well live the life of Thoreau for the rest of your life. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am by no means a doctor.  </p>

<p>The issue is not really that vaccines are based on what I call &quot;filtered&quot; science, the data they show is used to sell the product.</p>

<p>The issue is that more and more people are clamoring for obligatory vaccination, and this ... in my humble opinion would be a crime against humanity.  Folks that want to believe in the hype can go stand in line all they want, I prefer to develop natural immunity to whatever comes my way. Always have, always will.</p>

<p>Oh, here is an article ...with 5 clips embedded, from 5 licensed doctors who can most probably explain better than I why vaccination is such a fraudulent notion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The safety and effectiveness of vaccines is something that is widely accepted all over the world. <strong>The vast majority of people all over the world agree that vaccines are safe, and that they offer the most effective way to prevent life threatening diseases from wiping out mass numbers of human beings</strong>. It is, therefore, not unreasonable to suggest that it is up to the few misinformed, irrational people who oppose the use of vaccines to prove their case. The burden to prove that vaccines are harmful rests on those few to convince the vast majority of humankind that we&#39;re wrong and you&#39;re right. While it is true that there are  some risks, the number of cases where a vaccine may have adverse effects is so small that, when compared to the benefits, it really doesn&#39;t make much sense to even worry about it. The reason we know about those risks is precisely because there is, in fact, a system in place where every vaccine must meet a very strict set of requirements before it is ever approved.</p>

<p>Merck vaccine scientist admits presence of SV40 and AIDS in vaccines - Dr. Maurice Hilleman who was the developer of over 40 vaccines including  measles, mumps, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, chickenpox, meningitis and  pneumonia claimed they contain cancer virus.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dr. Diane Harper was the lead researcher in the development of the human papilloma virus vaccines, Gardasil and Cervarix. She made a surprising announcement at the 4th International Public Conference on Vaccination, which took place in Reston, Virginia on Oct. 2nd through 4th, 2009. Her speech was supposed to promote the Gardasil and Cervarix vaccines, but she instead turned on her corporate bosses in a very public way. When questioned about the presentation, audience members remarked that they came away feeling that the vaccines should not be used.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for your efforts. </p>

<p>Just because it has the keywords in the title doesn&#39;t not mean it is what we are looking for. </p>

<p>We are looking for a vaccine trial that uses 2 groups. 1 is given the vaccine, the other is not. Then we want to analyze the results. </p>

<p>Again all these entries are comparing one vaccine to another vaccine. This does not tell us if a vaccine is safe, it only tells us if the vaccine is safe (or effective) compared to another vaccine. The criteria was outlined in the original post. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for the response. </p>

<p>Honestly I really want to be wrong here. I would like to think that the most commonly held standard of efficacy and safety have been followed in vaccine trials and research. </p>

<p>I will review and get back to you. </p>

<p>Reviewed:</p>

<p>Here is the summary of those links:</p>

<p>Link 1 did not work. </p>

<p>Link 2 is comparing the vaccine to another vaccine. &quot;The gp350/AS04 and placebo vaccines were formulated by GlaxoSmithKline&quot;</p>

<p>Link 3 is measuring employee absenteeism not the efficacy of the vaccine. </p>

<p>Link 4 is the same as link 3</p>

<p>Link 5 - I was unable to access the full text without paying. </p>

<p>Please stop simply doing a simple Google search. This is the third time I have taken time to look at your links. After posting about this twice it is evident you either do not care that what you post is not fitting the bill or you are simply not paying attention. </p>
