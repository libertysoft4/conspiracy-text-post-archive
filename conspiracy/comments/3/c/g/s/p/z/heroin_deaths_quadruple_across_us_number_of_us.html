<p>One of the latest fentanyl victims was a 16-year-old girl from Glen Burnie, Md., Crystal Moulden, who was found in a Baltimore alley in June. Her family said she was a straight-A student and cheerleader until she began drinking and smoking marijuana, eventually turning to harder drugs.</p>

<p>It’s not clear what is fueling the availability of fentanyl now, but it has become a statewide and national problem, and one that is tough to stop because some addicts may seek out the high from fentanyl, which is 30 to 50 times more potent than heroin, Wen said.</p>

<p>It&#39;s one of the things we are doing in Afghanistan. We are growing opium over there that gets turned into heroin but that stuff isn&#39;t even going to America. </p>

<p>We are letting the Colombians and the Mexican cartels sell that stuff and bring it across the border and are letting them set up shop inside our borders and continue to let them sell it un scathed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonderland_Gang"><strong>Ron Launius of Wonderland Gang</strong></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>A United States Air Force veteran of the Vietnam era, Ronnie Lee Launius (37), <strong>had been convicted of smuggling heroin from Vietnam back to the United States in the corpses of American soldiers.</strong></p>

<p>Reportedly, at the time of his death, at age 37, police investigators throughout California – largely in the Sacramento area – had 27 open homicide cases they believed were perpetrated by Launius. In May 1974, he was arrested for and charged with the 1973 murder of a reputed police drug informant who had been killed over a botched drug deal. After a key witness for the prosecution died in an unrelated police shootout, the murder charges against Launius were dropped. That same year, however, Launius was convicted of smuggling heroin and cocaine across the US/Mexico border and eventually served three years out of an eight-year sentence in a federal prison. A California cop called the blond, bearded Launius “one of the coldest people I ever met.” Another policeman commented, upon hearing of Launius&#39; death &quot;I suppose they won&#39;t need many pall bearers&quot;. When asked to elaborate, the policeman explained &quot;A trash can only has two handles&quot;.</p>

<p>Launius was known for being cool under pressure. His associate David Lind once said of Launius &quot;You could put a gun to his head and his pulse would never break 70.&quot; His brazen and fearless nature led both to his dominance of his chosen profession, as well as his demise involving the events leading up to his death in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonderland_murders">Wonderland Murders</a>. He is buried in Lodi, California.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Arguably, Politics of Heroin&#39;s most notable feature was its documentation of CIA complicity and aid to the Southeast Asian opium/heroin trade. Along with McCoy&#39;s Congressional testimony, this initially controversial thesis gained a degree of mainstream acceptance. The thesis of the book was that most of the world&#39;s heroin was produced in the Golden Triangle.</p>

<p>&quot;It is transported in the planes, vehicles, and other conveyances supplied by the United States. The profit from the trade has been going into the pockets of some of our best friends in Southeast Asia. The charge concludes with the statement that the traffic is being carried on with the indifference if not the closed-eye compliance of some American officials, and there is no likelihood of its being shut down in the foreseeable future.&quot;</p>

<p>In particular, Air America, covertly owned and operated by the CIA, was used to transport the illicit drugs. At the same time, the heroin supply was partially responsible for the perilous state of US Army morale in Vietnam. &quot;By mid 1971 Army medical officers were estimating that about 10 to 15 percent of the lower-ranking enlisted men serving in Vietnam were heroin users.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On top of that, from experience as an addict, there are one shot treatments for Heroin addiction such as Ibogaine and Heantos. Both of which can be rendered useless by the use of Suboxone (the brand name of buprenorphine), a replacement/substitution therapy for Opiate abuse that blocks the use of Heroin and other opiates but also blocks any cures for addiction similar to Ibogaine. Ibogaine is a psychedelic capable of resetting opiate tolerance, ending withdrawal, and eliminating cravings with just one use. As it turns out, Ibogaine is quickly vanishing off the face of the earth as a result of poachers in Africa improperly harvesting the plant and the plant cannot be properly grown because it fails to yield the drug in a non-natural growing condition for unknown reasons (I suspect genetic tampering). This drug (Ibogaine) is Schedule I in the USA despite it positive attributes. And to much shock and awe at the hideousness of this system of drug trafficking, heroin found in many regions in the United States is often cut with Subutex, a buprenorphine (Suboxone) brand which lacks naloxone (prevents abuse by injection as it causes one to go into instant withdrawal), allowing injection of the drug alongside heroin, effectively preventing Ibogaine treatment and Heantos treatment, as well as many others I&#39;m unaware of I&#39;m sure. Heantos is a concoction of herbs developed by a Vietnamese doctor which can also detox the body of Heroin with minimal withdrawal effects in 5 days of treatment, and this herb mixture while legal in the US is rendered useless by the presence of buprenorphine in the system which can take up to 3 months to recover from after only a short time using. In other words, after using buprenorphine or suboxone (which can be found in small increments in most heroin in the US for reasons made clear by its effects in treating addiction) one must cease use for up to 3 months before Ibogaine or Heantos are possible treatments for heroin addiction. The presence of Subutex in Heroin while serving absolutely no purpose in effecting the high one gets from the drug (except maybe to keep from being sick a bit longer), is quite common and does act a means of preventing the addict using both Heroin and Subutex from getting adequate treatment. There has also been a lot of drama surrounding Heantos in Vietnam as 1 purported death occurred involving the treatment. This death has been disputed online as a faked instance made up by the Vietnamese government to deter use of the treatment, despite many reported users of the treatment claiming themselves to be cured of their addictions after use of Heantos for 5 days.</p>

<p>Suboxone is the touted cure for Heroin addiction in the US and other developed nations, but from firsthand experience is a crock of shit. It is basically just another opiate (a very strong one at that) with slightly less abuse-worthy characteristics, and doctors who prescribe it often dish out a rather high dose of it, far greater than the dose one actually needs to consume to fight withdrawal. Most heroin addicts use Suboxone as a means of biding time in between doses to save money and make the addiction more affordable, and very few users in my experience actually get clean from use of Suboxone, or end up taking Suboxone for years, only to end up back on dope or into a Methadone clinic, which is again another substitute for Heroin which is even worse than Suboxone. Methadone clinics gradually increase your dose keeping you addicted to Methadone for years and years before trying to wean you off if that ever comes. The withdrawals after years of abusing Suboxone or Methadone are EVEN WORSE AND LONGER LASTING THAN HEROIN. </p>

<p>I personally suspect that some entity corporate or otherwise, has a hand in systematically generating users of heroin using increased prescriptions to opiate painkillers which are increasingly more difficult to fill, setting up Suboxone treatment centers, cutting heroin with Suboxone, distributing heroin, and preventing effective treatment for opiate addiction all for the intended purpose of creating a heavily drugged population that both buys this drug in massive quantities, renders themselves low consumption outside of the use of the drug yet effective for labor, and also keeps them in and out of private prisons which are being used for a workforce of cheap laborers. This is all a scheme to create a massive zombie-like workforce that works, and exists off of a relatively cheap to manufacture drug and requires little other sustenance to function. Unlike the common view of the typical drug addict, these addicts are not nonfunctional dredges of society, these are people you see on a day to day basis that work sometimes in higher up positions, who devote more than half of their daily earnings to using an overpriced drug to function, often times a drug addict with a sustainable income will work crazy hours to maintain their habit, and you would never know they were on the drug. The face of Heroin addiction is quite different from the one perceived in the public eye, and the puppet master is (I believe, just from personal experience and common sense) someone closer to home and more powerful than one might envision. I see Heroin as a major tool being used to manipulate the population and its growth in popularity in the US is no coincidence. It&#39;s usefulness in making a person completely enslaved to the whim of those who dispense it is uncanny and there&#39;s undoubtedly some powerful people who recognize this long-term manipulation potential produced by this horrific and powerful drug.</p>

<p>This is the dark seedy underbelly of the beast in the conspiracy world that to me, ties everything together, tinfoil hat or no. Heroin is the evil key that the powerful people of this world can use to ruthlessly control those of us who don&#39;t willingly submit to the system. I&#39;m shocked this major increase in its abuse isn&#39;t mentioned more in this sub.</p>

<p>TL;DR: Powerful and evil people are likely using Heroin to control the population or are in the process of making it a tool for just that, and these same entities are rendering treatments for the drug useless instead favoring treatments that merely substitute it&#39;s effects, and do not work as a long-term treatment for addiction in most cases.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Finally someone has said it. I have a lot of friends that have gone down the opiate path.. Started with smoking blues now everyone is doing heroine and just trying to &quot;stay well&quot;. It is sickening. I can drive through parts of my town and can just tell it has taken hold of the area. It will only get worse I feel. Not sure if this is from the CIA or if it&#39;s being brought through the borders or what but in some way this is all connected. It&#39;s fucked up because like you said it is either suboxone they go on or end up at a methadone clinic.. A friend of mine goes to the clinic and man he is destroying his body. Love the guy but man all these drugs are really fucking over the population.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I had to guess there&#39;s an even bigger population of people that don&#39;t tell a living soul besides their dealers and their own contorted reflection that they are addicted to heroin. I think its the CIA permitting certain groups to bring it over, there&#39;s no way this much of the shit makes it over here without someone allowing this to happen.</p>
