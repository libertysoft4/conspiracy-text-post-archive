        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It seems like the Reddit hive mind, beyond but including /Conspiracy, thinks the stock market is going to crash in September. This will be due to QE ending, unemployment, housing bubble, student debt, post-summer conditions plus the China and EU crash. There was a crash in 2001 and 2008. 7 years is more or less an agreed upon trend time for a correction. So, the time seems to be fast approaching. </p>

<p>While it&#39;s a gamble, let&#39;s pretend it&#39;s true and the market will crash in the middle of September. How should one invest with this knowledge? Be it $1,000 or $100,000, those who seek to discover the hidden truths should surely profit from their exploration. Is it as simple as shorting the S&amp;P or NASDAQ? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pine nuts average $300 per tree per year once producing. 600 trees per acre. Mushrooms can be grown on the same land. Not much to do once set up except harvest. Land-based aquaponics, using mycofiltration is pretty sustainable and lucrative. Food forest, eco-retreat, lots of possibilities. I got 11 decent acres for around 2k an acre. converting it to pine nuts, mushrooms and an off-grid home. When my son hits 18, he will have an income source and place. Better than an education fund (which he also has).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been wondering about this A LOT as well, and any experts who chime in here are MUCH APPRECIATED.</p>

<p>But my plans so far have been:</p>

<p>Clear out my 401K, taking the 30-40% hit.
Buy Gold &amp; Silver.
Short stocks.</p>

<p>Honestly: All I&#39;ve really done so far is buy gold, and I&#39;ve got it stored in my bank&#39;s safety deposit box, which might be the dumbest place to have it if SHTF. I&#39;m hoping I&#39;ll have at least a couple hours&#39; warning to realize I need to get it out FAST.</p>

<p>Plan on meeting with my financial advisor in early August, sort all this out. But that&#39;s my plan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not planning on a SHTF scenario. While it is of course very possible, I think it will be more along the lines of a 2008-style drop. Unless you are over 60, I&#39;d be wary of dumping your 401k. Making up for the 30% loss from the penalty is significantly increasing your risk. Your 401 should be fine in the long run, again barring a SHTF or if you are of retirement age. If you are, then I would seriously considering getting out of the market now-ish.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is the thing, a lot of people are saying this ride of stocks going up will end soon and end abruptly.  Put options is one thing to look into.  I say look at places doing well now that cater to the american middle class for things they don&#39;t need, such as a large furniture store or even higher end grocery stores like Whole Foods could suffer.  Buying commodities won&#39;t hurt either.  If you are really desperate you could always hit up bonds, but right now they seem more like a way to protect your money than make it grow.  Another way would be just to wait and buy a house after the bubble pops.  You will get it cheaper than it is now, but I dont think the housing bubble will pop soon.  Once the market starts rebounding, I cant stress enough how important it is that you buy Berkshire Hathaway.  If you purchased Warren Buffet&#39;s stock at the bottom of the recession you would have got it at $75k (yes this letter is correct, thousand).  Right now the stock is trading at $ 209k.  So in roughly 7 years you could have made $135k on one stock.  If you have the means to invest in it, you certainly should.  Since most of us don&#39;t I&#39;d recommend going with his B-stock.  This stock is lower but it is because instead of constantly letting the price go up like his other stock, they do stock splits for it to keep the price reasonable for regular investors.  I hope this helps some and gives some sound advice for your investing.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is always hard to pinpoint when these things start and finish, but most point to devaluations as points of reference.

<p>Most economists look at this as a cycle. Mexico, then Russia, then East Asia happening in a chain. This is why people are so concerned with Greece and Puerto Rico, that they could begin another market contagion. </p>

<p>Personally I see Canada as one of if not the key player, along with China and the U.S.  Housing market in Canada and China, and equities in the U.S. </p>
