</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p>Under Daubert and FRE 702, when carrying out evidentiary gate-keeping duties under the Federal Rules of Evidence, <strong>judges must at a minimum inquire into:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>1</strong> <strong>Whether the opinion or theory is susceptible to testing and has been subjected to such testing</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>NIST fail - their theory is unproven and untested, there own testing, in particular, the material and fire tests conducted by NIST, <strong>did not support its initial findings</strong> They did not look for evidence of explosives, contrary to NFPA guidelines.</p>

<p>More importantly, any actual relevant sections of the official report <a href="http://cryptome.org/nist070709.pdf">are classified for public safety</a>, they will not even release them to a <a href="http://cryptome.org/wtc-nist-wtc7-no.pdf">licensed NYC architect in regards a FOIA request</a></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>2</strong> <strong>Whether the opinion/theory has been subjected to peer-review and publication</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The NIST report is not peer reviewed, it was and still is, self published and thus has zero credibility. In academia, peer review is used to determine an academic paper&#39;s suitability for publication.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>3</strong> <strong>Whether there is a known or potential rate of error associated with the methodology used and whether there are standards controlling the techniques’ operation</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>rate of error is 100%.</strong> That is, the previous rate of success in collapsing two 110-story steel skyscrapers such as WTC 1 and 2, by a fire ignited by jet fuel (even taking into account aircraft impact damage) and one 47 story steel skyscraper such as WTC 7 (which had no aircraft impact damage) <strong>is 0%.</strong> The official explanation of the destruction of these three buildings on September 11, 2001 assumes unprecedented processes and events in all three cases.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>4</strong> <strong>Whether the opinion/theory has been scrutinized and generally accepted by the scientific community.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>There is no general acceptance of the United States Government conspiracy theory in the scientific community. The official theory has been rejected by many qualified experts who have reviewed and scrutinized the NIST reports and the data that NIST has made available.</p>

<p>*There are additional factors considered by courts, but all four main Daubert factors are applicable to all cases generally (where the Federal Rules of Evidence apply or where the state courts have adopted the Daubert or similar test)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, let&#39;s walk through this post which has somehow received 30 upvotes. It&#39;s a good example of why people think you (conspiracy theorists) are so full of bullshit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The NIST&#39;s  investigation of the World Trade Center Disaster, that resulted in the <a href="http://www.nist.gov/el/disasterstudies/wtc/wtc_finalreports.cfm">NCSTAR</a> report, is inadmissible in a court of law in the United States, because it fails the <em>Daubert</em> standard, this determines the standard for admitting expert testimony in federal courts</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This correctly describes the purpose of the Daubert test, but is entirely inaccurate when it says that the NCSTAR is inadmissible because it fails the Daubert test. OP has failed to provide any evidence that any court has ever so held or has ever even applied to Daubert test to the NCSTAR at all. OP additionally fails (as discussed below) to provide support for his assertions that the NCSTAR would fail the Daubert test if ever subjected to it. Most importantly, OP&#39;s effort to misguide readers on this point is made clear below:</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/281a">The National Institute of Standards and Technology, on its own initiative but only after consultation with local authorities, may initiate and conduct investigations to determine the causes of structural failures in structures which are used or occupied by the general public.

</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>THIS is why the NCSTAR is inadmissible. The statutory authorization for expressly prohibits it from being used as evidence. The Daubert standard thus has nothing to do with its inadmissibility. OP is attempting to fool readers into believing that the NCSTAR is inadmissible because of its poor reliability/credibility. But the content of the report has nothing to do with it. The report is simply inadmissible by statute.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Under the standards established by the United States Supreme Court in <strong>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceutical, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 113 S. Ct. 2786, 125 L.

</blockquote>

<p>This is pure conjecture, especially given that there is no need to apply Daubert to the NCSTAR given its statutory inadmissibility. But let&#39;s look at the analysis OP provides anyway.</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>1</strong> <strong>Whether the opinion or theory is susceptible to testing and has been subjected to such testing</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>NIST fail - their theory is unproven and untested, there own testing, in particular, the material and fire tests conducted by NIST, <strong>did not support its initial findings</strong> They did not look for evidence of explosives, contrary to NFPA guidelines.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OP provides no sources for any of this. Is it an invitation to review the entire NCSTAR to determine the accuracy of OP&#39;s claims? I politely decline. Given the obvious effort OP put into this post, OP&#39;s failure to provide a source gives the impression that there is no source to be cited because his statements are inaccurate.</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>2</strong> <strong>Whether the opinion/theory has been subjected to peer-review and publication</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The NIST report is not peer reviewed, it was and still is, self published and thus has zero credibility. In academia, peer review is used to determine an academic paper&#39;s suitability for publication.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, no sources whatsoever. None. Absolutely zero.</p>

<p>What? According the link you provided, it&#39;s inadmissible because 15 U.S. Code § 281a doesn&#39;t allow it to be admitted. Has it ever failed the Daubert test in court? Has any court ever even applied the Daubert test to it?</p>

<p>The report is of such poor worth that it would be unlikely to be submitted, because it is inadmissible as scientific evidence and thus by proxy fails the <em>Daubert</em> standard.</p>

<p>Not 47-storey tall ones. And certainly not 110-storey tall ones. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tallest_voluntarily_demolished_buildings">According to this list</a> the tallest building brought down with explosives was, in fact, only 32 storeys. So, we are expected to believe that on one day, three buildings, up to 360% of the previous highest ever, were perfectly demolished, something never done before or since. Yeah, that&#39;s a 0% rate. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Well, if you don&#39;t count</p>

<p>• Site and Sound Theater
• McCormick Place
• Kader Toy Factory
• Mumbai High North Platform
• World Trade Center 5
• Dogwood Elementary School
• Windsor Tower
• Faculty of Architecture Building</p>

<p>Now, obviously, none are perfect parallels with the WTC. But your claim - and I quote - &quot;no steel framed building has ever collapsed&quot; - is simply not true. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>The problem is, the majority was so overwhelming - 96%! - that even if only one in ten had read the NIST report, that would still be a 2-1 majority over the pitiful 4% [as I&#39;ve mentioned before, that&#39;s the same percentage who think alien lizards run the planet] in favor of re-opening the report. And that also presumes everyone who voted in favor had analyzed the NIST report, which is about as credible as believing everyone in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has done so. </p>

<p>I certainly don&#39;t argue the NIST report is perfect [my own theory is that, if there is a cover-up, it&#39;s more to do with weaknesses in the construction, that could potentially be a threat to other buildings of that era]. But it&#39;s much more substantial than anything the 9/11 Truth movement has been able to offer, which is little better than &quot;Magic fairies sprinkled nanothermite pixie dust on the buildings.&quot; </p>

<p>You conveniently ignore the fact that never ever a tall, slender, free-standing structure completely collapsed straight down through itself progressively from top to bottom; that the only explanation given is the assumtion that such a collapse mode is &quot;inevitable&quot; when the top 1/4 of a tower drops on the lower 3/4; and that in 14 years, there has been no experimental model proving that premise right. 9/11 Truth does not require magix pixie dust; finding it only served as <em>confirmation</em>.</p>

<p>None of which displayed a total progressive collapse.</p>

<p>At least you agree magic pixie dust is necessary. For <strong>never</strong> has a 110-storey building been taken down with explosive demolition. And nowhere else has a 110-storey building had a jet airplane flown into it at 600 mph. But both times it happened, the building in question subsequently collapsed. That&#39;s a 100% rate, in case you missed it. </p>

<p>I thought you were smarter than that. Correlation does not equal causation. Classic beginner&#39;s mistake. Bad logic. Bad, bad logic.</p>

<p>Bullshit. The goalposts are where they were. There is a huge difference between partial collapses/disproportional collapses and a &quot;total&quot; or &quot;global&quot; progressive collapse. One is trivial to replicate in experiment, the other isn&#39;t, your guess which is which. </p>

<p>You will be surprised to hear that this statement is wrong then. I can name one building, not even a steel framed one AFAIK, much smaller and weaker than the Twins, that collapsed only <em>partially</em> when hit by a Boeing 747-200F.</p>

<p>Skyscrapers were hit by planes before. Smaller and slower planes, into smaller and much older and heavier skyscrapers. So what. The Twins swayed a little and stood. The planes can&#39;t have caused <em>that</em> much destruction. What are we talking about? 170 tons of plane against ~500000 tons of building. Do the math. </p>

<p>Oh, yeah. The B-25 into the Empire State Building. A plane about 1/7th the mass, traveling at less than one-half the speed. In other words, packing about 3% of the kinetic energy of the planes on 9/11, even ignoring completely the much smaller fuel load. </p>

<p>Actually, it is according to <em>your</em> science that they would have collapsed without being hit or something. All you would need to do is simultaneously blow away all the columns in one floor 3/4 way up and the thing would totally collapse.

<p>And that model is clearly wrong for a million reasons. The best of which is that there is no experiment proving it right - and the experiments that <em>do</em> replicate the model all require additional forms of energy - you claim wasn&#39;t there and couldn&#39;t be there. </p>

<p><del>Hypothesis</del>  Scientific Theory  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Many will claim that I should be calling this a hypothesis rather than a theory. However, let’s look at how others define a scientific theory. The United States National Academy of Sciences says:  </p>

<p>The formal scientific definition of “theory” is quite different from the everyday meaning of the word. It refers to a comprehensive explanation of some aspect of nature that is supported by a vast body of evidence. Many scientific theories are so well established that no new evidence is likely to alter them substantially. For example, no new evidence will demonstrate that the Earth does not orbit around the sun (heliocentric theory), or that living things are not made of cells (cell theory), that matter is not composed of atoms, or that the surface of the Earth is not divided into solid plates that have moved over geological timescales (the theory of plate tectonics)…One of the most useful properties of scientific theories is that they can be used to make predictions about natural events or phenomena that have not yet been observed.[1]  </p>

<p>The American Association for the Advancement of Science says:</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>A scientific theory is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world, based on a body of facts that have been repeatedly confirmed through observation and experiment. Such fact-supported theories are not “guesses” but reliable accounts of the real world. The theory of biological evolution is more than “just a theory.” It is as factual an explanation of the universe as the atomic theory of matter or the germ theory of disease. Our understanding of gravity is still a work in progress. But the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is an accepted fact.</em>[2]  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>From the first definition, the sticking point may be the “vast body of evidence”. However, the official story has 0 scientific evidence, <a href="http://skeptopathy.com/wp/?p=334">as we will soon see</a>, and the TCD theory has considerable evidence.  </p>

<hr/>

<p>The weird thing is Dr. Astaneh-Asl&#39;s account places an 8 hour timeframe on the eutectic action that caused the severe steel wastage. Severe corrosion, deep mystery, <a href="https://www.wpi.edu/News/Transformations/2002Spring/steel.html">novel phenomenon</a>, evaporation, very unusual event, etc.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>One piece Dr. Astaneh-Asl saw was a charred horizontal I-beam from 7 World Trade Center, a 47-story skyscraper that collapsed from fire eight hours after the attacks. The beam, so named because its cross-section looks like a capital I, had clearly endured searing temperatures. Parts of the flat top of the I, once five-eighths of an inch thick, had vaporized.  </p>

<p>Less clear was whether the beam had been charred after the collapse, as it lay in the pile of burning rubble, or whether it had been engulfed in the fire that led to the building&#39;s collapse, which would provide a more telling clue.  </p>

<p>The answer lay in the beam&#39;s twisted shape. As weight pushed down, the center portion had buckled outward.  </p>

<p>&#39;&#39;This tells me it buckled while it was attached to the column,&#39;&#39; not as it fell, Dr. Astaneh-Asl said, adding, &#39;&#39;It had burned first, then buckled.&#39;&#39;  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/02/science/scarred-steel-holds-clues-and-remedies.html">Source</a>   </p>

<hr/>

<p>For example, valuable information could come from analysis of the blackened steel from the floors engulfed in flame after the airplane collisions. Steel flanges had been reduced from an inch thick to paper thin, Astaneh said. <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/news/berkeleyan/2001/10/03_grou.html">Source</a>  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>We need to know how the &quot;eutectic action&quot; happened that&#39;s why astaneh&#39;s timeframe is important. <a href="http://www.internationalskeptics.com/forums/vbimghost.php?do=displayimg&amp;amp;imgid=27691">Can you imagine 15.8mm of steel gone in 8</a> days or an inch of steel turning to a &quot;<a href="https://www.wpi.edu/News/Transformations/2002Spring/steel.html">razor sharpness</a>&quot; in just 2 weeks?   </p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/ijKf1J6">Dr. Astaneh-Asl findings are similar to FEMA&#39;s</a> &quot;It is also possible that the phenomenon started prior to collapse and accelerated the weakening of the steel structure. A detailed study into the mechanisms of this phenomenon is needed to determine what risk, if any, is presented to existing steel structures exposed to severe and long-burning fires. </p>

<p>But, unlike the OP is trying to fool you into believing, that &quot;problem&quot; doesn&#39;t have anything to do with the content of the report. It is statutorily inadmissible. OP&#39;s assertion that it is inadmissible because it fails Daubert is unfounded and an intentional misdirection.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Given the magnitude of 9/11 and all that has followed in its wake, it is not unreasonable to inquire whether we, the people of the United States of America, indeed the people of the World, are entitled to a Daubert hearing on the question of the cause(s) of the destruction of WTC 1, 2 and 7 on September 11, 2001.  </p>

<p>In this paper the reader has been provided with a reasonably sufficient introduction to the question of the cause(s) of the destruction of WTC 1, 2 and 7, as well as citations to several sources and documents addressing both sides of the debate on this subject. It is beyond the scope of this paper to go into greater detail. Indeed, it is incumbent upon the readers who are so inclined to dig deeper into the available information and conduct their own research with respect to investigating the facts, proved or alleged, and the science and technology involved in connection with the question of the cause(s) of the destruction of WTC 1, 2 and 7 on September 11, 2001. I will endeavor, however so briefly here, to apply the Daubert factors to the expert opinions on this important issue.  </p>

<p>The official theory as pronounced by NIST (and FEMA) has been scrutinized by numerous architects, engineers, physicists, demolition, and explosive experts. While some members of the scientific community have chosen to accept the official theory, there is no general acceptance of the theory in the scientific community. Indeed, the official theory has been rejected by many qualified experts who have reviewed and scrutinized the NIST reports and the data that NIST has made available.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha. I&#39;m not going to read that until you recognize that it is irrelevant to report&#39;s inadmissibility. Maybe what you&#39;re quoting is correct. Maybe it demonstrates the problems of the NIST report. I&#39;m open to that possibility and open to reading it. But not until you recognize that the paper&#39;s critique of the report can&#39;t be relevant to its inadmissibility. Admit that and we can move forward from there.</p>
