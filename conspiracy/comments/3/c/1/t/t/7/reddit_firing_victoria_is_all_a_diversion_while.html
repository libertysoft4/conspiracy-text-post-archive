    <div class="md"><p>...and our oh-so-cliche&#39;d Stars&amp;Bars Boy, about whom interesting questions are circulating elsewhere:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some interesting facts about the shooter, according to all mainstream sources:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>22 years old, living in his car, grew up dirt poor, sometimes in a rural trailer park, sometimes in a majority black area.</p></li>
<li><p>On serious, hard drugs for at least the last year, arrested twice.</p></li>
<li><p>A facebook page was set up two years ago, hardly used, <em>half of the Facebook friends are Blacks he went to high school with</em>. He has no other typical online presence – no twitter, no chats. Just a Facebook page that has no use expect for posing as a “White Supremacist” in the recent past.</p></li>
<li><p>All of a sudden, poses with two flag patches on his jacket – Rhodesia and South Africa – that he could not have purchased in South Carolina and would have a damn hard time ordering online – especially since he almost certainly didn’t have a credit card. Where the HELL does some poor white trash druggie from South Carolina even get access to such novelty patches? How does a poor white trash trailer park boy in South Carolina even LEARN about these historical regimes that were overthrown before he was even born?</p></li>
<li><p>A few months ago, his parents and friends say he started talking about “racial groups” he was “getting involved” in. (<em>COUGH</em> FBI <em>COUGH</em>) How does this NOT fit in the typical FBI entrapment category that has been discussed in very mainstream media – BBC, NYT, WSJ – for <em>years</em> now?</p></li>
<li><p>Hillary Clinton was campaining a HALF MILE AWAY ONE HOUR before the shooting? If this was ANY other country, we would call this a “warning” or a “botched assassination” of a political figure. Of course, the STATE SENATOR that he shot – the target – was a huge Hillary supporter.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This is just shades of RFK, isn’t it? I want to find who was handling him – you know, the “FBI informant” that had “infiltrated” the “radical racist” scene … in rural South Carolina trailer parks.</p>
