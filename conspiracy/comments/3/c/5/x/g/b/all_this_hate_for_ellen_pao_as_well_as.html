    <div class="md"><p>That makes a lot of sense. Especially since she is just the interim CEO, as in temporarily filling the position as long as she&#39;s willing to toe the line.  </p>

<p>Given her background, Bachelor&#39;s degree in Electrical Engineering from Princeton, Doctorate in Law and MBA in Business from Harvard, she is obviously a very determined individual.  If the board of directors tells her that they want to make reddit more profitable, that is going to be her sole focus.  She doesn&#39;t give a fuck about the community, the mods or the integrity of the site.  </p>

<p>This whole shit storm after firing Victoria really could not have happened any better for the Board of Directors because now they have the perfect out.  It&#39;s not like Pao can sue them for gender discrimination when the entire site is blaming her for the fiasco.  The petition to get her fired already has 100,000 signatures. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty much exactly what I was thinking; It&#39;s not exactly news that reddit has never been profitable. They&#39;ve had plenty of investors over the years, and it&#39;s been a <em>lot</em> of years. There <em>has</em> to be a fire under <em>someone&#39;s</em> ass to get this site making money asap.</p>

<p>That would require making lots of changes, very quickly. Lots of unpopular changes. Enough to cripple the userbase. It&#39;s a tricky, potential suicide mission.</p>

<p>In fact, IIRC, I think I read somewhere that said exactly that she was brought in to make reddit &quot;profitable&quot;. This might just be what they ment the whole time.</p>

<p>This guy is absolutely going to pitch something expensive. Question being
- should we plan to counter with some trade, partnership, etc type of

<p>In general, probably not worth it. In my opion Reddit is not near the
upper crust of the social sharing, RSS feed, user-generated links sites
and certainly not compatible with paid content. If you look at their
topics, it&#39;s actually quite lowbrow. We&#39;d probably get better mileage out
of StumbleUpon or Digg, if it&#39;s something we&#39;re thinking about pursuing.</p>

<p>From the article:</p>

<p>Recently, more and more evidence has emerged that there is something very wrong going on with Reddit. While the concept is brilliant, the corporation and its administration are corrupt. In early 2012, a hacker named Jeremy Hammond leaked (through Wikileaks) the emails of the private intelligence firm Stratfor, and his cache included emails showing that the Chairman of Reddit (Alexis Ohanian) had met with the CEO of Stratfor (George Friedman), and sought to work with Stratfor as a consultant.[1] Hammond is currently in jail, having been served a ten-year long sentence for having hacked and leaked these emails.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not even. That post still implies that Ellen Pao is orchestrating some grand scheme to rip-off the reddit shareholders. I&#39;m saying that the reddit <em>Board of Directors</em> is the puppet-master to an unwitting (or very much <em>already</em> paid-off/willing scapegoat, who owes a lot of money and could use the gig) to instigate changes they&#39;ve wanted to make all along but otherwise couldn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Two slightly different takes on the same situation, but then again, we&#39;re all speculating, so I refuse to say anyone is <em>more</em> right than the other. I think we can all agree this smells fishy, either way.</p>

<p>Two people in different places getting the same idea and making a similar observation at the same time, independently of one another, is not an unheard of phenomenon.</p>

<p>Does it? That wasn&#39;t my intention. I agree with you 100%. Though I didn&#39;t mention the Board of Directors. </p>
