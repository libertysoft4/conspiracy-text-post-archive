<blockquote>
<p>Have you noticed that events have begun to accelerate? Over the past few weeks, things have officially started to get very weird.  </p>

<p>Chinese stocks are crashing, the Greek debt crisis is spiraling out of control, the New York Stock Exchange was down for about four hours on Wednesday thanks to a “technical glitch”, and global politicians have been acting very strangely. After several years of relative calm, could it be possible that the second half of 2015 will usher in a time of chaos and confusion on a worldwide scale?  </p>

<p>Personally, I have never been more concerned about a period of time as I am about the last six months of 2015. And if I am right, what we have seen so far is just the tip of the iceberg. The following are 10 very strange things that have happened in just the past few weeks…</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li><p>On Wednesday, the New York Stock Exchange, United Airlines and the Wall Street Journal were all taken down by unexpected “technical glitches“. Authorities are assuring us that hackers were not responsible for any of this.</p></li>
<li><p>In China, a full-blown stock market crash is unfolding. The Shanghai Composite Index has plummeted more than 30 percent in less than a month, and the Chinese version of the NASDAQ has dropped by more than 40 percent. The amount of “paper wealth” that has been lost in China is 15 times greater than the GDP of Greece.</p></li>
<li><p>Just the other day, hackers were able to hack into a German surface-to-air missile battery: &quot;Well, this is absolutely terrifying. According to The Local, hackers attacked a German Patriot surface-to-air missile battery, like the one shown above, stationed along the Turkish-Syria border. The cyber attack caused the battery to carryout “unexplained” orders. It’s believed that cyber attackers managed to exploit the Patriot battery in two different ways. The first exploit was through the Sensor-Shooter-Interoperability, which controls interactions between the actual, physical missile launcher and its control system, while the other was on the guidance chip. These weaknesses could have allowed the hackers to steal data or, more worryingly, actually take control of the battery.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Earlier this week, Barack Obama told reports that “we’re speeding up training of ISIL forces“…</p></li>
<li><p>Just a few days ago, the U.S. Mint announced that they were sold out of American Eagle silver coins on the exact same day that the price of silver hit a new low for 2015. How does that make any sense?</p></li>
<li><p>On June 30th, an unexpected blood moon was seen over a significant portion of the United States. The following is an excerpt from a recent article by Caiden Cowger: &quot;On June 30, 2015, a surprise blood moon appeared in the sky, that was only seen in the United States. According to the National Weather Service, large wildfires in Canada have been burning. Due to extremely high winds, smoke from these fires have traveled into the United States. According to NBC-Chattanooga, “the smoke should remain in the higher atmosphere and not affect air quality, it gives the moon and sun a rosy glow.</p></li>
<li><p>Even though NASA recently stated that they know of “no asteroid or comet currently on a collision course with Earth” and that “no large object is likely to strike the Earth any time in the next several hundred years“,  NASA has teamed up with the National Nuclear Security Administration to try to figure out a way to use nuclear weapons to destroy asteroids that are threatening our planet. If there is no threat, why spend so much time and energy on this?</p></li>
<li><p>A couple of weeks ago, we learned that Barack Obama has issued 19 “secret directives“. What is Obama planning, and why won’t he let the general public know about it?</p></li>
<li><p>This week, Pope Francis called for the creation of “a new economic and ecological world order where the goods of the Earth are shared by everyone, not just exploited by the rich.”  So exactly what would such a “world order” look like?</p></li>
<li><p>The Greek people just overwhelmingly voted to reject austerity, so EU officials have responded by giving the Greek government a one week deadline to come to an agreement that will include even more austerity for the Greek people. If the Greek government does not submit, EU officials are threatening them with bankruptcy, the collapse of their banking system and expulsion from the euro.</p></li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>Things promise to only get stranger from here. One week from today, on July 15th, a massive military exercise known as “Jade Helm” begins. More than 1,000 members of the U.S. military will be taking part in drills that will be conducted in the states of Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, California, Mississippi and Florida.</p>

<p>Then in September comes the end of the Shemitah year, the fourth blood moon of this tetrad, the launch of a radical new sustainable development agenda at the United Nations that is being endorsed by the Pope, and a vote on a UN Security Council resolution that would formally establish a Palestinian state.</p>

<p>And that is just the stuff that we know about.</p>

<p>So what do you think we should expect from the rest of this year?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fear, fear, and more fear. That&#39;s the name of the game. Of course at any moment anything could happen. You could die right now. Accept that, the inevitability of your own death. We are living in the time of the Kali Yuga, the lifting of the veil. Things might get scary. In fact, things will be very bad and this will eventually all blow up in our faces. Have no fear, for then the cycle begins again and we&#39;re back in paradise (Eden). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Greece and China are not surprises. Greece has been in free fall since 07. China&#39;s entire economy is based on exporting. Economies like these tend to crash. Hackers getting into a missile system is unnerving but bring light to the issue of secure systems. China hacked a US data base of employee info in January. Hacking happens. The glitch on Wall Street is suspicious because the wsj was hacked as well, not to mention American air lines. I&#39;ll give you that. But overall it&#39;s a news cycle..... Stuff happens. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agree on Greece, but be honest, how is it coincidence that in the last 3-4 months, massive and very powerful systems all got &quot;glitches &quot; at the same time?  It&#39;s not paranoid to wonder how safe we are if hackers can take over the transport systems (United), the backbone of the U.S. Economy (nyse), and one of the biggest parts of military defense (Patriot missiles).  Which occurred a few months after the hacking of the U.S. Personnel database, and a few months before that millions of people had their data stolen by hackers attacking the IRS.  </p>

<p>There are two possible explanations for this.  </p>

<p>First, we might actually be in a cyberwar with China.  NATO and China are the only ones affected thus far, and criminal organizations would be as likely to hit the Nikkei or other stock markets as they would be to hit the U.S. And China.  They&#39;d also be likely to hit other companies.  Sure the IRS has a lot of data, but so do large employers, and for that matter other countries.  (Russia has a big population for example, or South Korea, or Japan). </p>

<p>Second, I think there&#39;s a possibility that in the next few months there&#39;s going to be a big push on securing the Internet against attacks like this, and it will be aimed at those who dissent and those who spread information about how computers work.  Anonymous will be a big target as well as any other group that talks bout Internet freedom and exposes spying.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is what ZetaTalk said about the nexus between the NYSE glitch, the Chinese stock market crash &amp; United Airlines downtime: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&amp;nbsp; China is considered the world’s strongest economy at present, and its newly affluent citizens are doing more than buying cars and electronics. They are playing the stock market. In a country not familiar with capitalist gambling markets, China is still establishing controls. Its recent bursting bubble, wherein their stock market lost 30% within weeks, is a learning curve and not a fatal blow. Such market crashes are familiar to the West, from the 1929 crash to the more recent 2008 housing bubble crash on Wall Street. Was the shutdown of the NYSE a reaction, a protective maneuver known as Plunge Protection? Yes, despite claims that it was a computer crash. Panic trading is stopped in these instances.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp; What raised eyebrows was the apparent nexus in timing for other outages. United Airlines halted all flights earlier in the day for two hours, claiming a computer glitch. The Wall Street Journal crashed, simultaneous to the NYSE down time, reportedly due to the rush of the public to read the latest during the market closures. If a DDOS attack can disable a server, certainly a rush by the public can create delayed service, but is there more to this story? Amid all this was a tweet from Anonymous suggesting on July 7 that Wall Street will have a bad day on July 8, which then resulted.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp; Though seemingly separate issues, these well publicized outages not only have a common nexus, they were caused by the same hand. As we stated after the elite caused Obama to miss his October 20, 2014 date for the announcement, the <a href="http://www.zetatalk.com/ning/08no2014.htm">Council of Worlds has gone to war with the elite</a>.  We have stated that this war has been won and the announcement will now proceed, but given the nature of the Service-to-Self individuals prevalent among the elite, they are being given some last minute reminders on just WHO won this war. They should not expect to recoup or rally. The <a href="http://www.zetatalk.com/ning/04jy2015.htm">sudden demise of a Space X shuttle to the ISS</a>, after many successes, was such a reminder to Elon Musk and his cronies.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp; China is a partner during Obama’s announcement, but the China stock market was clearly headed for an adjustment, and thus the timing of the Council’s warming. Speculators in China will be reined in sharply by China, unlike the criminals on Wall Street who were never really disciplined after the Wall Street crash in 2008. Margin traders in China, hedge funds on Wall Street, deceptive derivative packages by mortgage bundlers, and the hallmark symbols of these crimes the NYSE and the Wall Street Journal. Anonymous of course is a human working closely with the Council on these matters.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp; What did the down time for United Airlines have to do with this sharp warning to Wall Street and wealthy speculators worldwide? The United downtime occurred the same day, but earlier in the day. The elite, who dearly want to prevent Obama from making his announcement, rely on modern day electronics to enhance their wealth. Beyond being able to make transactions around the world in a blink of an eye, the symbol of their elevation to the status of gods, in their eyes, is air travel. They can cross borders, evade prosecution, go to pleasant climates, and no one can stop them. Please note, this can be stopped with a wink of the Council’s eye. </p>
