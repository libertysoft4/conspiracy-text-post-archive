<p>So, what &quot;evidence&quot; do you have for your claim that &quot;Practically The Entire World Knows That Israel Did It&quot;? My evidence is a poll of over 16,000 people in 17 different countries, in which 93% of respondents said Israel was <strong>not</strong> responsible. Got anything? Or will we just get your usual response of personal attacks?</p>

<p>Since reading comprehension is apparently not your strong point. here are the percentage of respondents in each country outside the Middle East who answered &quot;Israel&quot; when asked, &quot;Who do you think is responsible for the 9/11 attack?&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li>Germany: 1%</li>
<li>France: 0%</li>
<li>Britain: 1%</li>
<li>Russia: 2%</li>
<li>Italy: 1%</li>
<li>Ukraine: 1%</li>
<li>Turkey: 3%</li>
<li>Kenya: 3%</li>
<li>Nigeria: 2%</li>
<li>Taiwan: 0%</li>
<li>South Korea: 1%</li>

<li>Mexico: 0%</li>

<p>Clearly the truth is not your strong point, since only sample groups are used in opinion polls. Not only have you not sourced your information, so we can see how biased and/or incorrect it is, but you actually seem to be saying that someone has asked every single person in Kenya whether they think 9/11 was an Israeli false flag attack.</p>

<p>Clearly this is not true and clearly you are a buffoon for implying it.</p>

<p>EDIT: As I suspected, your distortion of the facts is incredible.</p>

<p><strong>On September 11, 2006, MSNBC Question of the Day poll asked, “Do you believe any 9/11 conspiracy theories that indicate the U.S. government was involved?” An astounding 58 percent answered, “Yes, I believe there is evidence,”</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://thewebmatrix.net/disclosure/2001.html">http://thewebmatrix.net/disclosure/2001.html</a></p>

<p>This is the same US government which was effectively being told what to do by Israel, through its neo-Conservative US think tanks and sponsored lobbyists.</p>

<p>You&#39;re just a liar, and I hate liars. You claim one percent of Germans think Israel was involved? Well, that&#39;s a sharp contrast to the 90 percent of Germans polled by the Werner Institute who all say the US government is lying about what happened. </p>

<p>Liar.</p>

<p>Well, if they are lying then it means someone other than al Qaeda did it, and since Mossad were the ones who got caught disco dancing in celebration when the attacks occurred, they are the most probable culprits, wouldn&#39;t you say? Especially given that they were also covered in explosives residue and that they lied extensively in an attempt to deceive the FBI.</p>

<p>Actually, no, I wouldn&#39;t make that fallacious logical leap: Saudi Arabia likely has a lot more to answer for. It wasn&#39;t Israelis [and I&#39;ll set aside the dubious accuracy of your hyperbolic claims] who hijacked the planes on 9/11 and flew them into buildings.

<p>But the Saudi Arabians didn&#39;t have an intelligence unit which was caught dancing in celebration, with explosives residue all over their clothes. And yet, to confirm, you say it is the Israeli connection which is the &quot;fallacious leap&quot;? Not the Saudi Arabian connection? The one you have failed to provide any evidential support even exists.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>who hijacked the planes on 9/11 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nobody knows who hijacked the planes, or if they were even hijacked, so your knowledge of this subject appears to be absolutely fucking zero. At least six of the men named came forward to say their identities had been stolen. Just what type of drug are you injecting into your idiot shill neck, that you think the people about to pull off the biggest terrorist attack in history would be doing so using their real identities? Aside from this idiotic and baseless assumption, you also make the assumption that you were told the truth about the planes being hijacked. Airlines expect hijacks and have a specific protocol to follow in the event of one, which makes it all the more strange that none of the pilots flying the 9/11 planes reported any hijack.</p>

<p>If that were true I&#39;m quite sure you&#39;d share it instead of scrabbling desperately once again to move the subject away from Israeli involvement.

<p>He also denied all involvement in 9/11 and offered to stand trial to prove his innocence. There&#39;s just literally no evidence connecting him to 9/11, and the evidence which does exist, which points in the opposite direction, is ignored by the media.</p>

<p>The entire system was exploited on 9/11. The Zionists who conducted the attacks knew that the media would not launch its own investigation, but would simply ask its sources in government for the story. </p>

<p>And as for bin Laden, he would never be given a trial because that creates the possibility that he would be found innocent, whereas without a trial that possibility would not exist in the minds of the American people.</p>

<p>Enron was one of the companies interested in the super-pipeline idea through Afghanistan. If you read Nafeez Ahmed&#39;s research, it looks like American relations only soured with the Taliban after they began demanding more money for the deal. According to Ahmed, the top Texas oil magnates flew the Mullahs out to America in about 1996-1997, wined and dined them, took them to baseball games and movies, all with the aim of buttering them up for the deal. When they wouldn&#39;t play ball, the Americans started to get nasty and use threats.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it&#39;s quite astounding, isn&#39;t it? That even the opponents of this system will barely whisper that 9-11 was an Israeli / CIA op. The Zionist / Jewish control of mainstream media and Hollywood is unquestionable. Recently, thanks to some of the brave people on this very sub, I have finally looked into the events of WW2, and found the &quot;heroism&quot; of the Allies to be very....  lacking. From the firebombing of Dresden, to the Betrayal of the Cossacks, to the millions worked to death in Stalin&#39;s Gulags (that never seem to get any memorial museums, or reparations), it would really seem that the only narrative that the Allies were &quot;the good guys&quot; in WW2 rests on the gas chambers, and the idea that Hitler was trying to take over the world. </p>

<p>I now realize upon close examination and the research of braver men than I, that both of these claims probably do not hold up to scrutiny. To be honest, I barely need any proof other than the fact that questioning the historical events of something that occurred 70 years ago will land you in actual prison today, in multiple Western countries. But of course there is more proof than that, from the Transfer Agreement to the Shrunken Heads, to the claim of &quot;6 million&quot; to the technical impossibility of the burning of the corpses, to the post war retrofitting of the gas chambers to make them look a lot more gas chamber-ey, I&#39;ve learned if it looks like shit, smells like shit, then it is shit. </p>

<p>Western culture is shit. Our grandiose moral values have been reduced to Cultural Marxism, mass immigration flooding our formerly great countries, debt piling up so high it threatens to flood us all under its weight at any moment, all traditional values and respect for human decency being thrown into the trash and all the while being told that &quot;this is progress&quot;. </p>

<p>How do people not see this? It is so frustrating, to see this illusion of what we call &quot;media&quot;, nothing more than weaponized propaganda, shoved down our throats, and for what? Nothing good will come of this for anyone. I&#39;m beginning to believe there truly is a holy war going on on this planet, the forces of light against darkness. Darkness is winning currently, but look at how hard it has to fight to do so. The light is starting to crack through, every little nook and cranny is starting to shine. </p>

<p>Three things cannot be hidden for long; the sun; the moon; and the truth.</p>

<p>Yes, it&#39;s quite astounding, isn&#39;t it? That even the opponents of this system will barely whisper that 9-11 was an Israeli / CIA op. The Zionist / Jewish control of mainstream media and Hollywood is unquestionable. Recently, thanks to some of the brave people on this very sub, I have finally looked into the events of WW2, and found the &quot;heroism&quot; of the Allies to be very.... lacking.</p>

<p>I genuinely have not got the courage to find out how deep the rabbit hole goes. I see the scope of the lies and deceit by Zionist Jews after 9/11, but I daren&#39;t look back any further in case my entire notion of 20th century history is a lie.</p>

<p>Omg, this <em>inspired</em> me bro. It sounded like the President&#39;s speech in Independence Day! Lol. Seriously though, with you all the way. In many ways, I think 9/11 might have been the beginning of the end for the Zionist assault on reality. They were extremely cocky, they botched it, and a lot of people have started pulling on that ball of string as a result.</p>

<p>As any half-decent investigator knows, the FIRST question to ask in any such incident is WHO BENEFITS?</p>

<p>New York Times - September 12, 2001</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/12/us/day-terror-israelis-spilled-blood-seen-bond-that-draws-2-nations-closer.html">A DAY OF TERROR: THE ISRAELIS; Spilled Blood Is Seen as Bond That Draws 2 Nations Closer</a></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>JERUSALEM, Sept. 11— Israeli officials and most Palestinian leaders condemned the attack on the United States today. <strong>But Israelis also took cold comfort in concluding that Americans would now share more of their fears</strong>, while some Palestinians rejoiced at the same thought. </p>

<p>There were declarations of sympathy for the victims from both Israelis and Palestinians, as well as anxious telephone calls to friends and relatives in the United States. But politics is never far behind any human reaction here. <strong>And each side in this conflict saw in today&#39;s attack confirmation of its view of the bond of the United States and Israel -- that the two nations fought, and now suffered, together.</strong> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>[...]</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Asked tonight what the attack meant for relations between the United States and Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, the former prime minister, replied, &#39;&#39;It&#39;s very good.&#39;&#39;</strong> Then he edited himself: <strong>&#39;&#39;Well, not very good, but it will generate immediate sympathy.&#39;&#39;</strong> He predicted that the attack would &#39;<strong>&#39;strengthen the bond between our two peoples, because we&#39;ve experienced terror over so many decades, but the United States has now experienced a massive hemorrhaging of terror.&#39;&#39;</strong> </p>

<p>In an appearance late tonight, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon repeatedly placed Israel on the same ground as the United States, calling the assault an attack on &#39;&#39;our common values&#39;&#39; and declaring, &#39;&#39;I believe together we can defeat these forces of evil.&#39;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fast-forward six years - Haaretz, April 16, 2008</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/report-netanyahu-says-9-11-terror-attacks-good-for-israel-1.244044">Report: Netanyahu says 9/11 terror attacks good for Israel</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>According to Ma&#39;ariv, Netanyahu said Israel is &#39;benefiting from attack&#39; as it &#39;swung American public opinion.&#39;</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Israeli newspaper Ma&#39;ariv on Wednesday reported that Likud leader Benjamin <strong>Netanyahu told an audience at Bar Ilan university that the September 11, 2001 terror attacks had been beneficial for Israel</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;We are benefiting from one thing, and that is the attack on the Twin Towers and Pentagon, and the American struggle in Iraq,&quot;</strong> Ma&#39;ariv quoted the former prime minister as saying. He reportedly added that <strong>these events &quot;swung American public opinion in our favor.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Netanyahu reportedly made the comments during a conference at Bar-Ilan University on the division of Jerusalem as part of a peace deal with the Palestinians. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It sure is nice to know that SOMEONE benefited from the 9-11 attacks. God knows that America, Afghanistan and Iraq sure as hell didn&#39;t benefit.</p>

<p>You deliberately refuse to acknowledge or investigate the evidence specifically so that you can call it &quot;speculation&quot;. It is perfectly clear who the perpetrators of this crime were. They were caught red-handed, they were covered in explosives residue, and they were seen &quot;dancing with joy&quot; when the attacks took place.</p>

<p>It has been 14 years since that fateful day. I didn&#39;t &quot;conclude&quot; anything &quot;immediately&quot;. There are mountains of circumstantial evidence not cited above that support Israel&#39;s participation in the planning and execution of the events of 9-11, and given the benefit of hindsight, we can see that the attack on Iraq in particular was only the beginning - Iraq was the &quot;first domino&quot; to fall in what was to be an ongoing reshaping of the entire political structure of the Middle East - again, to Israel&#39;s benefit.</p>

<p>Israel has never been officially investigated for the crime so you seem to be saying that Israel can&#39;t be guilty because it hasn&#39;t been investigated. Yes?</p>

<p>The &quot;argument&quot; isn&#39;t missing the fact that a Mossad team were caught &quot;dancing with joy&quot;, filming the attacks, covered in explosives residue, and it doesn&#39;t change that at least one witness has them filming at Doric Towers before the first plane hit.</p>

<p>You have reason to believe Israel was behind the attacks because of the &quot;dancing with joy&quot; video posted on youtube after 9/11. So from this you draw the conclusion that it must have been them, because who else would do such a thing. Now over a decade later turns out there <em>still are no facts to support this</em>, or at least none that you can show me. So when <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> posts a thread on this subject claiming it as fact, when there are none to be found within the content, I can only come to two conclusions.</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
</tbody></table>

<p>A) It&#39;s another bullshit conspiracy theory.</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
</tbody></table>

<p>B) There&#39;s probably much more to the story that is quite possible we will never find out the facts to in our lifetime. Only a small group of people know.</p>

<p>So unfortunately you will not be able to convince me beyond a reasonable doubt that it was Israel who was behind the 9/11 attacks without any real content to back it up, and quite frankly its taking the easy way out to do so. </p>

<p>Lie. You have already made this claim and have already been told that they were covered in explosives residue, that they arrived with filming equipment before the first plane struck, and that they repeatedly failed lie detector tests.</p>

<p>This is where our communications often break down. We show you evidence. You deny it&#39;s evidence.</p>

<p>But if I may trouble you before you leave us forever, how exactly is a Mossad team being caught dancing in celebration not evidence that Mossad was involved? Do you think that dancing in celebration was a normal reaction to have to the attacks? Do you also think it was normal that these men failed lie detector tests and were covered in explosives residue?</p>

<p>How do you feel about at least one witness testifying they arrived at Doric Towers and began setting up filming equipment before the attacks even occurred?</p>

<p>Nah, not evidence. Right?</p>
