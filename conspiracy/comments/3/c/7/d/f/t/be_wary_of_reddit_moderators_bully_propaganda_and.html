        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is maximally unpopular to say right now but put some skeptical thought into the situation. Consider the following, if only hypothetically:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Nearly all evidence and narrative that has been presented to Redditors has been one sided and force fed to us by the moderators</p></li>
<li><p>Key parts of the story are poorly filled in -- and it doesn&#39;t matter to anyone. We know more about the demands of the moderators than we know about their complaints. Who is Victoria, and why was she so important? She is the straw that broke the camel&#39;s back, or something, but what is the substance of the complaints? At least we know they <strong>aren&#39;t</strong> doing this because some AMA went wrong and they have mud on their face. What have the admins done that usurps so much power from mods? There are a few things, if you dig for them, but they don&#39;t seem important to most people commenting. Kneejerk emotional reactions are driving almost all Redditors to support them. The bully tactic of &quot;blacking out&quot; of subreddits to push the mod&#39;s side is what convinced most people rather than the thin, hardly explained story.</p></li>
<li><p>Take note of the veneer of a grassroots, popular movement -- but only after the bully propaganda campaign convinced everyone to the mods&#39; side. This is reminiscent of SOPA blackout storytelling where a massive popular revolt &quot;saved the internet.&quot; Astroturfing is the number one tool used by internet monopolies in their various conflicts with copyrighters and telecoms who want to charge them for posting their property and using their bandwidth. Internet Monopolies such as Google etc &quot;blacked out&quot; their web site, fixing the minds of millions in an instant that SOPA is a violation of something like &quot;human rights&quot; and not a battleground between big internet powers and content owners.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Be skeptical.</em> I don&#39;t have any answers or even any real theories. I am even sympathetic to the moderators, even though their propaganda tactics and the results are nauseating to me, even convincing most of the usually skeptical and openminded <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> community. </p>

<p>How does this major outrage possibly contact other unarticulated power conflicts between admins and moderators?  What are some possible ulterior motives behind the moderators&#39; demands, and where do they align or more importantly <em>not align</em> with the interest of average redditors?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know what you&#39;re suggesting but I think it&#39;s a bit off. The thing with Victoria is that she had originally been behind the scenes but as time went on and AMAs picked up and became a huge deal, many people doing the AMAs would say something about Victoria being there to help them, etc. This gradually peaked the interest of people reading the AMAs and Victoria&#39;s character was realized and the folks of reddit of reddit came to love her. The leukemia guy is a different story. He never really worked for reddit (or did short term) but kept getting sick. Reddit did help him out with insurance and they held his position for him but he kept getting sick. They made a business decision to give up on him, eventually. That May or may not be &quot;right&quot;, but that&#39;s not the point. The point is that the people of reddit never interacted with this guy in the way that they got to with Victoria. We all got to slowly find out about her and hear things here and there until we wanted her to do an AMA herself. So from all that evolved an actual relationship between an integral employee of reddit and Reddit&#39;s users. That&#39;s why everyone flipped when she suddenly got fired without any forewarning or apparent reason. It sucks that the Dacvac was eventually let go but he simply did not have the same impact on reddit that Victoria did and THAT is why people are not responding the same. It has nothing to do with one being a boy and one being a girl.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I, for one, would be more pissed because of Dacvac (I don&#39;t let it phase me, though). Reddit can be happy they&#39;re in the USA because here in Europe they&#39;d be hit with a huge ass fine as stuff like that is perfectly illegal here.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I have seen other admins far more active than her, and I&#39;m sure most users wouldn&#39;t shed tears for them either (not talking about the asshat admins but the normal ones).</p>

<p>I can understand, though. She&#39;s indeed attractive, and might have fallen for her myself a few years back, now I simply know better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It has to do with chromosomes and hormones.. I mean, just take twenty minutes to look it up online and read about how it works. Of course I&#39;m not actually suggesting that you are a purse-carrying, dress and make-up wearing girl in the womb. I&#39;m just pointing out that the human embryo is technically female <strong>by default</strong> until the point in development when the genes determine how it will grow. Some times this process doesn&#39;t go as it should and you end up with transgendered individuals (female psychologically and emotionally but physically a male). Ultimately, there is not much of a difference between a male and a female, as a penis and testes are very much like the clitoris and ovaries, and both males and females have nipples, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not how it works. If you have a claim, you have to provide proof, not demand the other party to &quot;look it up&quot;.</p>

<p>That being said, it&#39;s genes not hormones that determine one&#39;s sex. (I don&#39;t give a shit about &quot;gender&quot;, it&#39;s a &quot;social construct&quot; anyway.) When hormones act out you get feminine men and masculine women. Homosexuality is a disorder amongst many species (methinks population control mechanism) and transgenderism is a <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2015/06/03/wsj-promotes-op-ed-claiming-transgender-identity-is-a-mental-disorder/">mental illness</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Moderators are not demanding pay, although they are providing labor for administration as janitors or managers of communities. Their demands don&#39;t even properly align with their own interests.</p>

<p>Reddit is able to make such incredibly high profits, like uber or other similar labor exploiting schemes veiled in utopian promises of &quot;freedom&quot; and &quot;technology&quot;, on the backs of workers who aren&#39;t considered workers (except in california, maybe). The self-subjugating mentality moderators must maintain to keep doing work for free has to be taken into account. </p>

<p>There are other threads framing the blackout as a backroom administrator plot that will purposefully backfire and push forward rapid changes, and I don&#39;t know about that, but it shows the nature of this all as an especially hamhanded kind of reactionary freakout, like when Facebook changes the layout and everyone has a pity party for a few days. </p>

<p>Maybe too simple of an explanation, but in my mind it makes sense. Pathetic moderators who don&#39;t comprehend their own subjugation under Reddit&#39;s paid staff are making the kind of pathetic demands under pathetic grievances because they&#39;re so brainwashed by the politics they see as enabling utopian communities that will &quot;save the world&quot; rather than what it is: Purified exploitation of their labor.</p>
