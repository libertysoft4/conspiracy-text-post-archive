        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In my opinion, The Matrix films provide the best metaphor our society has for understanding why organized evil and oppression are allowed to exist, and so I will use it for this purpose. While my interpretation isn&#39;t the only possible one, I believe it to be valid,comprehensive, and most importantly, illustrative of the message I am trying to convey. So let&#39;s begin by discussing what the Matrix is not. The Matrix is not the physical world. As far as I&#39;m concerned, the physical world is actually real and is in fact governed ceaselessly by the laws of physics. Conversely, the Matrix is also not the Internet, despite what many seem to believe. The Matrix spans and transcends both these worlds. It has existed since the dawn of civilization, and it will continue to exist until its collapse. </p>

<p>So then, what is it? Well, that&#39;s complicated. Much like in the movie, it&#39;s nearly impossible to convey the size and scope of the Matrix to someone who doesn&#39;t already see it for what it is. However, unlike the movie, I believe it is an ethical imperative to try to convey it in a literal sense, even to those who are so dependent upon the Matrix that they would fight to protect it. At worst, they won&#39;t understand or believe and will continue on about their business. In a sense, I believe Cypher was right to resent Morpheus for what he did, because Morpheus is the social structure that subordinates Humanity to its will. It is the 
machinery of society that exists solely to perpetuate itself, its influence, and its power independent of any human need. It insulates us from each other and ourselves through deception, and essentially transforms us into servile engines of economic and political output (power). The machines that live off this power are institutions: large corporations, governments, schools, religious institutions, and even non-profit orgs. </p>

<p>Every institution will reach a point in its existence where its primary function becomes self-preservation and perpetuation, instead of serving human need. At this point it becomes a machine of the Matrix. For example, when they become machines, governments cease to serve people and instead seek to extend their power over them; corporations prioritize increasing shareholder value over producing quality products or otherwise serving the public good; schools view students as a means and not an end; religious organizations equate membership with salvation (and actively oppose other teachings and even independent practice); and non-profits and charities spend more budget on fund raising activity than on their original focus. Inevitably all large institutions eventually become machines. They become too big for Humanity. In addition to the independent self-perpetuating machines that write most of our paychecks, the Matrix has several major cooperative and more actively sinister groups of machines subsisting off of its power and directly contributing to the structure of the Matrix itself. These groups are the Military Industrial Complex, the Political Industrial Complex, the Prison Industrial Complex, the Surveillance Industrial Complex, the Media Industrial Complex, the Academic Industrial Complex, the Agricultural Industrial Complex, the Medical Industrial Complex and the major religious organizations (not to be confused with actual religions, many religious organizations have abandoned the underlying principles of the religions they claim to represent). All machines in these groups either actively oppress humanity, or enable the oppression to persist. It is through their combined efforts that the Matrix takes on some of its more distasteful qualities.</p>

<p><strong>Original Post ends here..............................................................more below</strong> </p>

<p>Resistance is a mental state. The Matrix is designed to make it easy to accept what it tells you, and to make it hard to filter the Truth from the lies. Resisting the Matrix requires understanding its operating principles and assumptions, rejecting them, and helping others to do the same. The Matrix is fascist, the Matrix is deceptive, and the Matrix is bureaucracy. The Matrix is essentially the 
rule of the institution over the individual, and in it, the rights of the individual are subordinate to the rights of the institution. Individuals have to believe (or at least not actively oppose the idea) that large corporations have the right to protect their profits above all else, and thus dictate policy and law. They have 
to believe that this law is just, moral, and seemingly based upon reason. Or, they have to feel unaffected by the law on an individual level. They have to accept the program, and be satisfied with the rewards given for doing so. They have to do their jobs, pay their taxes, and be content with their salary (at least to the point where their salary and the stability it provides are appealing enough to deter risking leaving the Matrix). Rejecting these beliefs is the first step in resisting the Matrix. Furthermore, people must be insulated from the creative process. They have to forget that they are able to produce craft as individuals independent of large institutions, and they must feel entirely dependent upon the system to provide them with what they need. It is mostly through the violation of this principle that many who work with computers come to free themselves, or at least come to see the Matrix for what it is. </p>

<p>Despite being products of the Matrix (for the most part), computers and the Internet enable humans to create individual works on a global scale: independent media, self-publishing, Free Open Source Software, computer music, computer art and graphics, and so on. Computers also enable independent people to communicate and build human-serving social structures outside of the Matrix. However, note that computers aren&#39;t the only means of accomplishing this, and this time period isn&#39;t the first one of Exodus. In the 1960s, for example, people departed from the Matrix en-mass and independently created art, culture, and music, largely catalyzed by psychedelic drugs. Unfortunately, much of this structure collapsed due to a number of reasons, the main one being the hasty, ill-considered and unsustainable manner of its construction and the subsequent institutional and legal backlash. Miraculously, however, many of the core ideas have persisted. </p>

<p>It would seem that the present catalyst is a combination of the Internet
and again psychedelics. Both of these phenomena provide a way of disconnecting yourself from the programmed reality and assumptions of the Matrix and taking your perceptions into your own hands. However, your &quot;perception&quot; is nothing but your individual dream that you have created as you have gone through life. There is the dream of the society that has been passed down generation after generation and instilled into your mind by your parents, friends, schools, and institutions. And then there is your individual dream. Each step of the way in your life you have lived subjectively, and depending upon how and where you grew up, who you hung around with, and the habits you formed, you created your little dream. Your &quot;theory&quot; on life while you stay completely unconscious of this. Everything that you think is &quot;you&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;me&quot;, and everything you believe that you identify with is simply not you. It is not the truth. It is part of the giant web of individual dreams that everyone is in the clutches of on our planet. This is one of the main reasons why this world is the way it is, why it is so chaotic. You will scorn anyone who does not dream 
what you dream of, and someone will do the same to you. It is impossible for us to live the same individual dream because we cannot know everything about each other down to our core. It is a constant fog that grows bigger and bigger and more dense as each day passes. It is your ego and it is my ego. The dream is not real. If we want to even begin to understand what it means to exist as a human being on this planet and evolve, this truth must be learned and it is just the beginning. Somewhere along the way, the entities that have been running the show figured out how the ego works, and they have been doing a damn good job at distracting us from trying to find a way out of our dreams and the dream of society. Psychedelics are simply a tool, but one of many to truly explore and expand your consciousness. However, whether it be psychedelic substances or meditation, it is not the ultimate answer. It is simply showing you the door, but it is your choice whether or not you want to enter into the other side.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This logic goes hand in hand with Sense8, also by the Wachowski brothers. If we were all connected telepathically, then the Matrix could not exist. The Matrix needs gaps for it to occupy and blur, much like a fungus, or a film over your eyes. Otherwise it would be powerless to affect what you see. Hence why the sensates are hunted - there is no bigger threat to the Matrix than beings that can bypass it and feel other being&#39;s emotions and environments directly. Wars would become impossible. Greed would become much more difficult, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we would agree on many things. </p>

<p>To set aside the Matrix metaphor for a moment, there are two directly opposing ways of seeing the world, and they each have their own truths and their own problems. We can view the world as a planet with very limited resources, and we can interpret that personally in different ways: for some people, this means we need to fight our way to the top of the heap and grab as many resources as possible for ourselves; for others, we need to recycle, reuse and be very cautious how we use these resources, knowing that they are limited.</p>

<p>Another way of looking at the world is that much of the scarcity is political in nature, not necessarily a natural scarcity: for example, if we compare traditional agriculture to aquaponics, we see that aquaponics uses 99% less water because instead of pouring water onto the ground and letting it all flow away, we are simply recycling and reusing the same water over and over again. Whereas traditional agriculture may result in one crop and harvest a year, and hydroponics increases growth rate enough to yield two harvests a year, aquaponics yields three harvests a year. If we convert a hydroponic greenhouse to aquaponics, we get an additional harvest of vegetables, and on top of that copious quantities of fish protein. Additionally, instead of consuming oil-based or chemical based fertilizers, the greenhouse becomes a PRODUCER of natural organic fertilizer.</p>

<p>Suddenly, from this point of view, we do not see a world of scarcity; we see a bountiful world, filled with fresh food and vegetables for anyone with a balcony that isn&#39;t facing North. Ideally at the same time we understand that this bounty comes from reusing and recycling, and from understanding that where traditional agriculture as a monoculture (Western understanding of agriculture) limits us, aquaponics/polyculture, using the output of one system (aquaculture results in a lot of fish poo) as the input to another system (fish poo becomes fertilizer for hydroponics) we are taking advantage of the natural energy flows which exist in the natural systems; we are simply optimizing the natural order of things and getting better results.</p>

<p>My intent here is to share this simple idea: by encouraging food security education into schools, we may impart the nuanced view of a world of plenty instead of artificial scarcity, combined with the in-depth understanding that we need to reuse, recycle, and take care of this little blue marble so that there is a future for us here. Children are sponges; being around aquaponics they can absorb an understanding of the natural cycle of life and death; an understanding of the web of the environment, the life support systems of earth; how to plant and harvest vegetables; how to grow, catch, clean and filet a fish; and even an understanding of the fundamentals of plumbing and electrical /solar systems. </p>

<p>When we introduce such things as community greenhouses to an impoverished neighbourhood in western society, we may encounter unexpected problems: the poor may be accustomed to a diet of macaroni, hamburger meat, and potatoes, such that they do not know how to cook and prepare a fish or a cabbage  in such a way as to be both nutritious and delicious. In spite of the challenges, I believe that it&#39;s important to try, and that influencing young minds in such a way will help them to see the Matrix for what it is, and that there are ways to create value and find meaning in life in spite of the net result of the MIC, the govt, the media etc.</p>

<p>Sometimes I ramble; I hope I have expressed myself well enough to give some idea of ways for all of us to de-Matrix and help others grow,</p>

<p>Onwards and upwards,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well said. My .02 would be the matrix is the physical reality we operate within. A seemingly flawless, religiously, mathematically/scientifically explainable reality that meets the needs of the five senses. As humanity continues our evolutionary path, our awareness rising, we begin to realize our reality is not so physical, we realize we are not alone and can finally break from our known beliefs and structures to break the matrix. Ending the physical machines control (military industrial complex, governments etc) and begin to fight off the next enemy of our species.... And that would be the beings behind the matrixs construction and earn true freedom of consciousness. Cool stuff, of course I&#39;m making shit up lol but I often have thought about the fact we could be living in a fake reality being broadcasted over what there truly is to see. </p>
