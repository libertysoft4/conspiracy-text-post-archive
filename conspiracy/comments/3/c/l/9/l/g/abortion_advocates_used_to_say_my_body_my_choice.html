<p>That thing you said about bullshit from admittedly false reports, being misguided, and refusing to see anything but the same skewed bullshit applies to you as well, like it or not.</p>

<p>It applies to me too. This is why I usually prefer to make up my own mind about an issue after I&#39;ve satisfied my own intellectual curiosity regarding sides and arguments. Any viewpoint is worth entertaining, if at least for just a new perspective. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes!</p>

<p>(Cue the downvotes. I&#39;m not under the delusion that reddit is a haven for free speech, so this post is an experiment.)</p>

<p>Of course medical decisions should be a choice.  Sometimes those choices are difficult, especially when it comes to vaccines and abortion.</p>

<p>The most important thing about choices is that they be well-informed, guided by conscience and backed by objective facts.</p>

<p>The source of said facts must always be considered.  Complete transparency is a must. Health topics have astronomical financial interests tied to them, that weave throughout an economy.</p>

<p>Are vaccines a good thing? In theory, of course.  And it seems obvious.  But do the facts behind the modern vaccine industry support this theory?  </p>

<p>Would vaccine preventable diseases have remained on the decline had vaccinations not become the norm?</p>

<p>Are current vaccine formulations effective against the strains of the diseases they are meant to eradicate?  </p>

<p>Are vaccines produced ethically, without the sacrifice of human fetal cells, and not tainted with substances that can cause harm to the person&#39;s health?</p>

<p>How do the health risks of actually contracting that disease compare to any possible adverse reaction to that vaccination?</p>

<p>Most of all, why is it wrong to ask any of these questions?  </p>

<p>Vaccines should be a choice, and always an informed choice.  If complete vaccine compliance is the goal, you need the best possible product for the job, not the most lucrative one. </p>

<p>Honest, objective sources show that the current state of vaccination industry is driven by financial gain rather than support of the public&#39;s health.</p>

<p>And that is a tragedy, for everyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well put!</p>

<p>I&#39;ll say it again: My spouse had a Leading Edge Neurologist back in the &#39;80&#39;s that said a Live Vaccine from our Child could harm His <em>patient</em> and we had to <em>decide or consider</em> delayed Medical <em>CONSENT</em> to not IMMUNIZE our off-spring to protect his client!</p>

<p>We chose to <em>medically delay</em>. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a long ass story and IMHO the delay had not one damned thing to do with our daughters near death experience some weeks later and her consequent Immune Supressed System 20 years after the fact.</p>

<p>There used to be Dime Marches to help cure the epidemic, thousands would march. It was a national crisis.</p>

<p>It was defeated through vaccinations. We would probably still suffer Polio if not for vaccinations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s absolutely by the manufacturers themselves.  That great revolving door with &quot;regulators&quot; helps only the manufacturers.  Double blind studies have NEVER occurred for one perfectly clear reason.  The claims aren&#39;t supportable with evidence.  Of they were, they would be.  First in animals, then in humans.  They don&#39;t stand on their own merits.  This game is entirely rigged by the manufacturers.  The vaccines courts are an absolute joke.  They use every trick in the book to maximize profits and remove liability for damages caused by their products.  No accountability to anyone but their shareholders.</p>

<p>They can&#39;t prove they work.  They can&#39;t prove they are safe.  And if and when you&#39;re injured by their products, good luck.  They accept no responsibility for that.</p>

<p>It&#39;s nice that you still believe big pharma is out to help you, and is working in your best interest.  For a healthier population.  Yet after being caught countless times conspiring to harm you, hiding studies that prove the drugs and vaccines they&#39;re hawking are ineffective at best, and at worst, highly damaging and/or fatal.  But this time they really aren&#39;t doing that to you.  Trust us.  We can&#39;t back it up with evidence, but this time we&#39;ve got it right.  Seriously.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On February 22, 2011 the U.S. Supreme Court shielded drug companies from all liability for harm caused by vaccines mandated by government when companies could have made a safer vaccine.</p>

<p>From now on, drug companies selling vaccines in America will not be held accountable by a jury of our peers in a court of law if those vaccines brain damage us but could have been made less toxic.</p>

<p>If you get paralyzed by a flu shot or your child has a serious reaction to a vaccine required for school and becomes learning disabled, epileptic, autistic, asthmatic, diabetic or mentally retarded, you are on your own.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You have zero legal recourse in this perverted system, but really, just keep trusting the same people who have willingly and maliciously harmed you time and time again.</p>

<p>The burden of proof lies with the manufacturers (and you) claiming they are perfectly safe.  The fuck outta here with this big pharma talking points bullshit...</p>

<p>99.9% of the scientific community, every high impact factor medical journal is all lying because reasons.</p>

<p>Big pharma just loves their low profit margin vaccines they&#39;re forced by the government to make.</p>

<p>You can point out issues within the scientific community and issues with money maybe corrupting a few studies, but these studies are always called out/never in real journals.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t reason with people that have no rational reasoning ability, the paranoia is just too strong.</p>

<p><strong>“The case against science is straightforward: much of the scientific literature, perhaps half, may simply be untrue.

<p>The cover of the AAP breastfeeding guide featured the name and logo of Ross Products, the company who make infant formula containing over 50% sugar, any doctor or medical organization that recommends a diet of corn syrup, soy protein, sugar and cheap oils to an infant should be arrested for malpractice.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s more to <em>cell shedding</em>, that an Neurologist back in the mid &#39;80&#39;s was <em>protecting his patient from</em> due to live Vaccines! </p>

<p>This Neurologist, back in the early mid-eighties was PROTECTING his patient from a Live Vaccine, from an outside source and the Doctor applied the brakes to inform his patient.</p>

<p>This Neurologist knew that injecting his immune compromised patient with heavy doses of steroids could harm his patient if said patient was <strong>EXPOSED</strong> to LIVE Vaccines!</p>

<p>Who knew that shit in the &#39;80&#39;s?</p>

<p>JFYI: The placebo <em>Designer</em> drugs for MS run $3 to $6 Grand per month. </p>

<p>I want Science and Solutions. </p>

<p>Third child was in utero during this entire event. It is my Theory that the Virus Jumped The Third Rail.</p>

<p>Beat my daughter, in your quest! I&#39;m sure your Master of Chemistry and reddit will serve you well. </p>

<p>It is, indeed my Theory that the Virus incubated and jumped the Blood Brain Barrier and or the placenta.</p>

<p>Our third child was born in Hospital and <em>whisked</em> away and was shot, probed and poked, unlike our first two.</p>

<p>Yes. Before you insult me further: Correlation does not imply causation. I get it.</p>

<p>Short answer: First, it was not as rampant as the owned media and big pharma would have you believe.  Second, it was reclassified as &quot;not-polio&quot; as countless individuals were injected with SV40 laden &quot;vaccines.&quot; Causing a massive spike in cancers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unbeknownst to most doctors, the polio-vaccine history involves a massive public health service makeover during an era when a live, deadly strain of poliovirus infected the Salk polio vaccines, and paralyzed hundreds of children and their contacts.  These were the vaccines that were supposedly responsible for the decline in polio from 1955 to 1961! But there is a more sinister reason for the “decline” in polio during those years; in 1955, a very creative re-definition of poliovirus infections was invented, to “cover” the fact that many cases of ”polio” paralysis had no poliovirus in their systems at all. While this protected the reputation of the Salk vaccine, it muddied the waters of history in a big way.</p>

<p>Even during the peak epidemics, unifactorial poliovirus infection, resulting in long-term paralysis, was a low-incidence disease[2] that was falsely represented as a rampant and violent crippler by Basil O’Connor’s “March Of Dimes” advertising campaigns. At the same time as Basil O’Connor was pulling in 45 million dollars a year to fund the Salk vaccine development, scientists started to realize that other viruses like Coxsackie, echo and enteroviruses, could also cause polio.  They also discussed the fact that lead, arsenic, DDT, and other commonly-used neurotoxins, could identically mimic the lesions of polio. During the great epidemics in the United States, the pathology called polio was reversed by alternative medical doctors who attested to great success, using detoxification procedures available at the time – yet they were categorically ignored[3].</p>

<p>Now it is admitted in the medical literature that other viruses can cause polio, yet few people on the street have any idea.</p>

<p>Prior to 1954, the following undoubtedly hid behind the name “poliomyelitis”: Transverse Myelitis, viral or “aseptic” meningitis, Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS)- (what Franklin Delano Roosevelt had)[4], Chinese Paralytic syndrome, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, epidemic cholera, cholera morbus, spinal meningitis, spinal apoplexy, inhibitory palsy, intermittent fever, famine fever, worm fever, bilious remittent fever, ergotism, post-polio syndrome, acute flaccid paralysis(AFP).</p>

<p>Included under the umbrella term “Acute Flaccid Paralysis” are Poliomyelitis, Transverse Myelitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, enteroviral encephalopathy, traumatic neuritis, Reye’s syndrome etc.</p>

<p>Smallpox was the very first vaccine, implemented prior to the establishment of a vast profit-driven pharmaceutical industry.</p>

<p>I think the idea of vaccinations is a good one. I think the idea of a profit-driven pharmaceutical industry is a bad one. I think the latter hiding behind the former is a recipe for disaster.</p>

<p>Also, it&#39;s actually the cowpox vaccine. The nominally functional premise was that getting vaccinated against cowpox (which the human immune system, in some subjects, could more easily establish immunity to) helped build/establish immunity to smallpox.</p>

Like everywhere, profit driven industry can achieve great things (for the consumer or the technological advancements) or can turn into a great trust leading to danger for the consumer (and a complete lack of advancements).<br/>
Concerning big pharma, the idea is to be careful about lobbying and pressure on independent research. And we should focus on this, rather than rejecting all vaccines.</p>

<p>How so? Vaccinated people spread disease in the same way unvaccinated people do. If a vaccinated person comes into contact with a disease and has it on their hands, they will most likely spread it more than an unvaccinated person because the vaccinated person doesn&#39;t get sick or show symptoms, therefore spreading the disease further. Whereas an unvaccinated kid will come into contact with the disease, get sick, and be removed from public. </p>

<p>LOL. Being vaccinated does not <em>keep you from coming into contact</em> with the disease. What are you talking about? If that were true, how did so many vaccinated people get measles at Disneyland?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Remember smallpox? I wonder how that was eradicated...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yea. How was that eradicated? By giving a small amount of the disease to someone right? So then their own immune system would build up a tolerance to that disease and then be able to reject the other, would you agree?</p>

<p>Did you know that less than 50% of the vaccines of the 70 on the CA vaccines schedule work in that way? The others don&#39;t work like that. They use cell cultures like WI-38 (from aborted babies I shit you not), and just inject those cells into your body. The smallpox/polio &quot;live virus&quot; style of vaccination is not the norm and is not even being used to make new vaccines. But I&#39;m sure you knew that being a vax freak right?</p>

<p>Google WI-38 right now if you don&#39;t believe it. </p>

<p>The way in which polio was eradicated is not even the same way vaccines are made today. Cell cultures like WI-38 have replaced &quot;live virus&quot; vaccines.</p>

<p>I said it&#39;s possible. Why? Because a vaccinated person can have the disease on their person and carry it around and get other people sick in the exact same way an unvaccinated person can. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not true that a vaccinated person can have a virus on their body, say, if a sick person sneezed on them? Do vaccines somehow kill a virus that on the outside of your skin? Can you explain how it&#39;s done? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How does it &quot;threaten&quot; them?...under this logic, if you walk into a hospital, you are voluntarily entering a &quot;threatening&quot; situation because of the possibility of getting a superbug that has been incubated and created in a hospital environment. Do you consider the emergency room a threat then? A visit to hospital to see a sick friend would be considered a life threating event.</p>

<p>So under this logic nobody has the right to their own bodies or their children&#39;s bodies but the state, and the state will choose for you how you are to take care of yourself and your children...fuck that noise. The state can barely patrol a highway to keep it safe never mind get involved in the complex immmune systems of the human body.</p>

<p>If you didn&#39;t have the abortion, would a baby come into existence or not? The POINT of having an abortion is to stop a child from existing that would otherwise be born if you hadn&#39;t intervened. <a href="http://www.christiangallery.com/dismem.jpg">This is an abortion</a>. And even though I think abortions are disgusting, I believe that a woman should have the right to have one if she so chooses.</p>

<p>When I beat off, my sperm doesn&#39;t grow into a baby if I don&#39;t make sure to get rid of it via a surgical procedure. To equate the two is a joke.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the logical end game. Overpopulation of the planet has been a major concern since the 1970s. We can&#39;t just keep growing into infinity. How do we maintain a reasonably sustainable global population? Reduce birth rates or increase death rates. Sterilization is generally viewed as the more &quot;acceptable&quot; route as opposed to gunning us all down in our sleep.</p>

<p>My spouse, with an Immune Compromised system, under heavy steroids for a severe MS <em>Flair Up</em> was Advised and Consulted because our Child was due for Immunization!</p>

<p>The Doctor was, all the way back then <em>Protecting</em> his patient!</p>

<p>We were granted a Medical <em>delay</em>.</p>

<p>It was a huge process.</p>

<p>She suffered horribly only hours after the shot. Now has, herself, an Compromised Immune System and her younger sibling has Full Blown Juvenile On-Set MS!</p>

<p>She will be a Neurologist! </p>

<p>THIS WAS IN mid 1980&#39;s! </p>

<p>Good luck with your HYPE!</p>

You have been gamed by the industry if you believe polio was &quot;eliminated&quot; by the vaccine. You cannot comprehend the extent of this ruse without the knowledge in this video.</p>
