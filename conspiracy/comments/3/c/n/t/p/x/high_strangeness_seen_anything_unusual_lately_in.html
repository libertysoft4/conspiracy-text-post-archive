<hr/>

<p>My area is normally (as in consistently for 20+ years) experiencing the occasional big-ass storm, with periodic bits of crystal clear skies and <em>significantly</em> (maybe as much as 10 deg F) hotter temperatures during this time of year.</p>

<p>However what I have noticed over the course of the last couple months (back to April) is that we only have a few (1-3 days) breaks between this odd really low overcast that seems to be basically constant. It seems strangely fast for clouds (think thick smoke playing at 33% normal speed, rough guess is the overcast moves at ~35 mph) and has this <em>weird</em> rain thing that happens for <em>days at a time</em>. </p>

<p>It&#39;s akin to like a &quot;misting&quot; in that the raindrops that fall seem unusually small. Maybe like as small as they could be and still be conceptualized as raindrops. As I said, this happens for <em>days</em>. Happening right outside. I&#39;ve never experienced anything like it. (as consistent as it has been, the overcast has been fairly consistent for the last couple months)</p>

<p>I just thought I&#39;d relate primarily because it sparked a thought that it was strange I would notice something odd about something I&#39;ve honestly never given much thought about.</p>

<p>You guess seen anything odd lately that&#39;s <em>not</em> on some telescreen?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting post. Glad people are talking about it.</p>

<p>Boston here. Have definitely noticed a delay in seasonal change. Like another poster it seems to be just about two months behind.
We have not had that many humid days, summer has been mild thus far. Is that strange? Nah. However it may feel strange because the winter was so harsh and it seems as if we had a mini spring and thus far a mild summer.</p>

<p>What I do find prominent is the general sense of eeriness. Like a knowing that something is just not right. Feels like there is a significant amount of electrical energy all around, but the spark to it has not been lit. It&#39;s heavy without the humidity.</p>

<p>edit: not to get all new agey. But I feel that the mind hive, the collective conscious is absolutely spiking right now and has been for awhile.</p>

All of my life, July equates to sweating your ass off but for the last two months I&#39;m not sure the temperature has reached 85° for more than two consecutive days.

And I know it sounds stupid... But there is a permeable sense of eeriness in the air. I&#39;ve been checking every news source I know of constantly waiting for an explanation for my mysterious apprehension. There is certainly a shadowy mutiny afoot... Glad I am not alone...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Came here to say this. I&#39;ve lived in the Chicago-land area for my entire life and work outside about 10 miles south of the city and this weather is nothing I have ever seen before.</p>

<p>Usually by now I would have been to the beach or had multiple days to go home and jump in the pool. So far, especially in July, it has been below 70 degrees and unending rain. It&#39;s normal for the weather here to change drastically but this odd mist/ late night thunder storm combo is really starting to weird me out...</p>

<p>Edit: also, on one day when it was hot and humid I almost felt suffocated. Given the Gary steel mills do make the air pretty shitty, it&#39;s never been unbearable. Me and my coworkers were all sitting down catching our breath doing a normal day&#39;s work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>but, it&#39;s been raining for all of eternity in NS =)</p>

<p>Ontario, Canada here: it&#39;s been raining an awful lot, wouldn&#39;t be surprised if June set some sort of record. The rain seems to have changed somehow: it often starts and stops extremely abruptly, as if someone is opening and closing a tap. It&#39;s been a pretty cool summer this year, my understanding is that weather that is normally further north, is flowing more south this year due to wind patterns. I was so concerned about the changes over the past two years that I actually had some landscaping done to make sure the land slopes away from the house, put a french drain in to improve drainage, and put some paving stones in. The idea is to be a little proactive about climate change, to reduce damage if there are floods, even though I&#39;m not in a flood prone area.</p>

<p>On a side note, I&#39;ve kept aquariums for many years, and played with aquaponics. The bacteria in these systems have ways of modifying the environment to keep the system balanced; if the system tilts too far out of whack without correction, things suddenly change very quickly: the system goes critical and everything dies. I don&#39;t know enough to evaluate all of the studies and information on this topic, but my gut tells me that the system has been tilted for some time; the earth has absorbed as much tilt as it can and we have past the point of no return. I expect the changes to come exponentially faster,</p>

<p>I&#39;ve actually still got some of these frozen in my freezer. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been living in Denver for 30 years.  We usually get 355+ days a year where it&#39;s sunny most of the day.  We never get rain that lasts all day and night.  Most of May was like that.  We broke all our May rainfall records.  </p>

<p>This week has been really weird.  We got this thick heavy foggy cloudy misty rain.  The kinda that Seattle gets.  We never get that kinda weather here.  Not at least the last 30 years I have been living here.</p>

<p>The winds have changed too.  Normally the weather rains from west to east air flow.  Rain come from over the Rockies onto Denver.  This year when it rains, the rain clouds race west <em>toward</em> the mountains.  It&#39;s like the jet stream switched.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read most of the PDF you posted, which is a thought experiment prepared by the USAF on ways that weather control could be used to aid military warfare against sophisticated enemies.</p>

<p>This has nothing to do with climate change, which is the human driven change in global weather patterns due to the increased levels of greenhouse gasses, most notably carbon dioxide and methane. These gasses are a byproduct of our industrial revolution and modern farming. What part of this is so difficult to understand? </p>

Think about it, being a Conspiracy thread user as well.
Katrina, Dallas, California, on and on.</p>

<p>An interesting idea of warfare would be to create natural disasters (the public would not know otherwise) that would probably be difficult to be proved to be malicious and from where it would originate. Use this to destroy an area, which would cause that country to repair. Do this over and over, draining the economy of that country as a precursor to further warfare techniques.</p>

<p>As a lover of games like Command and Conquer, and Supreme Commander (old PC RTS games if you are unfamiliar) I would always covertly go after the economy and supply chain first.</p>

<p>I think ideas like this are interesting, horrifying, (as war is meant to be), but interesting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here in Northwest Kansas, there has been a hazy daze everywhere. I know the farmers are starting the wheat harvest now and there will be dust around in the country, but there has been a haze throughout all of the country-side and even in town. It&#39;s there/here when I wake up, stays everywhere throughout the day and is still there in the evening. I&#39;ve never seen anything like this, the haze is almost and blueish-gray/white. You can see the clouds and blue sky when you look directly above you, but when you look out towards the horizon or even a few hundred feet in front of you, it looks like there&#39;s a constant fog. It has been very dry like usual during this time of the year here in Kansas, so not humid at all</p>

<p>It&#39;s not the smoke from the Canada fires because it isn&#39;t reaching to this part of Kansas at all. It&#39;s very strange, I caught up with a friend and he &quot;thought he was going crazy&quot; because the &quot;sky didn&#39;t look right&quot; and was glad I brought it up.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the 7th, I could look directly at the sun through this haze at about 7:30-8:00 pm. The sun is still out and it&#39;s still usually hot at that time of day.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve gotten calls for moisture during this time and they&#39;ve all been turned to 0% moisture within hours before they said it was going to start raining. </p>

<p>EDIT: The interesting thing I find is when El Nino did come out and was being used as a Scapegoat that first year it was being explained as something that doesn&#39;t happen very frequently.   Now suddenly anytime the weather seems odd it is that or El Nina that caused it.   Strange how something that was not very frequent is available to conveniently explain the weather very frequently. </p>

<p>EDIT 2: I think El Nina should actually read La Nina.   Sorry about no tilde over the N, not quite sure how to make that happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Came here to say this. I&#39;ve lived in the Chicago-land area for my entire life and work outside about 10 miles south of the city and this weather is nothing I have ever seen before.</p>

<p>Usually by now I would have been to the beach or had multiple days to go home and jump in the pool. So far, especially in July, it has been below 70 degrees and unending rain. It&#39;s normal for the weather here to change drastically but this odd mist/ late night thunder storm combo is really starting to weird me out...</p>

<p>Edit: also, on one day when it was hot and humid I almost felt suffocated. Given the Gary steel mills do make the air pretty shitty, it&#39;s never been unbearable. Me and my coworkers were all sitting down catching our breath doing a normal day&#39;s work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Consider that Raytheon, large military contracting company, owns weather modification patents as well as most weather forecasting. So they will not be broadcasting the geoengineering nightmare being wrought upon our earth via atmospheric aerosol injection, haarp, etc on tv news. Monsanto also has a stake in the weather modification world. Lots or cheery faces in that room, eh? </p>

I replied not to attack but to show it was possible that it could be a weapon and that (if used) history would show that a cover story would be needed to keep the populace calm and productive as to not hurt the economy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no way of knowing if this is taking place of course and don&#39;t intend to try to prove anything, but it is something that interests me, much like any spy novel would.
Think about it, being a Conspiracy thread user as well.
Katrina, Dallas, California, on and on.</p>

<p>An interesting idea of warfare would be to create natural disasters (the public would not know otherwise) that would probably be difficult to be proved to be malicious and from where it would originate. Use this to destroy an area, which would cause that country to repair. Do this over and over, draining the economy of that country as a precursor to further warfare techniques.</p>

<p>As a lover of games like Command and Conquer, and Supreme Commander (old PC RTS games if you are unfamiliar) I would always covertly go after the economy and supply chain first.</p>

<p>I think ideas like this are interesting, horrifying, (as war is meant to be), but interesting.</p>
