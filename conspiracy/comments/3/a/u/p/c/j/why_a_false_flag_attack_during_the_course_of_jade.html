        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">65</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2015-06-23 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/blackphoenixx.html">blackphoenixx</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So at this point I assume that every user (and lurker) on this sub is familiar with Jade Helm 15. If not then check out this <a href="http://cdn5.freedomoutpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/BrCoComm021015ArmySpecialOpsCommand.pdf">PDF</a> summary , its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jade_Helm_15_conspiracy_theories">wiki page</a>  and a brief overview of the <a href="http://modernsurvivalblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/jade-helm-15-map.jpg">states involved</a>  (although Colorado has been recently <a href="http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/local-news/colorado-dropped-from-multi-state-jade-helm-special-forces-exercise05082015">dropped</a> from this list).</p>

<p>There have been a lot of theories regarding impending martial law. However not a lot of people have focused on the possibility of a false flag attack happening. I believe that sometime during the course of JH 15, a “terrorist” attack will occur that will be even bigger than the Boston Marathon bombing. It will be an attack carried out in the name of ISIS, or a lone wolf acting on behalf of ISIS. This might be a stretch but I think this attack will rival 9/11 in terms of causalities and media coverage.</p>

<p>Before I continue, let’s look at the purpose of false flag events and recent examples. Wiki states that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>False flag describes covert operations designed to <strong>deceive</strong> in such a way that the operations appear as though they are being carried out by entities, groups, or nations other than those who actually planned and executed them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or as <a href="http://www.wanttoknow.info/falseflag">this</a> website puts it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“False flag terrorism” occurs when elements <strong>within a government stage</strong> a secret operation whereby government forces <strong>pretend to be a targeted enemy</strong> while attacking their <strong>own forces or people</strong>.The attack is then falsely blamed on the enemy in order to <strong>justify going to war</strong> against that enemy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Outcomes of FF operations have always been similar, this includes: heightened surveillance, the increased militarization of the police force, less privacy (because who knows, <strong>you</strong> might be a terrorist too if you voice dissenting opinions). FF operations have always benefited the government in question from the USA to the UK, Australia, France etc.</p>

<p>There are many telltale signs of false flag terrorism however I want to focus on a single one: <strong>the running of drills shortly before or during the attack</strong>. What is the purpose of corresponding drills? This website explains:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Terror or public safety drills are conducted prior to and during the false-flag event. This <strong>draws manpower away</strong> from response readiness for the real attack and <strong>causes confusion</strong>. It also allows the opportunity for the drill to GO LIVE at the last moment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So then, how many times were drills “coincidentally” being conducted at the same time of a terror attack? One of many examples include: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_government_operations_and_exercises_on_September_11,_2001">9/11</a> , <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/7-7-mock-terror-drill-what-relationship-to-the-real-time-terror-attacks/821">7/7 London bombings</a>, <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/ci_21126462/real-life-shooting-imitates-training-exercise-at-parker">the Aurora shooting</a>, <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/um-coach-bomb-sniffing-dogs-spotters-on-roofs-before-boston-marathon-explosions/5331526">Boston Marathon Bombing</a> , <a href="http://www.ct.gov/demhs/ical/calendar.asp?date=12%2F14%2F2012&amp;amp;amp;amp;calendar_ID=0">Sandy Hook</a>  and the <a href="http://www.cryptogon.com/?p=24540">2011 Norway shooting</a>. What a coincidence. </p>

<p>Fast forward to present day. In March it was <a href="http://www.newschannel10.com/story/28603897/isis-releases-kill-list-seven-texas-cities-included">reported</a> that several states are increasing security due to ISIS threats. These states include <strong>Texas, Arizona, Nevada and New Mexico</strong>. Interestingly the JH exercises will be conducted in all these states. Texas is on top of this list with 7 cities being “targeted”.  ISIS already claimed responsibility for the cartoon contest attack.</p>

<p>In fact the US is <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-raises-security-level-at-military-bases-in-aftermath-of-isisinspired-texas-gun-attack-10237535.html">increasing security levels</a>  because of this very attack. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Pentagon announced on Friday that it was raising the security level for the first time in <strong>almost four years</strong> because of threats both within the US and abroad. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The US is now at Force Protection Bravo. An <a href="http://www.jointbasemdl.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-110501-004.pdf">US Air Force document</a> describes Bravo as when &quot;an increased and more predictable terrorist threat activity exists.&quot; One of the signs of a false flag operation is that the media hypes up the  the possibility of a terrorist attack weeks or months before the event.</p>

<p>What is interesting is that in San Antonio (Texas) the security levels have been increased due to “imminent threats”. San Antonio is also one of the cities in which the exercises will be conducted. Furthermore, it is the 7th most populated city in the USA and the 2nd most populated city in Texas. Due to its large population, this city is a great target as it increases the shock value if a false flag does happen.</p>

<p>What is also interesting is that ISIS released a statement saying that they will attack Texas again, claiming that the  <a href="http://shoebat.com/2015/05/06/isis-releases-this-statement-we-will-attack-texas-again-we-will-kill-christians-and-the-attack-will-be-far-worse/">“the attack will be far worse”</a>. Is it then a coincidence that Texas is most heavily affected by the exercise drills? I&#39;m not claiming that the attack will definitely happen in Texas but I am entertaining the thought.</p>

<p>What am I getting at? A false flag attack is imminent and we are merely being prepped at this stage. ISIS is the U.S. funded boogeyman (note that they are promising more violence this year as it is their <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/isis-expected-to-carry-out-more-violence-more-advances-more-attacks-as-one-year-anniversary-of-islamic-state-declaration-approaches-10277072.html">one year anniversary</a> ) who will claim responsibility once again. This will trigger a Problem-Reaction-Solution chain in which surveillance will increase even more drastically. The sad thing is that people will undoubtedly fall for this and hasten to give up their privacy just to feel ‘safer’ from ‘Moozlem’ terrorists. </p>

<p>Edit: the pattern of downvotes is interesting to say the least </p>

<p>Edit: FYI I initially linked the general wiki page of JH 15 however it no longer exists and only the conspiracy related wiki is up </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d rather discuss every potential possibility than sit around and not do it. It&#39;s not like we can predict things, but sure as shit will see the BS if something does.</p>

<p>This type of discourse is good for keeping our eyes open and practicing the critical thinking every person should posess.</p>

<p>Sure, nothing might happen. But its the thought that counts. It means every person drawn here by the subject matter is not gullible to bullshit, and that matters a lot, considering Nazi Germany. I&#39;ll even throw in the Gulf of Tonkin Incident and 9/11. At least one is a proven false flag, and I think it&#39;s great we have discussions like this, whether they end up being a reality or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve no problem with discussions, but drawing a connection between training exercises and real incidents seems misinformation at worst, and unhelpful at best. The problem is, no-one can ever tell me what distinguishes the courses that &quot;go live&quot; from the same courses that don&#39;t, or has correctly predicted it before an event. It has always been post-facto joining of dots. I imagine if South Carolina had been taking part in Jade Helm, this sub would be wetting its pants over the attack in Charleston. </p>

<p>With regard to the Gulf of Tonkin, when you say it was a &quot;proven false flag,&quot; are you saying it was a deliberately constructed event? Because I haven&#39;t seen any evidence proving it was a pre-planned act. Certainly, the government absolutely took advantage of it, and misrepresented what happened to further their own agenda: they did that on 9/11 too. But that doesn&#39;t mean they were responsible: twisting real events for your own goal is, sadly, political business as usual. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, considering the headlines of the past year, and the ominous &quot;warning&quot; from Cheney that there will be another &quot;event&quot; like 9/11, but worse &quot;this decade&quot;, i see this being pretty plausible. I have a sneaking feeling something bad will occur, the magnitude I&#39;m not sure, but something else tells me it will be bigger than a small bombing.</p>

<p>What I don&#39;t understand from your post, is when you say the media hypes a false flag weeks in advance. I remember Sandy hook being completely unforseen, as well as the Boston bombing, and even 9/11. I don&#39;t remember seeing any hype, but I may be wrong. That&#39;s the only part of your post that didn&#39;t make sense to me, everything else I totally comprehend and think it is a pretty strong possibility, considering drills/exercises during or before false flags.</p>

<p>Combining that with:</p>

<p>The ominous and illusory presence of &quot;ISIS&quot;
Cheney himself warning of another major attack
And Obama staying in office</p>

<p>Seems very plausible, almost creepy. I would not want to be living in that area right now.</p>

<p>A part of me almost wants something to happen, but only if its a &quot;hand in the cookie jar&quot; moment for our government, and the majority of patriots take arms and rebel against this nasty corrupt corportacracy we find ourselves in.</p>

<p>If something happens and were flocked even more than post 9/11, that would be incredibly sad. All the evidence is there, what we discussed here, but most Americans I fear will go with the herd and bring the darkest part of American history into this world.</p>

<p>I would love to see the people take back this country and put an end to the bullshit corruption. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Boston Bombing wasn&#39;t hyped  because there was no convenient scapegoat at that time- Bin Laden was already dead and there were no powerful Muslim terrorists groups threatening to wage war. And I think with 9/11 the media had an inkling that Al Qaeda was up to something (but I may be wrong). With regards to Sandy Hook, the media didn&#39;t necessarily hype it because it was all about pushing the anti gun agenda. 
Thanks for your response. </p>

<p>There is no credible evidence of any drill during the 2013 Boston Marathon. We have one guy - out of the hundreds of thousands present - saying he heard an announcement. That&#39;s about it. There was no &quot;drill&quot; in Sandy Hook. Sure, there were training exercises on 9/11. What do you think the military does all the time when they&#39;re not actually at war? There were, I&#39;m prepared to bet, also training exercises happening on 9/10, 9/9, 9/8, etc. </p>

<p>I&#39;d guess he mis-heard or mis-remembered something else, reported it, and the conspiracy mill rolled on from there. The more telling question is why none of the, literally, hundreds of thousands of others present, heard it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sandy Hook was definitely a drill by the way</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What makes you say that? The only evidence I&#39;ve seen is <a href="http://www.ct.gov/demhs/ical/eventDetail_page.asp?date_ID=CAC9C6C9CD83CDC9C7">this training class</a> - again, no practical component, so not a &quot;drill&quot; as I would define it, taking place somewhere else entirely in the state, and on multiple occasions that month.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the crux</p>

<blockquote>
<p>of course drills happen all the time</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and then</p>

<blockquote>
<p>drills always seem to coincide with high profile terror attacks</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The truth of the first statement EXPLAINS the second statement. When something takes place - your words - &quot;all the time&quot;, then it <strong>always will coincide</strong> with a terror attack, especially if your definition of what qualifies as &quot;drill&quot; is loose enough in definition and geography. It&#39;s like reading something meaningful in the fact that 100% of terror attacks happen on days that end in a Y. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen that one before. Odd, the way it conveniently fades out just as a subtitle appears, apparently stating the announcement is saying, &quot;They are playing you like a fiddle.&quot; I have repeatedly inquired about  the original version of this footage. No-one has ever provided it. Until then, yes: I absolutely question its validity.</p>

<p>The Boston Globe <a href="https://twitter.com/BostonGlobe/status/323886879453892609">did Tweet</a> &quot;There will be a controlled explosion opposite the library within one minute as part of bomb squad activities.&quot; However, check the timestamp on the Tweet (and adjust for timezone, if necessary): that was 3:53pm Eastern, more than an hour <strong>after</strong> the bombs went off at 2:49pm.

<p>I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s those who claim there was a drill in Boston that day who are grasping at straws. Not one of the bits of &quot;evidence&quot; they provide stands up to scrutiny. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can repeat the fact that there was a drill at Sandy Hook but you will try to find ways to refute this. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s because the evidence is feeble and worthless. Repeating a &quot;fact&quot; doesn&#39;t make it true. The &quot;drill&quot; reported at Sandy Hook was a classroom training exercise, which was only tangentially related to shootings. You can <a href="http://emilms.fema.gov/IS366/index.htm">see the course</a>, It&#39;s more concerned with natural disasters like Katrina. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Anyway, drills happen to occur near the place of the terror attack so how would you explain this? My point is: not all drills happen on a day of a terror attack but all terror attacks magically happen on drill days.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If your definitions are loose enough - and for the proponents of this claim, their definitions are very, very loose - there&#39;s a &quot;drill&quot; every day &quot;near&quot; everywhere. When, as with Aurora, your definition of &quot;drill&quot; includes the curriculum of an orthopedics institute, it&#39;s completely worthless. The sooner people realize this, the better. </p>
