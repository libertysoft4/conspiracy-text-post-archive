    <div class="md"><p>click bait to get people thinking (it works i think). pretty far out? i gave evidence based facts with a bible verse foretelling it? the bible is a history book with religion mixed and all archaeology proves the history(outside genesis and Jesus&#39;s miracles which ill agree cant be proven) in the bible is factual 
sorry for the rant </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All archeology proves the history? You&#39;ve gotta be kidding me. </p>

<p> from the bibile: 
Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran, his son&#39;s son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram&#39;s wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.</p>

<p>using the fundie approved biblical dating method of counting backwards adding the ages of the Patriarchs this means that Abraham lived around 1800bce
the chaldean dynasty (ur of the CHALDEES) didn&#39;t start until 800 years later</p>

<p>archaeology and geology has proved that there was never a worldwide flood.
archaeology and genetics has proved that we aren&#39;t made from the dust on the ground and women aren&#39;t engineered from a mans rib. We have real, actual evidence of neanderthals, and our genetic history. </p>

<p>the period that the bible claims the Israelites were in Egypt the country was actually ruled by the foreign country Hyksos, you would think they would notice, oh and of course, there would be no pharos giving orders.</p>

<p>exodus claims that the Israelites built Heliopolis during their stay, archaeology has proved it was there since predynastic times.</p>

<p>archaeology has proved that Hebrew didn&#39;t exist as a language when Moses was supposed to be using it to inscribe the ten commandments</p>

<p>these are just off the top of my head, the list is practically endless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Downpoaded the e book version of your link. The person who wrote that book just crafted a completely stupid, straw man version of evolution. He simply doesn&#39;t understand even the most BASIC of concepts of evolutionary science. I LITERALLY. Know Jr high students with a better grasp of biology, and basic tenants of evidence based science. </p>

<p>This fucking idiot actually thinks that the ENTIRE earth was flooded with water just a few thiusand years ago! Despite clear evidence to the contrary.  Ever wonder why only Christian &quot;geologists&quot; believe that shit?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your theory is wrong and stupid because the Google play app is not fucking summoning fucking satan.   I don&#39;t have a little sister, but I do have some crayons... perhaps I could use those to explain this to you on your level.</p>

<p>But you cannot disprove that satan is being fucking summoned by an app picture, any more than you can disprove writing the letter P gives energy to the mythical unicorn Gang that runs on happiness and rainbow farts. </p>

<p>It&#39;s up to YOU (the guy with the crazy claims) to back the claims uo with EVIDENCE. The only evidence of any kind you have is that the Google play symbol looks like a sigil used by occult people.   </p>

<p>You need to provide some kind of evidence that ANY of this shit even works.  I had the same conversation with the idiots saying putting two pencils in top of each other and chanting will summon a demon *facepalm.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That video is the brain of a stoner reading a high school math book so many flaws have you ever wandered why they don&#39;t use that &quot;evidence&quot; in debates or books trying to disprove evolution? well maybe its the fact that the ice age had the same amount of water as the flood and the shape of the earth hasn&#39;t always been the same so ya great comeback man way to use logic and show your real IQ</p>

<p>Second, just because countries of the world give Israel money doesn&#39;t mean anything. We gave tons of money to Hatti after the earthquake, Sri Lanka after the sunami, etc. The point is how you said it is incredibly anti-semetic. It&#39;s like if you were to walk into an inner city school and say: &quot;There&#39;s an awful lot of niggers in here,&quot; it may be true but you&#39;re still gonna get your ass beat for calling them niggers. </p>
