<p>We&#39;re talking about a state that still flies the Confederate flag over its state house. And if you&#39;ve ever spent any time in South Carolina, you know it&#39;s deeply racist. </p>

<p>But coming full circle, it&#39;s the church location that makes me think False Flag, because then you&#39;ve got the whole Satanist angle as well. </p>

<p>But I&#39;m not making any decisions yet. Let&#39;s see if they get this guy, and how much of a scapegoat he appears to be. </p>

<p>Thanks for tossing this out there, though. It&#39;s worth considering.</p>

<p>Interesting too, you you choose to lower-case all MKUltra but capitalize Satanism. </p>

<p>Please dismiss me as crazy &amp; leave me alone. I&#39;m not talking to you or people like you. Go back and waste a couple days writing about &quot;John Wick.&quot; That&#39;s far more important, especially now that they&#39;ve green-lighted &quot;John Wick 2.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All I know is this is a heinous crime. Having said that, labeling it a &quot;Hate Crime&quot; serves no purpose other than political pandering. 9 deaths is a death penalty case on its face. Hate crime labeling is only to enhance penalties. Unless someone knows how to enhance the penalty of a crime beyond death, I&#39;m all ears? Fanning flames of more civil unrest is all I see as a result of doing it. That Chief and Mayor are idiots! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For 9 deaths, you don&#39;t need &quot;racist bullshit&quot; to get JUSTICE. That is a death penalty case period. The only reason to drag this into the media and federal courts as an example of &quot;white racist evil America&quot; will only serve one purpose and that is pushing the propaganda that white America is racist, evil and the cancer of the world and gun control. No Justice purposes can be served that would enhance the penalty of death. So, I stand buy my analysis. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your analysis ignores the rules of evidence, which would otherwise exclude his racist history (assuming an asswipe who flies the Rhodesian and South African apartheid era flags on his shirt has one) as more prejudicial than probative on the homicide alone, at least prior to the penalty phase of a capital case.  Getting that evidence before the jury in the guilt/innocence phase would be useful, so indicting on a hate crime serves a purpose.  And a country that spawns shits like this has a lot to answer for in the &quot;racist evil&quot; department, so public purging is a decent add-on. </p>
