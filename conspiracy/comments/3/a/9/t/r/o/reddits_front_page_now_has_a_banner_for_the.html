<p>You asked this in response to him failing to trust someone who&#39;s operating a site endorsed thread regarding an unfolding news situation. I was saying, since someone in that position could obviously lie, it is logical to not trust them. You said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let me ask you this, what WOULD you believe?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As though you were incredulous to the fact that he was exhibiting skepticism to this person, or as though you were saying: well, wouldn&#39;t you be skeptical of everything?</p>

<p>I&#39;m saying that&#39;s not the case, it&#39;s extremely logical to be skeptical of that person. The individual person we are referring to obviously could have some incentive to lie here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something isn&#39;t adding up here.  I did a South Carolina records search for Dylann Roof, and found an entry for one Dylann Storm Roof (seriously, Storm Roof?) who was born in 1994 for a Class 1 Drug Charge on 3/5/2015 that is ongoing.  They list his address as being in Columbia SC which is 120 miles away from Charleston. I have also read reports of him living in Lexington South Carolina,  which is even farther away. </p>

<p>Seems an awful long way to drive to murder someone. How many other black churches do you think he passed along the way?   It seems to me that if his motive was really just to kill black people, that he could have done so much closer to his residence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well that spacific church is one of the oldest AME churchs in the United States and its leaders/members often played key roles in wanting equality /civil rights.  The incident seems like it was a planned. targeted thing.  That is the scary/frustrating part for a lot of people.  It may be better understood if it was in a fit of rage as blind anger can do.</p>

<p>but clearly if the person was there for over an hour, showed zero signs of rage or any threat whatsoever and then did what he did.</p>

<p>It was a deliberate planned attack.  Even so my guess is the kid really did not understand nor comprehend what he was doing, nor the fallout of it.  Likely he is some stupid idiot who fell into the wrong crowd and started believing the lies that he told himself.</p>

<p>That is what makes it i think so chilling and the sad thing is with the racial tensions escalating over the last half year or so.....the danger here is while the loss of life was terrible. the fact that this can escalate into something far worse i think is the danger.   We could be on a very real brink of a real ratial war here </p>

<p>and my fear is. LOOK at the reaction at furgison. how the entire town went ape shit over a white cop killing a black kid.  Now you have a planned. medited attack of all places a CHURCH a place of prayer by a diranged white KID (more or less) and the backlash this could bring.......honestly i really cant imagine.</p>

<p>That is the danger here and we do not need a war. War never changes.</p>

<p>No side will win.  The event was in pure blind hate. The problem is. are we going to fight hate with more hate? Thats what i worry about.  its one thing to hear it on the news its another thing if you actually are where the event takes place</p>

<p>and i am fearful for what is to come.   Honestly.   What that kid did....he has no real idea.  He think he knows he thinks hes justified in some twisted way.....but when a white guy who planned this walks into a black church and does that......I just dont see the black community sitting down on this one. </p>

<p>I gotta be totally honest. I am so fucking tired of this bullshit.  The racial game here. We are ALL human beings. I would take my time to get to know anyone of any race if they were kind, nice and open minded.  This is 2015. i am not even black im white.......but i am so sick of this bullshit We cant EVER advance at all if we are going to go back this.....id be surprised if looking back this is the event that we end up destroying ourselves over because it seems to me more and more and more human beings are terrible. We are incapible of seeing past our own noses and instead we blame everyone else..everyone else around us. we hate, we judge.....</p>

<p>how is there ever going to be any hope for anyone?  This is MY backyard and i have my own problems......what hope is there for me when i wake up and see hateful BULLSHIT like this?</p>

<p>there is no words to describe what happend. This kid could never possibly understand what he did or why he did it....and now because of it we may all be plunged into the Abyss because i wonder if its too late for any of us. I wonder if things are only going to get worse and worse and worse, while we STILL only give a crap about ourselves.</p>

<p>Even I admit i am that way. I find it hard to give a crap about anyone but..at least im not so far gone that i am not angered by this in some way this is just a very very bad omen to me ..a terrible one at what things have become.</p>

<p>funny how video games lead to inspiration sometimes the game Fallout talks about a future where humanity ends up nearly destroying each other through a 2 hour nuclear war...and in the game series those left behind have to deal with the harsh world they created.</p>

<p>and i wonder just how close are we to the brink?</p>

<p>Its 2015 not 1960 and yet now all that is going to be seen from this is white vs blacks and thats NOT what its about.</p>

<p>We need to come together not break apart. but i can imagine and see the rage that the black community will have over this</p>

<p>and perhaps as right they should......but........can we solve hate with more hate?  I dont think so.  </p>

<p>Lets just hope charleston doesnt burn over this........sighs.  Really  I am so sick of living here.......this is just aweful and to live in the place where such a horrible event happened.......sighs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m fairly optimistic about there not being riots or city wide chaos after this tragedy. While the magnitude of this atrocity definitely goes far beyond what happened in Ferguson, there are no sides to take on this issue. There&#39;s no moral grey area, or arguing about the lines between what is necessary and what is excessive. No one could rationally look at what happened here and defend the actions of this boy. I truly believe that everyone will be able to see this shooting as the horrific, needless massacre that it was and if anything, it will bring the city closer as a whole to rally against extremist bigots like this. The black community will absolutely rise up to condemn this atrocity but, unlike in Ferguson, I believe they won&#39;t feel the need to speak out violently to make a statement because this time, they&#39;ll have the support of the whole country.</p>
