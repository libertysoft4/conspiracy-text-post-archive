        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m looking for more on the web host of Dylann Roof&#39;s manifesto. There are several abnormalities that I think we should be looking into.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Dylann Roof had essentially no web presence. Searches of him from before the date of the shooting pull up nothing. It is like he didn&#39;t exist at all on the internet.</p></li>
<li><p>He chose a Russian host for his site. Reg.ru </p></li>
<li><p>There doesn&#39;t appear to be an English translation on the site. Did Dylann speak Russian? Did he just guess his way through the entire process? </p></li>
<li><p>Despite having what I would assume were tens of thousands of visits, combined with probably thousands of downloads of the 110mb zip file full of high resolution pictures, the site didn&#39;t go down. As someone who has websites, this would require a very expensive hosting package. I would estimate at least $500 a month if not much more. </p></li>
<li><p>If it did cost this much, where does an unemployed 21 year old acquire that kind of money?</p></li>
<li><p>The writing feels off in all cases. It seems like a mish-mash of common arguments against the media narrative that whites are the source of all racism. Like pointing out crime statistics or how the media only focuses on crimes against blacks and never whites. By including that language, a common response will be that anyone that makes them is associated with the guy who shot up a church. </p></li>
<li><p>The inspiration he had happens to donate to certain presidential candidates, and now they are lumped in with the shooter. </p></li>
<li><p>Hillary Clinton is now saying that &quot;Free Speech&quot; is to blame and that maybe certain speech should be outlawed. This all coming on the heels of FCC regulation of the internet. Are the questions I&#39;m asking now going to be considered radical? We already know that people invoking the US Constitution are considered radical under DHS guidelines. Who gets to determine what speech is threatening and do you believe those of us who look deeper into these issues will be free from the axe when it comes down?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Any further information on these issues would be appreciated. If anyone who speaks Russian could thoroughly investigate the options on <a href="http://reg.ru">http://reg.ru</a> that would also help. </p>

<p>Thank you</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with your comment about the speaker&#39;s accent. I wish I had seen the video before reading your comment, as that could have influenced my perception, but there are clear points where a British accent seems evident. </p>

<p>The line about not being on good terms with his parents, and &quot;without the support of your parents, you&#39;d do thing that you wouldn&#39;t think you&#39;d do&quot; just seems strange to me. That doesn&#39;t strike me as a reason to commit such an act, much less something a close friend would suppose. I might believe something like being depressed about being unemployed, or opiate withdrawal (remember the suboxone), but a poor relationship with one&#39;s parents does not cause this.</p>

<p>He also claims &quot;[Roof] said &#39;I&#39;m gonna shoot the university up. They got seven days to live,&#39; and he did it. On Wednesday, he shot that church up.&quot; This strikes me as curious. Total speculation at this point, but is it possible that the original plan was for Roof to shoot up a university, only to change it to a church at the last minute for a different effect? This might explain why there seems to be no connection or anticipation of the church beforehand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know many americans that use the word &#39;university&#39; either.  Places either get called by the acronym xxU or get called colleges even if they are infact universities.  </p>

<p>In the UK people say university all the time though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just find it so curious that all these shooters and killers just so happen to write a manifesto of some sort, detailing their ideologies, motives, etc. And they are always found by the authorities to release to the public, hmmmm very convenient. &quot;We have a suspect in custody, we&#39;re pretty sure it&#39;s him. What&#39;s that? We found his full manifesto admitting his guilt? Awesome, open and shut case Johnson. Good thing these killers like to leave hard evidence against them before they commit a crime.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s well known by criminologists and psychologists in the field that criminals create manifestos as a way of getting their ideas, thoughts, and justifications out into the media prior to executing their crimes (or posthumously).</p>

<p>They know the media spotlight will be on them. This is the very motivation why some of these crimes are committed...for the infamy and notoriety that will bring attention to their cause.  &quot;Kill for fame&quot; as the saying goes.  These people were nobodies who felt like they had no real voice or very few options.  Now, they&#39;re somebodies.</p>

<p>Weather it&#39;s because a narcissist feels inferior when it comes to acquiring sex (Elliott Rodger), they feel a celebrity is a fraud (Lennon&#39;s killer), they feel technology will be the undoing of man (Unabomber), they feel Islam is encroaching their country (Anders Breivik), or they feel generally slighted by society (Seung-Hui Cho), manifestos are not all that uncommon where crimes are committed to create a reaction from the populace.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good list. I would also like to include the point he made at the bottom of the manifesto that it was &#39;rushed&#39; and there could have been spelling mistakes, and yet we hear the narrative in the media that the shooting was planned months in advance. It can&#39;t be both. If he is publishing a manifesto, you can damn well be sure he would spend a lot of time on it and not simply write it up in 10 minutes. This is his chance to express his political views to the world. He feels he has been disenfranchised, so why would he rush it? </p>

<p>Let&#39;s not forget he had to pay and set up his website too. This isn&#39;t something he did on a whim. It was planned and methodical, yet he couldn&#39;t spell check his manifesto? Bullshit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hillary Clinton is now saying that &quot;Free Speech&quot; is to blame and that maybe certain speech should be outlawed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The irony is that censorship, and lack of a proper discussion about the links between race and crime, was the real motivating factor behind the attack. Roof felt disenfranchised by politicians and a media that were too scared or too politically correct to suggest that there may be more than just &quot;white privilege&quot; behind black violent crimes rates. The liberal narrative is that if you blame anything but poverty and white privilege, you don&#39;t deserve a platform for your views. Censorship is the issue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I posted this in another thread, but I think it fits in here pretty good as well:</p>

<p>I hadn&#39;t read the manifesto before this, but I don&#39;t believe for a second that a 21-year old kid that flunked out of high school could have written it. I don&#39;t agree with any of the content, but the sentence length and complexity, lack of any real grammatical errors, command of the language, effective use of logos, pathos and ethos, etc. lead me to believe this was written by someone with at least some college. I&#39;ve read many college English papers at a pretty good school which were written much more poorly than this.</p>

<p>And it doesn&#39;t have any real hint of passion within the writing, despite claiming to. It never rambles, and in fact follows a fairly logical progression. Not what one would expect from a hurriedly thrown together manifesto. And as <a href="/u/The_Free_Marketeer">/u/The_Free_Marketeer</a> points out, despite apologizing for the typos, there are conspicuously few. He even spells &quot;Brasil&quot; as the the Brazilians do, and not the Americans.</p>

<p>To me, this reads much more like a college-educated writer assuming the persona of white supremacist. Thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Come on, this story is totally believable.</p>

<p>Trailer park boy drops out of tenth grade, buys drugs from the money he earns mowing lawns, and lives in his car.</p>

<p>Then he goes online and becomes “radicalized” by Internet Racist Hates sites – just like this one, presumably – and decides he’s going to start a Civil War.</p>

<p>So, he whips out his American Express card and goes to town buying flag patches from obscure historical regimes and even registers and hosts his own website. He then travels around the state, posing in front of Confederate memorials with a scowl on his face and takes selfies brandishing a gun.</p>

<p>He writes a two-thousand word Manifesto – name dropping the Council of Conservative Citizens – and puts it online.</p>

<p>He get arrested at the mall for drugs – twice – then decides to go into action.</p>

<p>He walks into a church and shoots old black women – old black women like his best friend’s mom, his best friend being a black guy – because he’s really racist and wants to start the Civil War. And what better way to do that then shoot little old black ladies at church?</p>

<p>The fact that a state Senator was there meeting with the top levels of the Democratic party and the federal government was just pure happenstance and coincidence. To suggest that it was anything other than a coincidence is, of course, a “conspiracy theory.”</p>

<p>Then, the federal government and large corporations give millions of dollars to the victim’s families, even though this is a purely state matter, because … um … racism I guess.</p>

<p>It’s like that old X-Files TV show: “I WANT TO BELIEVE.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. Most of the people I know can&#39;t be found with a google search. I only know two people who show up in google results. One is a friend who works for the city and was quoted a couple times in newspaper articles. Another is a friend who wrote for her college newspaper.</p>

<p>No one&#39;s Facebook profiles show up in google. Most social media is filtered from internet search. </p>

<p>It literally means nothing that a high school dropout has limited internet presence.</p>

<p>That said, it&#39;s another lie by OP to say that &quot;It is like he didn&#39;t exist at all on the internet.&quot;</p>

<p>He had a Facebook profile, and his own web site. What did OP want? How exactly can you &quot;exist on the internet at all&quot; if those two things don&#39;t count? </p>

<p>OP is just making it up as he goes along.</p>

<p>This is called desperation. You know you are desperate when you say &quot;he has no internet presence at all&quot; about a guy with a facebook page and his own web site.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to have to disagree about the suspiciousness of the site&#39;s bandwidth. First of all, I already think it&#39;s a major stretch to assume the 110mb zip file was downloaded a particularly large number of times. As far as I know, there&#39;s nothing to indicate that it was, and, from what I understand, it would also be pretty anomalous for web traffic to behave that way. On top of that, you seem to be overestimating the cost of hosting in general. I used to get 70-100k viewers downloading multiple videos from my website a day on a very cheap &quot;unlimited bandwidth&quot; shared hosting package. Even a few steps up from that is still pretty cheap - if you buy bandwidth by connection speed for example it&#39;s pretty normal to pay, like, $50/mo. for a 2gb/s line. That&#39;s a continuous download speed of roughly 200kb/s for 10,000 simultaneous downloads, which is way, way more than I would ever expect this guy&#39;s site to be trafficked.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>(1) Dylann Roof had essentially no web presence. Searches of him from before the date of the shooting pull up nothing. It is like he didn&#39;t exist at all on the internet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>False. He had a Facebook page, and his own web site. It&#39;s amazing you would say &quot;it is like he didn&#39;t exist at all on the internet.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(2) He chose a Russian host for his site. Reg.ru</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Totally meaningless.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(3) There doesn&#39;t appear to be an English translation on the site. Did Dylann speak Russian? Did he just guess his way through the entire process?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Someone else already pointed out there are English pages that allow you to use this service.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(4) Despite having what I would assume were tens of thousands of visits, combined with probably thousands of downloads of the 110mb zip file full of high resolution pictures, the site didn&#39;t go down.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It did go down. It was down almost all day Saturday. I tried repeatedly throughout the day and got 503 errors continuously. At one point I started downloading the zip and after running super slowly for a long time, it finally crapped out completely.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Halfway through your points; all shown to be false so far.</p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>As someone who has websites, this would require a very expensive hosting package. I would estimate at least $500 a month if not much more.</p>

<p>(5) If it did cost this much, where does an unemployed 21 year old acquire that kind of money?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Others in this thread have demonstrated it would not cost very much for the level of service he got for his site.t</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(6) The writing feels off in all cases. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is purely subjective and what you &quot;feel&quot; means absolutely nothing. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It seems like a mish-mash of common arguments against the media narrative that whites are the source of all racism. Like pointing out crime statistics or how the media only focuses on crimes against blacks and never whites. By including that language, a common response will be that anyone that makes them is associated with the guy who shot up a church.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what? Means nothing. But I suspect this is what you are really upset about: You share an ideology with the killer and are upset he is casting a bad light on it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(7) The inspiration he had happens to donate to certain presidential candidates, and now they are lumped in with the shooter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah? What does this prove? It proves nothing. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>(8)  Hillary Clinton is now saying that &quot;Free Speech&quot; is to blame and that maybe certain speech should be outlawed. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a flat out lie. (Well, two lies.) She did not blame free speech, and she certainly did not suggest that certain speech should be outlawed.</p>

<hr/>

<p>So, that&#39;s it. Eight points, not a single factual or accurate statement among them. </p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>This all coming on the heels of FCC regulation of the internet. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Net Neutrality is not regulation of speech in any way, shape, or form. In fact, just the opposite: It protects speech and keeps the internet open for as many voices as possible. But you are demonstrating again that you are coming at this from a very far right point of view.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We already know that people invoking the US Constitution are considered radical under DHS guidelines. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pure bullshit.</p>
