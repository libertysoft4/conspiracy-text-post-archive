<blockquote>
<p>We are not putting this video up to judge another person’s suffering.</p>

<p>We are putting this video up because there’s a distinct and disturbing absence of suffering. There’s an eerie absence of really any emotions at all.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81__Jc1ZEkQ">This interview was conducted,</a> according to the interviewer, just 24 hours after these people’s mother was supposedly gunned down in cold blood in Charleston on June 17th.</p>

<p>Watch for yourself. There’s nothing here. No shock. Not the “love” they claim they feel, not even the “forgiveness,” and certainly an alarming absence of grief or really just any emotions at all — positive or negative.</p>

<p>The young man talks about how he was “briefed” on the situation like someone called to let him know that, oh by the way, it might rain later. We’ve seen people show more emotion at a diner when a waitress brings a cup of coffee that isn’t fresh. </p>

<p>There is just a startling lack of emotion that would normally emanate from a human being who has just been through a tragic event.</p>

<p>This isn’t even shock. It’s just nothing. It’s like a blank slate. It’s like watching robots talk.</p>

<p>It’s just as RedSilverJ says in the video; it’s as if they went straight to the acceptance stage at lightning speed. In fact, RedSilverJ from TeamWakeEmUP has more emotion <em>narrating</em> the video he put up on this than these two people in the video have throughout the entire interview.</p>

<p>It’s actually very hard to watch.</p>

<p>It reminds us of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkCB2Ee9cqw">the video of Robbie Parker</a>, the father at Sandy Hook, who is seen laughing moments before his press conference, then steeling himself and flipping from happy to sad in seconds for the cameras right before he starts to speak, just the way an actor would do right before taking part in a sketch on Saturday Night Live or something.</p>

<p>Call it crisis actors, call it whatever version of MKUltra we’re on these days, call it whatever you want. It’s just…</p>

<p>Something is not right here and if you pay attention for more than thirty seconds, you can feel it.</p>

<p>We knew this whole thing looked suspect when Al Sharpton already had a front row seat, announcing his appearance on Morning Joe at 6:30 am just hours after the shooting; when even Reuters was pushing the race baiting card, recalling everything from segregation to Sandy Hook to the 2nd Amendment to 9/11 and homegrown domestic extremists in their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150619060504/http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/18/us-usa-shooting-south-carolina-idUSKBN0OY06A20150618">kitchen sink reporting of the “facts”</a> first thing; when Karl Rove, a supposed conservative, is on Fox News right away <a href="http://www.thedailysheeple.com/karl-rove-says-the-only-way-to-stop-the-violence-is-to-repeal-our-second-amendment_062015">calling for the repeal of the 2nd Amendment</a> as the only way to stop the violence (a move which will ensure that only criminals who commit mass shootings like this one and the government will be the only ones with guns in this country)…</p>

<p>There’s a reason certain events make it to the national establishment media stage.</p>

<p>…it’s another Wag the Dog.</p>

<p>In other news, Reuters is now reporting that the Justice Department has fast-tracked $29 million dollars to the families of the Charleston shooting victims.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m 56 days late on this, but i live in charleston and actually know Chris Singleton and defintely believe this shooting was staged. Follow the dude on twitter/insta/fb and the only things hes posted since the shooting is pics of his new car, watch, and his many vacations hes been taking. The only thing posted regarding hhis mother is how her funeral would be a private immedite family only funeral. He never even posts tweets about his mother and missing her but didbt mind posting the photos of him with the obama family and yankee players. I even listened to the police scanner after hearing the news of the shooting minutes after it happened and got nothing. Dylan roof made it across state lines so it could be turned into a federal case. The best part? The arresting officers got the alleged shooter burger king before flying him back to a charleston jail on Leeds avenue (where he isnt allowed to recieve mail?) The shit is major fucked dude. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate your local on the spot report. I know something was very odd when everybody had forgiven the shooter before they had the normal time for going through the psychological process of grieving. Ha, ha, ha all this cash and Momma&#39;s still not dead. Victim&#39;s families were paid 27 million in compensation/bribes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How are they even justifying the cash payouts to the victim&#39;s families? The US government doesn&#39;t compensate victims of crime. That&#39;s just not a thing. Insurance does. Charity does. But since when does our government pay millions of dollars to families of crime victims? Do <em>all</em> families of murder victims get multimillion dollar federal payouts now, or just the high-profile ones that advance the government&#39;s cause? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the exact thing I thought when I first heard about all that money the victims got only a few days later. Then I found <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/chapter-112">this</a> . </p>

<p>It&#39;s recent. <del>Under Obama if I remember correctly</del>.</p>

<p>Edit - And its Bullshit.. I would love to see which applications get rejected and which ones don&#39;t.. &quot;and this is how we&#39;re going to pay you when it&#39;s all said and done. Any questions?&quot;</p>

<p>Edit2: from wikipedia - &quot;The Crime Victims Fund was established by the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) of 1984. The fund is financed by fines paid by convicted federal offenders. As of September 2013, the Fund balance had reached almost $9 billion. Revenues deposited into the Fund also come from gifts, donations, and bequests by private parties, as provided by an amendment to VOCA through the Patriot Act that went into effect in 2002. From 2002 – 2013, over $300 thousand dollars have been deposited into the Fund through this provision.&quot; </p>

They showed the speech he gavw the day after the shooting before one if his baseball games.  It brought me and my girlfriend to tears. I was wondering how espn had a camera crew ready to follow him around less than 24 hours after the shooting happened and why espn would be the first people he thought to contact..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m undecided between &quot;because they can&quot; or because they feel completely insecure about society and fear to loose &quot;control&quot;.</p>

<p>They just don&#39;t seem to care anymore if people see through it in a short time. That either means they are in panic mode and feel they need to do &quot;something&quot; so all you get are sloppy retarded psyops digging their hole even deeper.</p>

<p>Or they have lost all common sense, feel invincible or it&#39;s good for channeling money from some budget, whatever. </p>

<p>Look at the Confederate flag case. To me that just looked like another bi-weekly talking point pushed by some people. Had it any major social meaning to truly justify this kind of staging to control a &quot;dangerous&quot; message? Don&#39;t think so. And how successful is this gun control agenda again when people just buy more guns the more crazier the US system gets...</p>

<p>But then we might also experience James Bond&#39;s &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; where all these big news psyops have no inner meaning than to fill the news(profit) and cloud our senses(fear). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s plenty of motives for the hoax. A big one being money, they got a donation text number within 12 hours of the shooting. United we stand and divided we fall. The hoax led to a semi race war, which led to the confederate flag being taken down. Many of friendships ended and there was plenty of riots all over Charleston. KKK members were passing out fliers all over town, claiming to be patrolling which caused the thugs of the town to become more violent. While the entire country was feuding over the confederate flag being taken down, they passed the TPP (Trans Pacific Partnership) which turned our country into a corporate playground. Money, money, and more money. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is true. A friend of mine was caught after being on the run for 17 years. He was in another state than the one he had charges in. When the deputy&#39;s from the jail flew in to pick him up, they got a rental car, took him to Walmart to get clothes to wear on the trip back( he was arrested at night, sleeping, wearing boxers), then took him out to get something to eat before the plane trip back.</p>

both of these are from his birthday/the fourth of july. The only thing he says about his mom is how he wishes he would&#39;ve taken more selfies with her. Lol I assume not because he misses her but because he can never take any more photos with her again. Chris was an athlete, and I&#39;m sure the idea of fame, money, and being able to sign to any team he wanted sounded like a good enough reason to go along with pretending his mom was dead. This past weekend, he flew up to new york to play a game with the Yankees, throwing the first pitch of the game. In March, two months prior to the shooting, he uploaded a photo with his mom that had a Christmas tree in the background, so it obviously wasn&#39;t recent. Why upload a pic that was taken in December in march? 
<a href="http://i.imgur.com/Hllwzbi.png">http://i.imgur.com/Hllwzbi.png</a></p>

<p>A week after the shooting, one of his friends brags about all the celebrity he&#39;s meeting. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/oDitEkP.png">http://i.imgur.com/oDitEkP.png</a></p>

<p>Chris&#39; mother was laid to rest in private by just her family according to this guy, but on Chris&#39; public social media he implies that there&#39;s going to be a public funeral. Either way, it&#39;s weird the way this was worded. </p>

<p>This people&#39;s article was posted July 19th, a day and a half after the shooting. They managed to get in contact with one of Sharonda&#39;s friends who said she had already pre planned what her obituary would say and the music she would play at it. I also find that to be pretty weird.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you have a youtube channel?</p>

<p>I do.  I lived near Sandy Hook and I investigated that.</p>

<p>Can you go to the church where the shooting happened?  Can you go inside, and bring a videocamera, and take some photos inside of where the shooting supposedly happened?</p>

<p>It is legal in South Carolina if one party (you) is aware the call is being recorded.  So, you can record any phone calls you make throughout the state.</p>

<p>Can you call the church?  And ask them which hazardous materials/biological cleanup services they used?  Tell them you had something similar happen at your grandmas home, and you dont know how to clean it.  See what they say.  You know they had to clean up the area of all the blood, if it was real....right?</p>

<p>Sharon, do most people believe it down there?</p>

<p>I dont believe it was real.</p>

<p>Nice to meet you, my name is Charl.</p>

<p>God bless you!</p>

<p>He exemplifies shock.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Acute stress reaction (also called acute stress disorder, psychological shock, mental shock, or simply shock) is a psychological condition arising in response to a terrifying or traumatic event...</p>

<p>Common symptoms that sufferers of acute stress disorder experience are: numbing; emotional detachment; muteness; derealization; depersonalization; psychogenic amnesia; continued re-experiencing of the event via thoughts, dreams, and flashbacks; and avoidance of any stimulation that reminds them of the event. During this time, they must have symptoms of anxiety, and significant impairment in at least one essential area of functioning. Symptoms last for a minimum of 2 days, and a maximum of 4 weeks, and occur within 4 weeks of the event.<sup>[1]</sup></p>

<p>I suppose you live in Houston? How about we send a patzy to come to house of worship where your family attends, shoot your parents in the face and lets see how you respond a day later. </p>

<p>Nothing about the kids expressions, mannerisms or responses exemplifies shock. He acts as if he he could care less that their mother was just murdered. WHY? Because he just got a check cut for 3.2 million dollars thats why!</p>

<p>Did you even read the description of shock that Mr. Houston provided? Here, try again:</p>
