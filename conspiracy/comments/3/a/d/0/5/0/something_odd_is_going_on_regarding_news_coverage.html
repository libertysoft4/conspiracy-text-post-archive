<p>so that bill mentions House approved of the TPP bill with a vote total of 218-208. But the only vote turnout that was equal to that was this one below which does not mention the TPP at all and deals with retirement for public officials.
<a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/114-2015/h374">https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/114-2015/h374</a></p>

<p>Now i see this bill dealing with the TPP and it passed but the vote turnout is much different
<a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/114-2015/h373">https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/114-2015/h373</a></p>

<p>Did the Hill mess up the numbers? They never mention what the actual bill name is just talking vaguely about the tpp with an update on vote results. </p>

<p>I am asking in regards to is tpp stuff buried in this bill on retirement or did the hill just mess up the numbers which is a problem because then we have a ton of people bitching on the net posting this article but its completely wrong with the numbers showing that people will post stuff but not actually research anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, to clearify- what you have here <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/114-2015/h373">https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/114-2015/h373</a> (you&#39;re first link) is an admendment to this bill <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/114-2015/h374">https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/114-2015/h374</a> (you&#39;re second link)</p>

<p>The amendment passed, then the bill passed.  That said, you are correct, I see nothing in <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2146/text">HR 2146</a> (that passed 218-208) that relates to the TPP.  However, I see nothing in <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-resolution/321?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22%5C%22hres321%5C%22%22%5D%7D">HR 321</a> that contains language to a trade deal either, so I&#39;m just very confused all around.</p>

<p>EDIT: so I found this: <a href="https://rules.house.gov/bill/114/hr-2146-sa">https://rules.house.gov/bill/114/hr-2146-sa</a>, which links to this: <a href="https://rules.house.gov/bill/114/hr-2146-sa">https://rules.house.gov/bill/114/hr-2146-sa</a></p>

<p>So from what I understand, the old HR321 was amended on the floor to include the TPP language <a href="https://rules.house.gov/bill/114/hr-2146-sa">in this link</a> (passed 244-181).  That amendment was then added to HR 2146, which then passed 218-208.  </p>

<p>Corporate news companies don&#39;t want the people to know what their corporate masters are trying to do, which is why I&#39;m not surprised that it&#39;s gotten zero attention today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="/u/JustAnotherGuyPoopin">/u/JustAnotherGuyPoopin</a> is close, but not 100% accurate.  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-resolution/321?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22%5C%22hres321%5C%22%22%5D%7D">H Res 321</a> is not an amendment to <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2146?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22%5C%22hr2146%5C%22%22%5D%7D">HR 2146</a> as he states.  </p>

<p>H Res 321 is <a href="http://rules.house.gov/bill/114/hr-2146-sa">the rule governing consideration of HR 2146.</a> </p>

<p><a href="http://amendments-rules.house.gov/amendments/RYANWI_03761715141607167.pdf">The amendment to HR 2146 is here.</a></p>

<p>The rule governs consideration of the bill - a completely different bill from the bill considered last week.  </p>

<p>Rules are pretty common for &quot;controversial&quot; bills (any bill that can&#39;t get 2/3 of the vote).  </p>

<p>They govern what amendments are in order generally.  However, as was done here, they can deem an amendment passed for purposes of consideration on the House floor.  </p>

<p>So while a vote for the rule effectively resulted in the inclusion of the amendment, it was not a vote for the amendment per se.  </p>

<p>As to press reporting on it, to be somewhat fair to them, the main thing is that frankly, I doubt most of them understand what happened.  </p>

<p>I know a lot of staffers that don&#39;t really understand what happened.  For the most part the Hill rags did understand what happened, but mainstream press? No way in hell.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s even more convoluted that I thought. </p>

<p>If I may ask</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They govern what amendments are in order generally</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you say order; is that defined as sequence, or as in &quot;rules of order&quot; i.e. allowed?   I&#39;m assuming rules of order, but I&#39;d hate to be wrong.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>while a vote for the rule effectively resulted in the inclusion of the amendment, it was not a vote for the amendment per se.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By that you mean, a vote for the rules was not indicative of agreeing to that amendment because they didn&#39;t know it was in there?  Why cast a yea vote for the rule if you&#39;re not ok with the amendment added to it?</p>

<p>Thanks for clearing this all up for me.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Generally speaking what&#39;s allowed. That said, a structured rule (a rule making only certain amendments in order) still generally list the amendments made in order and say they have to be made in that order. That&#39;s usually not important, but can be.   </p>

<p>This would be considered a closed rule, since really no amendments were made in order. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>By that you mean, a vote for the rules was not indicative of agreeing to that amendment because they didn&#39;t know it was in there?  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everyone (with competent staff at least) knew it was there. It&#39;s not that uncommon a practice. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why cast a yea vote for the rule if you&#39;re not ok with the amendment added to it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s a party loyalty thing. A rule going down is seen as a major rebuke of leadership. It&#39;s as close as the house would get to a vote of no confidence as can occur in parliamentary systems. </p>

<p>When the 30 Rs voted against the rule the first time this came up, I&#39;m sure there was a lot of yelling. Wouldn&#39;t be surprised if people lost committee assignments when the smoke clears. </p>

<p>It&#39;s also note that the mindset with a rule doing this (deeming an amendment passed) is probably different than you&#39;re thinking. Most members and staff (in both parties) ultimately viewed this as a rule to consider TPA. Not as a rule that slips an amendment in. In other words, a rule to consider the end product described in the rule, however it&#39;s created. </p>

<p>No problem. </p>
