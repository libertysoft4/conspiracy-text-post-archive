<p>The sedimentary layers actually reveal trees upright through hundreds of the layers at once all over the world. All of the sediment from all over the world was washed around and slowly laid out into layers over the course of the flood and however long it took for the water to settle off of the continents and into the valleys.</p>

<p>I encourage you to look into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZrxogY9Pnc">flood geology lecture</a>s and the like. It&#39;s fascinating stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look at your own post, and how often this question comes up, despite how easy it is to show that they have total control of your entire reality. They&#39;ve made people so stupid and lazy in their own heads that they aren&#39;t even interested in the truth anymore, just an entertaining story packaged for them while they wait passively. Behold the fruits of mass indoctrination in government training centers.</p>

<p>&quot;One of the saddest lessons of history is this: if we&#39;ve been bamboozled long enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle. We&#39;re no longer interested in finding out the truth. The bamboozle has captured us.

<p>Because it is very likely that UFOs from outerspace is a massive psyop backed by Rockefeller money to prep us for a fake alien invasion.  Also the fact that people are so normalized to UFOs through their promotion in popular culture which is completely controlled.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have two different &#39;why&#39; questions intricately bundled.</p>

<p>One is a philosophical &#39;why&#39;, why would anyone do this, requiring a subjective answer, and which definitely depends upon knowledge none of us (in this conversation) have. I have many different speculations on this topic but am not interested in sharing any with this particular battleground.</p>

<p>The other is the practical &#39;why&#39;, why a sphere instead of flat, requiring an objective answer. The Flat Earth model explains many physical phenomena in a much more coherent manner, as explained in my <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/393icm/whats_all_this_flat_earth_stuff_about_anyway/">Flat Earth primer</a>. Specific examples include sailors navigating at sea by assuming a plane, lighthouses providing utility beyond the limit of the expected curvature of the Earth, and railroads being designed over vast distances without having to account for any curvature deviation. So when you ask for practical examples of using the Flat Earth model, they are all around you. None of the actual physical models of our everyday interactions account for curvature and all the &#39;relative&#39; movement we should be experiencing as we rotate, wobble, tilt, orbit, and hurtle through &#39;outer space&#39;.</p>

<p>Observations of the night sky, the horizon, the sun and the moon: these all make much more sense under a Flat Earth model. Under a ball Earth model, you are left completely confused when faced with physical observations in the real world: you require a heliocentrist expert priest to bring you back into the herd with the approved dogma, which nowadays can be found on wikipedia. You trust NASA over your own lying eyes, and will be forever dependent on experts to define your reality. Society becomes one large <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments">Asch conformity experiment</a> that isn&#39;t interested in and can&#39;t focus on anything other than the latest entertaining distraction.</p>

<p>Humanity is trapped in the age of &quot;the crowned and conquering child&quot;, ignorant of its past and present, and unconcerned with its future.</p>

<p>&quot;Everywhere his (Horus) government is taking root. Observe for yourselves the decay of the sense of sin, the growth of innocence and irresponsibility, the strange modifications of the reproductive instinct with a tendency to become bi-sexual or epicene, the childlike confidence in progress combined with nightmare fear of catastrophe, against which we are yet half unwilling to take precautions. Consider the popularity of the cinema, the wireless, the football pools and guessing competitions, all devices for soothing fractious infants, no seed of purpose in them. Consider sport, the babyish enthusiasms and rages which it excites, whole nations disturbed by disputes between boys. Consider war, the atrocities which occur daily and leave us unmoved and hardly worried. <strong>We are children.</strong>&quot; -Aleister Crowley</p>
