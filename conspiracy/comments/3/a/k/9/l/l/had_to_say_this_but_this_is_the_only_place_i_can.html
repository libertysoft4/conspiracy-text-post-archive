<p>What do people expect if kids are taught to be selfish, obedient machines? Ever since i can remember, schools have been teaching kids to be selfish and obedient beyond anything. Any kid who tries to stick up for someone in the face of authority or anything else really is said to shut up and mind his own business. Kids are told to have more empathy for animals than for their fellow humans. They are put in a constant state of competition, and are encouraged to keep it alive. If everyone is taught that other humans are always and solely trying to out do them or compete with them, then why are people surprised when kids turn into misanthropes? What do you expect if kids are told to pursue wealth and personal profit over anything, including their humanity and ethics? If a small bag of weed is a bigger problem than bullying a kid to suicide, why the fuck are we still surprised when kids are growing up to be selfish, hateful, misanthropic pieces of shit? Its really a logical result to the current educational system.</p>

<p>You&#39;re making strides in the right direction and as a good exercise of the mind for you and anyone else reading this response is to imagine. </p>

<p>Imagine a way the world can work without a government, we as a species can make and manipulate extremely complicated systems and technology. </p>

<p>There is absolutely no way possible for us not to be able to figure out a peaceful system that lifts up us all instead of a parasitic minority.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bob Marley wasn&#39;t murdered.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s mostly the banks, and their stranglehold over the last 100 years or so. The bigger central banks that have been around a long time have us by the nards. </p>

<p>As most people probably know, a bank was set up in 1913 by some rich guys who have very long term plans to form a one world gov&#39;t they control. If you see some of their literature from back in the day (like 1800s) they say things like, &quot;banks make 50 and 100 year plans that are more powerful and sustain over generations than any individual&quot;. Long game shit.</p>

<p>Consider since 1913, banks and the corporations they buy lobbying the gov&#39;t to pass laws that can further their profits. Just about any politician can be &quot;lobbied&quot; with an envelope of some kind. Now with those profits, consider non-ending compound interest payments, coming in from any country whose agreed to a foreign central bank (&quot;agreed&quot; used loosely, more like over the course of 25 years; and throw in a war or two). All those profits add up like a snowball avalanche.</p>

<p>Tell me why I&#39;m wrong but, I think banks are the biggest broken element. If our countries could borrow money from themselves, pay the interest to themselves or not at all, such to be able to manage and maintain in public view, monetary inflation and control of the economy, we&#39;d be in much better shape. Nevermind countries could invest the money they print in their own infrastructure. Instead, monetary and economic paths are guided by private banks behind closed doors. We have no idea what they&#39;re planning and can&#39;t elect people to do anything about it.</p>

<p>Stopping these ridiculous interest payments is key; but the banks (and consequently media) would warn us of collapse, doom, inability, and blah blah blah. More brainwashing us back into their bank arms. They would probably screw us over and take all our money if we were to switch off their system somehow. Can we elect someone to pass something like a banking fee cap? Anyway, the banks have come so far in their plan that they control all of this and there&#39;s like, no avenue left for someone to make a case without getting discredited or disappeared. </p>

<p>I kinda think the democracy/free market program could work but it&#39;s been too polluted by private banks. Removing the bank problem would certainly reduce corporate inequality but there still needs to be another checkpoint with corrupt politicians. If we reset all businesses back to square one, and people started growing their businesses again - say, on a new system - some will just go start buying politicians again. Publicizing financials (donations, expenses, campaigns) of a politician will go a long way for informing voters. And voters would care more because they would see direct economic feedback from the work of their politicians who can properly govern monetary policy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason I believe he was murdered is the fact that there was a known attempt by a gunmen (believed to be politically motivated) to take his life - but he survived. This story about him is awesome: </p>

<p>&quot;Bob Marley had this idea, it was kind of a virologist idea, he believed he could cure racism and hate, literally cure it by injecting music and love into people&#39;s lives. One day he was scheduled to perform at a peace concert, a gunmen came to his house and shot him down. Two days later he walked out on that stage and sang. Somebody asked him why. He said, &#39;the people who are trying to make this world worse aren&#39;t taking a day off. How can I?&#39;&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well consider this and tell me if you see any holes in the logic.</p>

<p>Small to medium sized groups that are interdependent and independent. </p>

<p>Each person of the group fill roles that suit their personality on an individual basis.</p>

<p>This allows each group to better identify any outliers and determine whether they are a threat or not. </p>

<p>No threat no sweat, the outlier is free to remain or go and form their own group.</p>

<p>The individual groups would be able to spot threats and each member would work cooperatively with one another in mutual defense. </p>

<p>If a group of violent and or threatening assholes form then the rest of the groups can easily spot them and deal with them realizing that they are a threat to all not just their neighbors. </p>

<p>Independent, educated, interdependent, autonomous social groups with no centralized authority all over the world working to survive and grow.</p>

<p>The way to this world is along the path this sub and most of its participants are walking right now.</p>

<p>We&#39;re identifying the threats, once a consensus is reached we can move forward.</p>

<p>The threats have been at it for millennia and haven&#39;t completed their agenda. We&#39;ve got a few decades at it and we&#39;re making progress faster.</p>

<p>I guess I don&#39;t know how to answer this, basically I&#39;m for decentralized organizations and zero globalization. Trade, commerce, and their derivatives should be discussed openly among all affected parties. That&#39;s the best I have for this it&#39;s a work in progress.</p>

<p>Form another group, share responsibility, rotate roles and relax during off time... Paint a pony or something, go fishing, touch yourself, take a trip?

<p>No, fire can&#39;t be fought without fire. Each group should understand the need for defense. Conspirators will conspire, at the point of violence then they would be met with resistance to preserve peace.

I think you should try researching parecon, it clears up a bit of the problems i am seeing with the way you describe things now, although you do use vague language.

    <div class="md"><p>So much text that amounts to nothing but an idealist dream. You must understand that any system must take into account how people truly react. If people started with independent smaller groups there would inevitably be merging of groups into larger systems, given enough time and you would revert back to what we have today. </p>

<p>All your comments are so vague, nothing concrete and when a libertarian is asked for concrete answers he simply says that he cannot provide them because he does not have the thinking capacity of all mankind. He exempts himself from answering and deals only in vague statements. Iv been listening to Stefan Molynieux for years and that&#39;s exactly how he talks. </p>

<p>What is keeping you from going to another part of the world and live without government? You are an individual with self determining powers and a &quot;beautiful&quot; theory of how society should be structured, I suggest you walk the talk. </p>

<p>What if I don&#39;t want to be part of a small or medium group (what ever that means) what if I want to be part of a HUGE group? What if our group pressures smaller groups into submission? This entire fucking theory is completely disconnected from human nature, like communism its nothing but a nice idea. </p>

<p>It&#39;s much more important to bring light to the things that would help open everyone&#39;s eyes to reality. The biggest obstacle is that it&#39;s difficult for anyone to accept how bad it is. Once people start opening their eyes it will spread like wildfire. </p>

<p>If I went over to my neighbors house and took their money and told them I was now representing them,  do you think they would be willing and allow me to do this?</p>

<p>There&#39;s so many things that the government is spending my money on,  which absolutely do not represent me,  or anyone else then a very small group of people. </p>

<p>Take the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/lawmakers-move-to-curb-1-billion-cia-program-to-train-syrian-rebels/2015/06/12/b0f45a9e-1114-11e5-adec-e82f8395c032_story.html">recent article</a> which exposed that the CIA is spending $1,000,000,000 a year on funding and arming our enemies in Syria. How is this keeping me safe?  How am I benefiting in anyway from this?  Governments over the last 100 years have killed 270 million of their own people,  not including wars.  It&#39;s called Democide. </p>

<p>Take the banker bailouts.  They used our money to bail out banks who made reckless decisions, even though it was hugely unpopular with everyone.  Take the NSA wiretapping, foreign wars in Iraq and Libya, nuking Japan,  Patriot Act,  TPP, TPA, Nafta, CISPA, SOPA, etc.  These were all actions which our government has taken,  or laws which they passed, which did not have a majority support from the people who paid for them.  This does not represent me,  or most Americans.  </p>

<p>They are not held to the same standards which they enforce on the people who they govern, and are left unaccountable to anyone,  that&#39;s my problem.</p>

<p>I&#39;m ok with small,  very small local governance who are usually held accountable by the people they represent.  I&#39;m not willing to give my liberties up for a false sense of being secure.  </p>

<p>This is a bad analogy. The governemnt does not take your money to represent you just cause, it&#39;s part of a bigger system that helps you live your day-to-day life, and benefits you as well.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe anyone promises (or can deliver, for that matter) 100% safety. They say they will try too keep you safe, in exchange for a small part of your money. And while that is not perfect, would you prefer the chaos that would emerge upon the dissapearing of the government?</p>

<p>So if government were so good and malovent, and the benefits so obvious in our &quot;day to day lives&quot;, why isn&#39;t it voluntary?   Why can&#39;t I just not be a part of it if I don&#39;t like it?  Why do they use the threat of force to anyone who wishes to live in free?  Why is it forced upon us through the barrel of a gun if it is truly such a good thing?   </p>

<p>I have recently found the concept of <a href="http://voluntaryist.com/fundamentals/introduction.html#.VYcUi8nD_qA">Voluntarism</a> which has been really appealing to me in a post government era. This is the definition of true Freedom and true Liberty in my mind. </p>

<p>Voluntaryism is defined as; </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Voluntaryism is the doctrine that relations among people should be by mutual consent, or not at all. It represents a means, an end, and an insight. Voluntaryism does not argue for the specific form that voluntary arrangements will take; only that force be abandoned so that individuals in society may flourish. As it is the means which determine the end, the goal of an all voluntary society must be sought voluntarily. People cannot be coerced into freedom. Hence, the use of the free market, education, persuasion, and non-violent resistance as the primary ways to change people&#39;s ideas about the State. The voluntaryist insight, that all tyranny and government are grounded upon popular acceptance, explains why voluntary means are sufficient to attain that end.</p>

<p>would you prefer the chaos that would emerge upon the dissapearing of the government?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I completely reject the concept that the government is the one who provides humans with safety from chaos. In fact,  I&#39;d even argue that once we as humanity throw away the idea that government is the only thing which keeps us safe, we could live in a much more free, fulfilling and prosperous world. Again,  I believe if you remove the coercive part of government,  the monopoly of the use of force,  freedom and liberty will naturally follow. I think government is the prime contributor to most all of the chaos we have in this world now. </p>

<p>Is it? I say that you live on their ground, using their resources, eating their food. Now you may ask, who gave them all these? People that realized that it&#39;s not possible otherwise.  How would you be able to buy/sell anything without anyone keeping control over currency or enforcing some kind of market rules etc?And how would you posses a certain part of land where you live if there wouldn&#39;t be some kind of force to protect your rights? </p>

<p>Without government we will go (back?) to each man for himself, some kind of postapocalyptic dis/utopian setting which will not do anyone any kind of good. Do you think people will just be medics or teachers or firemen without anyone to pay them? Won&#39;t people need to gather around again to protect themselfes against the criminals or whatever else?</p>

<p>The whole game of life needs rules to be played, rules that need to be enforced somehow. While the government isn&#39;t the best thing there could be, it&#39;s the best we have.</p>

<p>You must not have heard about BitCoin?  A decentralized currency which isn&#39;t held hostage by any government or central bank,  only by the free market. While not very old,  and still untested over the long term,  it&#39;s proof that no government is needed to enforce the currency. </p>

<p>I&#39;m really not inferring to doing away with the justice system all together,  please don&#39;t get me wrong.  I think that for every problem which arises,  humans are by far the best problem solvers,  especially when not coerced into a solution they don&#39;t want. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not even saying I want to remove all forms of governments, just that we all would get much more bang for our dollar if we got to pick and choose on a voluntary level what we as individuals want to spend our money on. </p>

<p>You also never answered my questions; </p>

<p>That is one thing I cannot truly answer, and I have stumbled on it a few times as well. The only thing I answered myself was &quot;Life itself is forced upon everyone. You don&#39;t choose to be born.&quot; Therefore, I say, why would anyone let you live within their territory without paying the price to live there? Earth is a llimited space, everything is occupied, you simply have to live somewhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably the most truth I have seen anywhere in a long time. In fact I honestly think that if there is any hope for us, we need to make this the focus. Rather than first trying to &quot;wake up&quot; people by pointing out government and media cover ups, and other issues, the focus of those of us that are &quot;awake&quot; should be to somehow show everyone how truly destructive it is to be so selfish.</p>

<p>It&#39;s similar to the idea of needing to fix yourself before you can fix everyone else&#39;s problems. As a society we are literally all taught to be cancerous, so is it any surprise that all we manage to do is spread around more cancer? So if you can somehow get everyone to stop and examine themselves, they will all see that what we are cannot possibly be measured by the objects we possess, but instead how many people have you helped today? </p>

<p>Most of us are desperate to find a solution to the big problems. Here is one solution.</p>

I&#39;ve been approached by a homeless couple asking for food so I went and got them something to eat and was asked by others why I was helping some druggie bums; I was in a Jack-In-The-Box once and saw an older man who had a hospital bracelet on who looked like he had been beat up pretty bad, he was digging for some change to buy tacos so I asked him if I could buy him something to eat. Again, I was asked why I was helping someone based upon the way he looked. I like helping people when I can, it makes me feel good and it makes them feel good to know someone cares, and feeding people is my way of showing love. </p>

<p>Looking back on it now,  I can point to being in private school as one of the major reasons that I&#39;m &quot;awake&quot;. In addition to being taught selflessness,  kindness, and to love everyone,  including those who were different then I was,  most importantly,  it taught me how to critically think information.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. The way I see it it all comes down to the programming we receive throughout our lives and the beliefs we carry with us. The good news is we aren&#39;t meant to live this way and many are tuning out and taking the time to find who they are and what their dreams, goals and aspirations are. Soul searching inevitably leads us to be better human beings. </p>

<p>In computer terms it&#39;s as if we are a system that has the ability to over-ride our original programming and start writing new code that makes the system more stable and efficient.</p>

<p>As various commenters have said, the study was not exactly scientific, and would need to repeated (using identical conditions for all groups) to see if the findings are indicative of a real difference between the cultures. </p>

<p>Assuming the results do reveal a genuine difference, I am not sure what the lesson to take from this is. Are British children too controlled by authority, with American kids being more independently minded? Is the American dog-eat-dog society stereotype true, and does it encourage children to win at all costs? Maybe a bit of both. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Kids are told to have more empathy for animals than for their fellow human beings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;d say it&#39;s the exact opposite. There wouldn&#39;t be 150,000,000,000 animals slaughtered needlessly every year if we were taught to love them. People wouldn&#39;t see pigs, cows, chickens, and many other animals as just hunks of meat  either. God forbid, don&#39;t eat that dog or that cat or everybody loses their minds. Yet, you can eat 10 slices of bacon and nobody panics. I agree with everything else you said, however. Good point.</p>

It is true though that most people only care about &quot;cute&quot; animals, but more than half of newer generation people value some exotic animals life over the life of an innocent stranger, because they feel no affiliation to the stranger, but they like the looks of that big cat.</p>
