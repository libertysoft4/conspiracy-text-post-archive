        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>1) The FEMA metallurgy report.</p>

<p>The analysis performed on the WTC steel by Professor Jonathan Barnett proves that it was attacked by some form of munition, since it was riddled with holes and had been severely eroded/melted by something containing high concentrations of sulfur.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;The severe corrosion and subsequent erosion of samples 1 and 2 are a very unusual event. No clear explanation for the source of the sulfur has been identified.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.fema.gov/pdf/library/fema403_apc.pdf">http://www.fema.gov/pdf/library/fema403_apc.pdf</a></p>

<p><strong>A one-inch column has been reduced to half-inch thickness. Its edges--which are curled like a paper scroll--have been thinned to almost razor sharpness. Gaping holes--some larger than a silver dollar--let light shine through a formerly solid steel flange. This Swiss cheese appearance shocked all of the fire-wise professors, who expected to see distortion and bending--but not holes.</strong></p>

<p>2) The hijackers’  VISA applications.</p>

<p>Investigating the attacks, political journal National Review obtained copies of the VISA applications for 15 of the 19 named hijackers, and in the process found that all 15 should have been refused entry to the country.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;A new report accuses the State Department of staggering lapses in its visa program that gave Sept. 11 hijackers entry into the United States.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The political journal National Review obtained the visa applications for 15 of the 19 hijackers — and evidence that all of them should have been denied entry to the country.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>3) Clairvoyance.</p>

<p>The former Pakistani foreign secretary claims he was told by top-level American officials at a UN meeting in July 2001, that military action would be taken against Afghanistan by October.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;Niaz Naik, a former Pakistani Foreign Secretary, was told by senior American officials in mid-July that military action against Afghanistan would go ahead by the middle of October.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>4) Military grade munitions.</p>

<p>Professor Niels Harrit published a peer-reviewed paper in 2009 proving the existence of high-energy thermite residue in four out of four WTC samples.</p>

<p>5) The bin Laden &quot;confession tape&quot; is a demonstrable fraud.</p>

<p><strong>Professor Bruce Lawrence, head of Duke University&#39;s religious studies&#39; department and the foremost Bin Laden expert, argues that the increasingly secular language in the video and audio tapes of Osama (his earliest ones are littered with references to God and the Prophet Mohammed) are inconsistent with his strict Islamic religion, Wahhabism.</strong></p>

<p><strong>He notes that, on one video, Bin Laden wears golden rings on his fingers, an adornment banned among Wahhabi followers.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Urban dictionary: Magic Video Tape.</strong></p>

<p><strong>This is the VHS tape that was miraculously found by US troops in Afghanistan which contained an alleged confession by Osama bin Laden to be the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. He previously denied involvement so it was fortuitous that this tape was found in a country the size of Texas. The man in the video tape does not really look like bin Laden but the media has failed to point this out.</strong></p>

<p>6) Israeli intelligence were literally caught  “dancing in celebration”.</p>

<p>Amazing, but provable, and not quite as amazing as being caught and then let go.</p>

<p><strong>THERE was ruin and terror in Manhattan, but, over the Hudson River in New Jersey, a handful of men were dancing.</strong></p>

<p><strong>As the World Trade Centre burned and crumpled, the five men celebrated and filmed the worst atrocity ever committed on American soil as it played out before their eyes.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Who do you think they were? Palestinians? Saudis? Iraqis, even? Al-Qaeda, surely? Wrong on all counts. They were Israelis - and at least two of them were Israeli intelligence agents, working for Mossad, the equivalent of MI6 or the CIA.</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.heraldscotland.com/five-israelis-were-seen-filming-as-jet-liners-ploughed-into-the-twin-towers-on-september-11-2001-1.829220">http://www.heraldscotland.com/five-israelis-were-seen-filming-as-jet-liners-ploughed-into-the-twin-towers-on-september-11-2001-1.829220</a></p>

<p>7) British university study confirms that 9/11 &quot;Conspiracy Theorists&quot; are the sane ones.</p>

<p>We all knew this anyway, but for what it&#39;s worth:-</p>

<p><strong>Recent studies by psychologists and social scientists in the US and UK suggest that contrary to mainstream media stereotypes, those labeled “conspiracy theorists” appear to be saner than those who accept the official versions of contested events.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The most recent study was published on July 8th by psychologists Michael J. Wood and Karen M. Douglas of the University of Kent (UK). Entitled “What about Building 7? A social psychological study of online discussion of 9/11 conspiracy theories,” the study compared “conspiracist” (pro-conspiracy theory) and “conventionalist” (anti-conspiracy) comments at news websites.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The authors were surprised to discover that it is now more conventional to leave so-called conspiracist comments than conventionalist ones: “Of the 2174 comments collected, 1459 were coded as conspiracist and 715 as conventionalist.” In other words, among people who comment on news articles, those who disbelieve government accounts of such events as 9/11 and the JFK assassination outnumber believers by more than two to one. That means it is the pro-conspiracy commenters who are expressing what is now the conventional wisdom, while the anti-conspiracy commenters are becoming a small, beleaguered minority.</strong></p>

<p>8) Cheney likely gave a direct order not to shoot down flight 77.</p>

<p>The testimony of Norman Mineta before the 9/11 commission seems to suggest Cheney was kept aware of the path of flight 77 as it approached the Pentagon, and that he repeated an order not to shoot it down.</p>

<p><strong>MR. HAMILTON: We thank you for that. I wanted to focus just a moment on the Presidential Emergency Operating Center. You were there for a good part of the day. I think you were there with the vice president. And when you had that order given, I think it was by the president, that authorized the shooting down of commercial aircraft that were suspected to be controlled by terrorists, were you there when that order was given?</strong></p>

<p><strong>MR. MINETA: No, I was not. I was made aware of it during the time that the airplane coming into the Pentagon. There was a young man who had come in and said to the vice president, &quot;The plane is 50 miles out. The plane is 30 miles out.&quot; And when it got down to, &quot;The plane is 10 miles out,&quot; the young man also said to the vice president, &quot;Do the orders still stand?&quot; And the vice president turned and whipped his neck around and said, &quot;Of course the orders still stand. Have you heard anything to the contrary?</strong></p>

<p>9) Who really gained?</p>

<p>Massive corporate contracts in a region which for the last 60 years had been pretty much off-limits to America because of the Cold War and the counter influence of the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Most of Israel&#39;s enemies taken out of action and replaced with pro-US governments?</p>

<p>Come on. </p>

<p>10) This.</p>

<p>Read both parts.</p>

<p><strong>A pilot who wrote a conspiracy theory book about 9/11 is dead after he shot his two teenage children and family dog before turning the gun on himself.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Micalia Phillips, 14, and her 17-year-old brother Alex, were also found dead at the home inside the gated Forrest Meadows community.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The former airline pilot&#39;s controversial conspiracy book The Big Bamboozle: 9/11 and the War on Terror was released last year.</strong></p>

<p><strong>While he was writing it, Marshall believed that his life was in danger because of the allegations involved.</strong></p>

<p><strong>According to Santa Barbara View, during the editing and pre-marketing process of Marshall’s book, he expressed some degree of paranoia because the nonfiction work accused the George W. Bush administration of being in cahoots with the Saudi intelligence community in training the hijackers who died in the planes used in the attacks.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Investigative Reporter Finds Holes In Official Finding Of Murder-Suicide In California Death of 9/11 Author.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The 9/11 author who was found dead in his California home earlier this month was right-handed, but authorities determined that he shot himself in the left side of the head, a prominent investigative journalist reports.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The bodies of Phillip Marshall, his two children, and the family dog were found on February 2, and officials quickly determined it was a murder-suicide. But the Washington, D.C.-based Wayne Madsen Report (WMR) has found evidence that contradicts the official finding. WMR reports that Marshall might have possessed something in his Murphys, California, home that prompted someone to commit murder. Also, the community in Calaveras County is pushing for the sheriff&#39;s office to conduct a more thorough investigation.</strong></p>

<p>There are of course, probably 100 or more clues that this was a false flag attack, but I have focused on a few simply for brevity. Please feel free to add your own. For me, it begins and ends with the method used to bring down WTC 1 and 2. It is a scientific fact that the steel columns were attacked by some form of military thermite munition, which almost certainly eradicates al Qaeda from further inquiry into their collapses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have pointed this out before, and I will point it out again.  <em>First I would like to say that I have no official stance to what actually did or didn&#39;t happen on 9/11, but I am very open-minded.</em></p>

<p>I worked for a company, and one of our customers was in the WTC.  I was working for them on site on various occasions, a year or so before 9/11.  The WTC at that time was undergoing some heavy...maintenance.  They had contractors working all over the building with open access.  They could have brought anything in with them, and they did, I saw this.</p>

<p>While I was at security signing in, and they had checked my bag and emptied my pockets, these general contractors (who by the way didn&#39;t look like <em>any</em> general contractors I had ever seen before, they were sharp, clean cut, I worked in Bell Atlantic, Goldman Sachs, Pfizer, JP Morgan, never saw guys working at the most upscale places that looked like these guys) just walked right in, flashed a badge and in.  <em>The employees who worked there couldn&#39;t even do this.</em></p>

<p>I had to be escorted by the company I was seeing everywhere I was in the building.  They themselves only had access to their own floor and no where else.  These contractors literally had 24/7 access to everywhere.  I mean everywhere.  The guys who were escorting me told me this.  <em>If you see them around, they&#39;re just doing maintenance, checking the building out, they can go anywhere at anytime.</em></p>

<p>I was being escorted in a hallway, and my escort left me outside while he went to get something quickly, and one of these contractors was right there on a ladder, working up into the ceiling.  I leaned over and looked up to see what he was doing, he was working directly on the steel joints of the building.  As I leaned, he got upset, and immediately gave me a look and came down the ladder.</p>

<p>So do I think that over a period of a few years, that some general contractors smuggled in explosives and planted them all over the WTC?  I don&#39;t know.  Is it possible?  Fuck yes it is.</p>

<p>In addition, I would like to point out, that it is bothersome that I never, ever heard anyone, a former employee, and investigator, anyone, even mention that this was going on in the WTC for a few years running before 9/11.  As far as I know, I am the only person who has witnessed this and speaks of it publicly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In or around 2003, I watched <del>watching</del> all the 911 documentaries I could find.  In one of them -- can&#39;t recall the name, but worth tracking down -- a British guy who worked in one of the WTC buildings spoke of exactly this: contractors coming and going at all hours, all over the building.  This British guy worked below a floor that was known to be an empty maintenance floor -- a place where equipment for maintaining the building was kept so it wouldn&#39;t always have to be lugged up from the basement.  This guy worked very late on a few occasions and heard what sounded like dumpsters being moved around above him.  It was a very compelling interview and your observations really reminded me of it.</p>

<p>marvin bush ran security for world trade center</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah i looked it up. It appears <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratesec">&quot;Marvin Bush, son of US president George H.W. Bush, and brother to US president George W. Bush, served on the board of directors from 1993- 2001.</a> &quot;</p>

<p>And &quot;At IPO in 1997, Securacom listed among its clients Washington Dulles International Airport, Hewlett-Packard, EDS, <strong>United Airlines</strong>, Gillette, MCI, <strong>the World Trade Center</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>I however could not find when Stratsec&#39;s contract with WTC or United started or expired, which is lame :C</p>

<p>But WOW, thanks for the info.</p>

<p>What a load of horseshit you&#39;ve been spewing.  If you actually did the research, you would see that Marvin Bush is indeed linked to a security contract with WTC.  However, saying that Marvin Bush was &quot;in charge of security of the towers&quot; is a complete lie.</p>

<p>Well,  I would argue that&#39;s probably an exaggeration of the available evidence or even an innocent mistake rather than a lie. Marvin was a principal at Securacom, but between 1999 and 2002, Bush&#39;s cousin, Wirt Walker III, was CEO. Hence, Bush&#39;s cousin was in charge of security at the WTC. At least, he was in charge of Securacom&#39;s responsibilities there.</p>

<p>There&#39;s some good info on it here:-</p>

<p>Responses: <strong>48% No Cover-up</strong> / <strong>42% Cover-up</strong> / 10% Not sure
&quot;World Trade Center Building 7 is the 47-story skyscraper that was not hit by any planes during the September 11th attacks, but still totally collapsed later the same day. This collapse was not investigated by the 9/11 Commission. Are you aware of this skyscraper&#39;s collapse, and if so do you believe that the Commission should have also investigated it? Or do you believe that the Commission was right to only investigate the collapse of the buildings which were directly hit by airplanes?&quot;
Responses: 43% Not Aware / 38% Aware - should have investigated it / 14% Aware - right not to investigate it / 5% Not Sure
&quot;Some people say that so many unanswered questions about 9/11 remain that Congress or an International Tribunal should re-investigate the attacks, including whether any US government officials consciously allowed or helped facilitate their success. Other people say the 9/11 attacks were thoroughly investigated and that any speculation about US government involvement is nonsense. Who are you more likely to agree with?&quot;
Responses: 47% Attacks were thoroughly investigated / 45% Reinvestigate the attacks / 8% Not Sure</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One poll that came close to asking that question was the Scripps Howard poll of July 2006, which asked how likely it was that the following sentence was true: &quot;Federal officials either assisted in the 9/11 attacks or took no action to prevent them because they wanted the United States to go to war in the Middle East.&quot; 59% said it was &quot;not likely,&quot; 20% said &quot;somewhat likely,&quot; and 16% said &quot;very likely.&quot; Presumably the other 5% weren&#39;t sure or refused to answer. That&#39;s similar to saying that 16% of the US population are confident it was an inside job, 59% are confident it was not, and the remaining 25% are unsure.</p>

<p>As Romney would say 40+% is hardly zero my friend.</p>

It bothers me that when people suggested that demolitions had been planted over time that so many nonchalantly say, <em>&quot;Impossible&quot;.</em>  I have always wondered about what weaknesses we have, and where they are.  How major capers or attacks happened, how they could happen again.  It pisses me off that this is thought of as impossible.  It took me a long time reading 9/11 conspiracy theories, and they didn&#39;t bother me.  Reptilians don&#39;t bother me, and all that nonsense.  But the reactions people gave to 9/11, are the same exact reactions I&#39;ve seen given about Reptilians.  The 2 should not be grouped together.  Is it possible there are Reptilians?  Yeah.  That&#39;s probably down around 0.0001%.  Is it possible to have snuck into the WTC and done that?  A far hell of a lot more than there are Reptilians.  I think people need to keep questioning things.  A democracy is based on a well-informed public that questions authority.  We are not doing this.  It is our duty to do so to keep our freedoms.  People are afraid to question things, that means something is seriously fucking wrong.</p>

<p>We are trained to respct and believe people in positions of authority from a young age. Check out youtube for tons of videos of people putting on an orange vest and hardhat and ordering random standgers around as if they had some authority. Almost everyone does what they say just because they&#39;re conditioned to do that.</p>

<p>All it would take to get access to the building like you said is a few confident people with the right badges and a call or two from a higher up and no one asks any questions. Hell, I remember in high school we had our entire computer lab stolen during broad daylight because the thiefs put on official looking clothes and acted like they were there to repair the computers. The staff literally let them walk out with the stuff.</p>

<p>Thea idea that thousands of people would have to be in on it or it would be some huge scam is not believable. How many people know enough about engineering or architecture to question what some guys are doing to the building?</p>

<p>You guys have both nailed it. Obviously it doesn&#39;t take thousands of people to wire a building for demolition. Not even professional demo crews use that many staff.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, once the deed was done it then became all about making sure the public stayed foolish and ignorant, and part of that strategy has been sending neo-Conservative Hasbara idiots into our internet forums to tell more lies, manipulate those they can, and harass those they can&#39;t. They use these arguments knowing full well that they&#39;re irrational, but their aim is deception so it doesn&#39;t particularly matter.</p>

<p>These guys have an actual plan to dominate internet content and to eliminate the platforms of those who expose them for the evil fucks that they are. </p>

<p>And although I have to sadly say I think they&#39;re winning the battle, the internet still scares them. If it didn&#39;t, then they wouldn&#39;t be recruiting people to manipulate forum content and media comment sections.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not just speaking the truth, but speaking directly to each other. Because of the internet, literally thousands of people can scour the world for all kinds of information and then bring it all together in places like this.</p>

<p>Remember that, back in 2001, when this was being planned (and it must surely have been planned well in advance) the internet was nowhere near the phenomenon it is today. Something tells me that the orches<em>traitors</em> of 9/11 were caught off guard by a few things.</p>

<p>One, that people would have doubts about the official story. Two, that so much evidence would come to light. Three, that regular people would be able to coordinate (via the internet) efforts to analyse that evidence: stuff like video, news reports, forensic data, conflicting official statements, laws of physics etc.</p>

<p>So what are we seeing right now? Efforts to gradually increase control over what can and can&#39;t be said online and continued efforts to discredit 9/11 truth seekers as &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot;.</p>

<p>Someone, somewhere is hoping to JFK the whole thing. Discredit everything and put out so many conflicting theories and false leads that nobody will ever be able to figure exactly out who did what.</p>

For the hard hat guy people trust he&#39;s there for their protection and don&#39;t want something to fall on them or the sidewalk to sink into the sewer as they walk over it, so they listen.</p>

<p>For a personal anecdote of people acquiescing to me in a position of non-authority:</p>

<p>When I was young I accidentally &quot;infiltrated&quot; a well-secured Halliburton campus (barbed wire, multiple checkpoints before entering building, roaming security).  </p>

<p>How?  I was delivering pizza.  To the wrong address.  Despite the fact that multiple security guards couldn&#39;t find the recipient in the directory they continued to usher me through their security post and wander around on my own.  At some point in my adventure the customer finally returned my call and I realized I was in the wrong place the whole time.</p>

<p>Just another anecdote to go along with your high-school story.  If you look the part, people will let you do your &quot;job&quot; with very little hassle: authority or not.</p>

<p>It is bred into us from the start. Parental / educational / institutional. My gf is a student at a horticulture college, and every single student there is very unhappy with the program and constantly complains. But no one would speak up about it, or say anything, just complain. So she took their complaints, put them in a list and submitted it as a suggestion for improvement in the course. Still, everyone but her remains silent and a couple have even chastised her for submitting it in the first place. </p>

<p>Unless we can overcome our fears and start looking at things as they are, rather than as we would hope they would be or as they have been presented to us by <em>authority</em>, we will remain a slave species, that&#39;s my opinion. I think we will, it is a growing process, but these manipulative events could not be run on a free people, they could only be run on those who have been enslaved body, and more importantly, mind. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think I have to as other users have posted a documentary of English workers who say the exact same thing.  But it&#39;s funny, because what would be &quot;proof&quot;?  I mean, do I need a selfie with an employee and the newspaper of the day?  Much of what I said is verifiable through various sources and already has been.  I don&#39;t feel the need to verify a damned thing, my point being you should keep an open mind, ask questions and research for yourself.  That if you do you can find out all of this, and even more that I witnessed alone.  I don&#39;t think I have any &quot;proof&quot; unless we all got together and called my previous employer, pretending to be a new employer that put them on my resume, and that still wouldn&#39;t necessarily prove that I was at the WTC.  They wouldn&#39;t answer such questions even if asked.  All it would prove was that I was employed as a service technician and that I serviced various customers of theirs all throughout the tri-state area.  Any evidence of me logging in when I arrived at the WTC is probably gone with the rubble, no trace or history besides a work order from my own company, which at this point and time is likely in the trash as well given they likely aren&#39;t a customer anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is really interesting.  What do you think about this.  I read that I believe it was Germany&#39;s Finance Minister not too long ago say publicly that their gold (across the street from the WTC in a bank) was gone on or before 9/11 they believed, because we weren&#39;t letting all these European countries withdraw any of it.  Then we lent the Ukraine recently (a few years after Germany said this) $100 Billion USD for $85 Billion of their gold reserve.  A week later we started sending European countries &quot;their&quot; gold back.  I mean is it really unrealistic to say that Die Hard 3 couldn&#39;t have happened?  They could have caused 9/11 specifically for this, or just saw the opportunity, anyone could have if they had the right equipment and access.  I had friends and friends of friends who helped clean up (and a few got various forms of cancer years later) and they said when they were there, there wasn&#39;t any real organization.  No one was in charge.  Again I don&#39;t necessarily believe this happened, but I understand it very well may have happened.  That a organization of people used 9/11 to steal gold from all the banks directly around the WTC, and I heard supposedly there was gold in the basement of the WTC itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not just the oil. It&#39;s about the currency used to trade for it. The petrodollar. </p>

<p>*In an effort to prop up the value of the dollar, Richard Nixon negotiated a deal with Saudi Arabia that in exchange for arms and protection they would denominate all future oil sales in U.S. dollars.[2] Subsequently, the other OPEC countries agreed to similar deals thus ensuring a global demand for U.S. dollars and allowing the U.S. to export some of its inflation.[citation needed] Since these dollars did not circulate within the country and thus were not part of the normal money supply, economists felt another term was necessary to describe the dollars received by petroleum exporting countries (OPEC) in exchange for oil, so the term petrodollar was coined by Georgetown University economics professor, Ibrahim Oweiss.</p>

<p>Because the United States was the largest producer and consumer of oil in the world, the world oil market had been priced in United States dollars since the end of World War II.[3] International oil prices were based on discounts or premiums relative to that for oil in the Gulf of Mexico.[4] But, although oil sales prior to 1973 were denominated in U.S. dollars, nothing precluded settlement in local currency.</p>

<p>In October 1973, OPEC declared an oil embargo in response to the United States&#39; and Western Europe&#39;s support of Israel in the Yom Kippur War, and this tension (and the new power of OPEC) led to fear that the dollar would become insignificant in the oil trade.*</p>

<p>It&#39;s also the Central Bank and the IMF. Libya, Syria, Iran all have their own banking system and the banking cartel doesn&#39;t like that. The Economic Sanctions against Iran are designed to collapse their Central Bank. It&#39;s economic warfare and when that doesn&#39;t do the job, send in the drones. We murdered Gadaffi because he wanted to unify Africa and Africa&#39;s Resources and only trade using the Gold Dinar, not the Petrodollar. That would have devastated the US Economy because of that whole outsourcing our inflation. If nation&#39;s stop using the Petrodollar, all of that inflation is going to be coming back this way. The BRIC nations are trying to get an alternative to the Petrodollar and the SWIFT processing system used by the West. Any nation that defies the Rothchild owned Central Bank/IMF can expect economic sanctions, false flag attacks, drone attacks, flyovers,  at this point, even if they do give in, we might just kill them anyways because these are some cold ass mother fuckers. Gaddafi was shanked in the ass with a knife in the streets and murdered like a dog. People still in our Government were good friends with him for years. Same with Saddam. One day, shaking hands with Ronald Reagan, the next, our military is digging you out of a shit, hidey hole and then he gets a mug shot, live on tv medical exam for shaming and then Hung by the Neck til&#39; Dead. Photo Ops. After Gaddafi was taken out, the 120 lbs of Gold in Libya was gone and the American backed Rebels immediately opened a Central Bank of Libya, allied with the IMF. Iraq was totally looted while we were there and after we left. Afghanistan, we took over the Oil Trade and the Opium Trade and made Billions.</p>

<p><strong>Urban Moving Systems, a &quot;possible fraudulent operation&quot; that exhibited &quot;little evidence of a legitimate business operation.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Israelis, &quot;visibly happy on nearly all&quot; of the photographs.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Urban Moving Systems, Israeli employee said, &quot;Give us twenty years and we&#39;ll take over your media and destroy your country&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Denials and deception over the alleged usage of a video camera.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Noticeably positive reaction demonstrated by the Israeli detainees to the explosions at WTC.</strong></p>

<p>Without being sarcastic, how often do you hear of people confessing to high level crimes that could be viewed as treason and quite possibly punishable with either the death penalty or life imprionment without hope of parole?  Never.</p>

<p>Also, these people are zealots.  Richard Helms went to his death saying nothing of what he knew about MK Ultra, the JFK assassination, etc.</p>

<p>Also, as pointed out, threats against one&#39;s own life or the lives of their family can be persuasive.</p>

<p>Like the JFK assassination, 9/11 tore at the heart of the United States.  How many people want to stand up and say, &quot;I was a part of that . . . but I&#39;m sorry now&quot;?  Nobody.  Read about how David Atlee Philips, E. Howard Hunt, Ruth Paine and others who were villified and shunned by their families due to the mere whiff that they were involved in the assassination conspiracy.</p>

<p>All of this said, there ARE people who are talking: William Rodriguez is a very important witness, Barry Jennings was before he died, as are many others who worked in WTC, witnessed things and lived to tell their stories.</p>

<p>It&#39;s unrealistic to think one of these contractors will come forward and confess.  And it&#39;s intellectually lazy (not accusing you, but some people <em>do</em> think like this) to believe, &quot;Well, <em>someone</em> would have come forward and confessed.  Since no one has, I guess there was no conspiracy.&quot;</p>

<p>EDIT: It&#39;s worth remembering that even the Watergate scandal, to this day nobody knows why the Republicans sought to plan listening devices in the Democratic National Committee&#39;s offices.  Theories abound, of course, but this is no conclusive explanation behind Watergate.  And it&#39;s shit definitely hit the fan of public consciousness and revealed more secret workings of the government than many ever wanted.  And still its purpose remains secret.</p>

<p>Yeah, don&#39;t be fooled by the faux incredulity of the trolls. Half a dozen or so well-trained demolitions specialists could have wired the WTC buildings with ease.

<p>I know 3 civil engineers who have worked on massive projects in large cities here and abroad, working with the biggest names in engineering for the construction and petroleum industries.  Engineers generally <em>love</em> talking about what they are doing, because they go home and they&#39;re work is so boring to their wives they don&#39;t get any attention otherwise.  These clean-cut people flashing badges were clearly <em>not</em> specialty civil engineers, but could have been forensic metallurgists.</p>

<p>Some documentary I saw over a decade ago had me thinking that when they updated the fire retardant sprayed onto the beams in the late 90s, that they had mixed in something like a stable relative of thermite or other incendiary thing.

I didn&#39;t see anything unusual when I looked up, a lot of networking wires I think and the sort, but that&#39;s not where I think they would have or put fire retardation, or sprinklers.  I would expect a civil engineer working with these general contractors to be dressed differently.  It was like they were all in uniforms.  A civil engineer would almost be a supervisor I would expect.  I don&#39;t know though, but that is interesting and possible.</p>

Think about how fucking hot it would be in there. Meanwhile, People were somehow able to stand directly in the &quot;crash&quot; damage in the building to wave to everyone. That alone tells me that that area was not really hot at all. But possible evidence suggests that the rest of the building was.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Coming from a background in EMS, I agree with you. Even so, the fact remains that the fire alarm system suffered damage in the bombing. Rather than just repair the damage, they began a complete overhaul of the system throughout the complex, deciding that the opportunity was there to replace and upgrade the pre-93 system that had been in place since a fire in the mid-70s. </p>

<p>The work was done in phases. Phase one was replacing the master fire alarm panel (Cerberus Pyrotronics MXL-V, Cerberus Pyrotronics MXL-VR remote transponder panels, and amplifier cabinets) between 1995-97. Phase two was transfering monitoring and control of the existing system over to the new one, and this work happened alongside the install of Phase 1. </p>

<p>Phase 3 was the replacement of <strong>all</strong> fire detection devices throughout WTC complex. None of this work in each individual building was any better than 80% complete on 9/11, and this is the ongoing work which I refer to in my earlier post. The system in place <em>was</em> opperational, it was a mix of older equipment with newer equipment gradually being installed and integrated. </p>

<p>There were work crews in and out of every nook, cranny, closet, and cubby hole of that complex between Feb &#39;93 and Sep &#39;01. This was taken advantage of a couple of years after the bombing when a mafia crew posed as a work crew on their way in to rob
the Bank of America that was in the North
Tower. </p>

<p>The sheer amount of explosives required to bring down such a massive structure, the sheer amount of planning, the sheer amount of thread required etc without one single witness to account for any of this just makes it very hard to believe. I mean, of course you can say it &quot;could&quot; have happened, but you could also say that the holocaust never happened and is all made up by jews, since it&#39;s in their interest for some reason. The evidence is all that matters.</p>

<p>None of this proves in any way that actual explosives were placed there. In fact, it doesn&#39;t even suggest it, and when put together with my other problems, it just makes it all the more unlikely. Again, maybe the jews orchestrated the holocaust to gain power over white people, or maybe not. The burden of proof remains on the ones doing the claims.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s assume that hundreds/thousands of secret &quot;workers&quot; managed to smuggle in tons of explosives, 10-100 kilometers of electronic wire without even a single witness finding out. It&#39;s a stupid idea that defies all evidence, but let&#39;s go with it for the sake of the argument. Even then, my second problem with this remains. You simply didn&#39;t hear any massive Bang before the collapse. An explosive of that multitude would be heard many miles away.

<p>I don&#39;t see what is so weird about that. A massive plane had just crashed in to the building, creating fire and explosions everywhere.

<p>Found it... but don&#39;t they explain this in the video?They atleast mention liquid metal(aluminium, most likely), which combined with oxygen or water can result in exothermic reactions way exceeding the required temperature. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTa_XL_k8fY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTa_XL_k8fY</a> This video? I didn&#39;t really find any evidence for Nano Thermite despite watching the entire video. All I could see was a guy claiming the only explanation for molten metal is thermite. That&#39;s his base premise which he bases his evidence on. It&#39;s a false premise... which leads me to your final point:</p>

</blockquote>

<p>First of all, it&#39;s not anyone elses job to disprove that it is steel, it is you(or anyone else who claims it&#39;s steel) that have to prove that it is steel.</p>

<p>It COULD be steel (just like there COULD exist a God or something), but it probably isn&#39;t, simply because of the meltingpoint of steel and aluminium. Steel melts at around 1400-1500 degrees Celcuis, while Aluminium melts at around 660 degrees Celcius. Big office-fires like the one in WTC can reach temperatures around 1000 degrees(even higher if the circumstances are favorable). Thus it is very likely it is molten aluminium and not molten steel.</p>

<p>But if you can prove it is steel and not some other metal, go ahead. If not, would you then agree that based on my facts above it is more likely aluminium or a similar metal dripping down?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Up above users posted a documentary of some Englismen, or an Englishman claiming very much, and even more of what was going on.  I don&#39;t know.  I&#39;m surprised not one person as far as I know never spoke publicly of this as well and that it never reached an outlet where more people were exposed to it like reddit or the news or whatever.  I think the reasoning could be, that the theory of explosives being planted isn&#39;t mainstream.  People in America know there are Conspiracy Theorists who believe something else caused 9/11, but not many people know <em>what</em> exactly they believe happened.  I think they were traumatized in a way that is similar to so many other things, a good portion of the whole country was, and I&#39;ll explain why.</p>

<p>I left my job that brought me to the WTC, not soon after I visited the WTC.  (They sent me there for servers because they wanted to keep me, they planned on sending me to get some SUN Microsystems training, which would have been amazing, except I didn&#39;t want to do it.)  I told me job after about a year, that eventually I planned on leaving for the Marine Corps, that I would give them notice, but I wasn&#39;t staying.  I was a dumb young kid, always wanted to join the military, family thing and all, go and fight the bad guys.</p>

<p>Fast forward a few years, I&#39;m coming back from my second deployment in 2005, I was at Camp Fallujah.  I was a Reservist in Brooklyn at a Communications Battalion.</p>

<p>So anyways, this is why I feel like everyone is traumatized and brainwashed because of 9/11.  Tunnels to Towers run, we went as a unit 20 or so Marines.  The former co-creator or creator of the Guardian Angels came up after all these politicians who spoke, he was the creator of that street vigilante group that used to fight crime.  He had the longest speech, he went on and on.  I&#39;ve never seen such a hate-filled speech in reality in my life, except on documentaries and tv.  This guy called for the extermination of Muslims worldwide.  He said we need to kill women and children in their homes, Muslim women and children.  He spoke the longest out of anyone, easily 10-15 minutes.  And you know what?  They applauded, they applauded like I&#39;ve never seen.  I just came back from Fallujah, and fighting against and for these people, and I was disgusted with what he said.  And here are all the crowd, all the politicians cheering for the extermination of all Muslims.  Never in all my life.  So as soon as they were done applauding I went on about how they were all fucking brainwashed, and it was horrible, and I was fucking loud about it.  I wanted everyone to hear, I just came back from Iraq and I wasn&#39;t as hateful as they were, and fuck them as Americans for being so.  It was literally like Nazi-Germany hit America.</p>

<p>People are outraged, they want revenge.  If you want another example of this, the black community is outraged right now over 1 person attacking them.  They&#39;re angry at everyone who isn&#39;t them, for the actions of one person.  It&#39;s the same exact thing.  Muslims as a whole are not responsible for the actions of a few.  No one group is responsible for the actions of 1 individual or a few individuals.</p>

<p>I hear you so much on this. 9/11 really changed my views about how far society has moved forward. When I used to do history class, our teacher would explain how in mainland Europe they used to have witch hunts, and if you were accused it was effectively the same thing as being declared guilty, since you&#39;d be murdered either way. He used to talk like humanity was still in the dark ages back then, but the reality is that it was only a few centuries ago. I don&#39;t think all that much has changed, except the nutcases in charge who are manipulating people to think insane things like this, now have access to communicative platforms that can cover the entire surface of the planet.</p>

<p>And even worse, the normal, sane people who want to tell you that you&#39;re being manipulated, don&#39;t have that access so they can&#39;t be heard. For centuries we had no voice or platform at all, and then along came the internet. For the first time all the people wondering why they have to endure this madness had a means to come together and speak out. </p>

<p>But now they are coming for the internet too, because it scares the shit out of them that people might organise themselves and spread information which is harmful to the status quo. This place is genuinely one of the last bastions of free thought left. You can&#39;t write anti-establishment stuff on mainstream media forums any more, and you can&#39;t even do it on most political forums. Where the rules themselves don&#39;t permit them to censor your words, they just use other means like falsely reporting your threads for abuse, downvoting you etc...</p>

<p>The bottom line is that if we lose the internet it&#39;s all over.</p>

<p>The important factor about the thermite is that it was military grade. It wasn&#39;t put there by al Qaeda. It was put there by someone who had access to the WTC buildings and to military grade thermite. Most likely these guys:-</p>

<p>My pleasure. </p>

<p>This is a fair point. It isn&#39;t beyond the realms of possibility that al Qaeda could get hold of military grade thermite, but there&#39;s also the matter of how they would have access to the WTC buildings in order to plant it, how they would know what they were doing (can&#39;t imagine any of them have demolished a high-rise skyscraper with thermite before), how they were able to get away without it being discovered by the authorities (i.e. NIST didn&#39;t test for explosives of any kind), and how they did all this despite most of their US-based members being under some type of domestic surveillance.</p>

<p>You have to apply Occam&#39;s Razor. You start with the most likely possibility and you work your way out if it doesn&#39;t fit. 9/11 being an exclusively al Qaeda operation is right out there at the fringes of the solar system. There are many more plausible theories to work through before you ever get to that one, and the one which is most probable (that it was funded by Saudi Arabia, and executed with the help of Mossad) has plenty of evidence to support it, as you can see exemplified above.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Well, I don&#39;t remember either of these two states being mentioned at the time. They were used later on by the US to justify the wars which the right wing wanted. The evidence we have against Israel extends specifically to the involvement of its intelligence services in the destruction of WTC buildings 1, 2 and 7.</p>

The DC Madame hung herself in a shed behind her house after just appearing on Alex Jones where she was specifically asked if she was planning on killing herself to which she replied, &quot;Absolutely not. If they find me dead, they murdered me.&quot; Barry Jennings was in WTC7 when the explosions started going off as he was trying to escape the building in the stairwell, there was a massive explosion that demolished the stairwell landing trapping him in the building. This happened before the Twin Towers came down. Barry was interviewed as soon as he escaped the building by a news crew and he talked about explosives in the building and then later gave the producers of Loose Change an interview, describing in detail the explosives and the damage. He then tried to rescind his permission for the interview before going into hiding and then winding up dead. </p>

<p>Also, the 9/11 Commission Members themselves, all stated that the Commission were not allowed to see evidence or interview certain witnesses such as Kalid Shiek Mohammed, who was the supposed &quot;Architect of 9/11&quot; and that the Commission was set up to fail.</p>

<p>9/11 COMMISSIONERS</p>

<p>The co-chairs of the 9/11 Commission (Thomas Keane and Lee Hamilton) said that the CIA (and likely the White House) “obstructed our investigation”.</p>

<p>The co-chairs of the 9/11 Commission also said that the 9/11 Commissioners knew that military officials misrepresented the facts to the Commission, and the Commission considered recommending criminal charges for such false statements, yet didn’t bother to tell the American people (free subscription required).</p>

<p>Indeed, the co-chairs of the Commission now admit that the Commission largely operated based upon political considerations.</p>

<p>9/11 Commission co-chair Lee Hamilton says “I don’t believe for a minute we got everything right”, that the Commission was set up to fail, that people should keep asking questions about 9/11, that the 9/11 debate should continue, and that the 9/11 Commission report was only “the first draft” of history.</p>

<p>9/11 Commissioner Bob Kerrey said that “There are ample reasons to suspect that there may be some alternative to what we outlined in our version . . . We didn’t have access . . . .”</p>

<p>9/11 Commissioner Timothy Roemer said “We were extremely frustrated with the false statements we were getting”</p>

<p>Former 9/11 Commissioner Max Cleland resigned from the Commission, stating: “It is a national scandal”; “This investigation is now compromised”; and “One of these days we will have to get the full story because the 9-11 issue is so important to America. But this White House wants to cover it up”.</p>

<p>9/11 Commissioner John Lehman said that “We purposely put together a staff that had – in a way – conflicts of interest“.</p>

<p>The Senior Counsel to the 9/11 Commission (John Farmer) who led the 9/11 staff’s inquiry, said “I was shocked at how different the truth was from the way it was described …. The tapes told a radically different story from what had been told to us and the public for two years…. This is not spin. This is not true.”</p>

How many people are we talking about, 200 workers?  I&#39;d say maybe as high as 500, but likely only about 300.  Who says they were all in on it?  What if it was just a team of say 15 guys in the group of 300, that worked the night shift.  Anything is possible, explosives over a plane is possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you have any idea how many top secret projects and programs there are in the United States? Not to mention all of the secret military operations that are conducted by the CIA, the Military and companies like Blackwater and Craft International. These operations carry on all day, every day and the people they have working on these projects and operations are highly trained and conditioned operatives that know how to keep a secret. Especially one this big. They don&#39;t hire people like us that have a conscious. They hire true believers that are executing a long term plan by the Shadow Government, the Banking Cartel, The Intelligence Agencies and the Military Industrial Complex. I&#39;m sure they look at the deaths of the innocent people on 9/11 the same way they look at collateral damage on the battlefield. They have no problem firing missiles into a wedding party filled with innocent men, women and children just to kill one guy. And then when the medics arrive to try and help the survivors, they fire another missile just in case any of the people helping them are part of their &quot;terrorist group&quot;.</p>

<p>Senator Paul Wellstone was one of Bush&#39;s biggest critics of the Iraq War and he was assassinated along with his wife and kids in a plane crash. 11 people died. Has anyone come forward due to their guilty conscious or some other reason? Nope. Has anyone come forward on JFK, RFK, MLK Jr.? Nope. Oklahoma City was another Inside Job. Watch Noble Lie <a href="https://youtu.be/UpNIMSDwvOw">https://youtu.be/UpNIMSDwvOw</a>. The news was reporting additonal bombs inside the building. The Bomb Squad removed some of these bombs but has anyone else besides the patsies come forward? 168 innocent men, women and children died that day and hundreds more were injured. What kind of people could carry out an operation like that murdering their own fellow Americans and never speak about it? The same kind of people that would plant explosives in the WTC.</p>

<p>On 9/11, 2 vans full of Israeli &quot;Students&quot;, several of whom worked for the Massad were stopped by the police and arrested. They were seen recording the WTC Attacks and dancing around on the roof of a parking garage and someone called the police. When they were pulled over on the George Washington Bridge, the police found explosives in the van, the videos of the attacks and lots of other incriminating evidence. All of it disappeared and the Israeli&#39;s were sent back to Israel and they appeared on Israeli TV talking about the arrest and the attacks. They obviously had foreknowledge and participated in some way. Did anyone come forward and talk? Nope.</p>

<p>I think you&#39;re in denial that truly evil people exist. And these people know that if they open their mouth, they&#39;ll be killed. Their families will be killed. Their lives would be destroyed if they weren&#39;t murdered or they might end up in prison for the rest of their lives for being a whistleblower just like Susan Lindauer or Sibol Edmunds.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a great article that discusses whistle blowers and why science trumps arm chair psychology. If the science proves beyond a doubt that the towers were demolished by explosives, it isn&#39;t thrown out because &quot;it&#39;s impossible because someone would have talked.&quot;</p>

<p>The manipulators we are arguing with have created the same fallacy. Even though it is strikingly obvious to anybody with half an iota of intellect that 9/11 was a false flag attack, they have nevertheless managed to create a social situation where saying it in public earns you either ridicule or verbal abuse.</p>

<p>You seriously believe the government or someone in the U.S. systematically planted explosives in the WTC over a period of time using how ever many construction workers it allegedly took. Only to then keep them there until two planes crashed into them and then blowing them. Oh and that the hundreds if not thousands of people that would have to be involved in this cover up would have stayed quiet for over a decade.

They would walk up, and security would quickly search inside bags, they recognized a lot of these people, so they let many go, especially if you were coming back and forth constantly.  During the rush hour in the mornings around 8-9am they had far more security working during these times checking.  They made all <em>visitors</em> empty their pockets and get a further search, just bags for everyone else.  The contractors literally would come in with these huge tool bags, in and out constantly.  They even had metal detectors, because maybe you remember the WTC bombing just a few years earlier?  Yeah, you sound like you&#39;re either a shill, or completely ignorant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you watch documentaries (and not necessarily the conspiracy ones) you&#39;ll see that security was very tight because of the past bombing.  Everyone knows this.  There were regular threats to bomb the WTC again, everyone knows this too.  You just seem like you personally have a problem with this and you&#39;re ignoring all the facts.  NYC and where you&#39;ve contracted at, completely different places.  I&#39;ve been all of the country and there isn&#39;t any place like NYC.  I don&#39;t think you have a fair comparison.  I worked in the government as well, not as a contractor, but all around contractors.  And even there they check bags and empty pockets, in a ton of places.  I really think you&#39;re just making that up.  I had a Security Clearance, because I left my job to join the Marine Corps.  Realize that also because of what I was specifically dealing with, theft was common as well.  We were dealing with expensive equipment, as well as sensitive data.  That&#39;s why I&#39;m pretty sure you&#39;re making up your whole story, because I&#39;ve been checked a few times, and to say it <em>never</em> happens...  I mean what did you contract for, farm equipment?</p>

<p>I did VIP support for my local provincial government at the legislature building, and even they didn&#39;t ask people to empty their pockets and bags.

<p>Hell, I work for law enforcement now and we still don&#39;t empty the pockets and bags of contractors. I have vendors from HP, Cisco, Microsoft and a bunch of other places come to our data center on a regular basis and they are never subjected to the kind of checks you&#39;re talking about. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those places aren&#39;t targets for these types of things that you&#39;ve been to, so there is no reason.  The WTC was regularly receiving threats of bombings for years before the bombings, and the years leading up to 9/11.  <em>Every single facility I&#39;ve been to, government or otherwise, that receives these types of threats has this amount of security.  If they receive regular threats this security is constant, because if you don&#39;t you can&#39;t afford insurance to cover anything.</em>  Being law enforcement, you should know this, my brother knows this being in ESU, we both learned this being Marines.  My brother used his own money to get security training specifically in this field to give him an edge to become ESU.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some of them were in on it and some of them were participating in the cover attack. For example, the Saudi&#39;s were providing support to the highjackers but it&#39;s highly unlikely that the planes were highjacked and flown into the buildings by the 19 terrorists as the Official Story claims. Same with the Pakistani ISI who wired $100k to Mohammed Atta the day before 9/11. The Mossad on the other hand were probably in on the real operation, which included explosive demolition of the WTC and the Pentagon. It&#39;s called Compartmentalization. That&#39;s how you can have thousands of people working on the atomic bomb but 99% of them have no idea what they are making because they are only allowed to work on their piece of the bigger project and they are not allowed to discuss their job with anyone, including their families. Then you have a certain percentage of the remaining 1% who have some idea of the bigger picture because their job is to take the work of the other 99% and put it all together. And then you have the planners at the top that know everything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, I&#39;ll take a stab. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>1) &quot;No clear explanation for the source of the sulfur has been identified.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The mission of the FEMA study was not to provide such a source. However, since then there have studies which have <a href="http://www.911myths.com/Sulfur.pdf">looked into this</a>, and come up with a number of possible sources, including the burning diesel oil in WTC7, or gypsum-based wallboard, heavily used in the main towers, which is close to 20% sulfur by weight. The analysis certainly does NOT &quot;proves that it was attacked by some form of munition.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2) The hijackers’ VISA applications.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hanlon&#39;s Razor: &quot;Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.&quot; For this to be any kind of evidence, you would need to show all other applications were processed correctly, and that similarly defective application submitted at the same time were rejected. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>3) &quot;Niaz Naik, a former Pakistani Foreign Secretary, was told by senior American officials in mid-July that military action against Afghanistan would go ahead by the middle of October.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I recommend Damian Cave&#39;s <a href="http://www.salon.com/2002/08/16/forbidden_truth/">detailed investigation</a> into this claim, which found plausible, if unproven, grounds for doubting Naik&#39;s recollection. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>4) Professor Niels Harrit published a peer-reviewed paper in 2009 proving the existence of high-energy thermite residue in four out of four WTC samples.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The &quot;peer-reviewed&quot; <em>Open Chemical Physics Journal</em> has a pretty dubious reputation. It&#39;s part of Bentham Science Publishers, which was one of the targets of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who%27s_Afraid_of_Peer_Review%3F">Who&#39;s Afraid of Peer Review</a> sting, in which papers which were literal nonsense got accepted. Another red-flag: no-one else has been able to reproduce Harrit&#39;s findings, an essential requirement in science. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>5) He notes that, on one video, Bin Laden wears golden rings on his fingers, an adornment banned among Wahhabi followers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m curious how he can tell metallic composition from a video. Also, note there are <a href="https://www.metabunk.org/attachments/ossamarings-jpg.6667/">plenty of other pics</a> showing OBL wearing a ring. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>6) Israeli intelligence were literally caught “dancing in celebration”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If &quot;dancing&quot; proves guilt, then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrM0dAFsZ8k">plenty of Arabs</a> were also guilty that day. There was never anything to tie these people to 9/11 and initial reports of explosives were <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100224011350/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2001/09/15/2001-09-15_blunders_mar_scoops_in_the_r.html">subsequently retracted as false</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>7) British university study confirms that 9/11 &quot;Conspiracy Theorists&quot; are the sane ones.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>TIL that frequency of posting on internet forums = a measure of sanity. And, moving RAPIDLY on...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>8) Cheney likely gave a direct order not to shoot down flight 77.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hmmm... The question quoted says, &quot;When you had <strong>that order</strong> given, I think it was by the president, that <strong>authorized the shooting down of commercial aircraft</strong> that were suspected to be controlled by terrorists, were you there?&quot; If Cheney said, &quot;the orders still stand,&quot; doesn&#39;t that mean he is CONFIRMING the ability to shoot down commercial aircraft, per the president&#39;s authorization? Am I missing where it says that &quot;the orders&quot; are NOT to shoot?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>9) Who really gained?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I completely agree that the government exploited the events of 9/11 enormously, including to ends that had nothing to do with it, such as the invasion of Iraq. But exploiting events for your own agenda in no way proves that you staged them: it&#39;s just political business as usual. If, as many contend, 9/11 was staged to invade Iraq, why was it apparently carried out by 19 Saudis? It would make much more sense to have evidence pointing at Iraq. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>10) The bodies of Phillip Marshall, his two children, and the family dog were found on February 2, and officials quickly determined it was a murder-suicide. But the Washington, D.C.-based Wayne Madsen Report (WMR) has found evidence that contradicts the official finding.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Marshall doesn&#39;t appear to have said anything particularly about 9/11 that many others haven&#39;t said. While the murder-suicide certainly appears suspicious, Marshall appears to have <a href="http://21stcenturywire.com/2013/02/28/philip-marshall-murder-suicide-a-lack-of-evidence/">moved in a number of other circles</a>, including drug-related ones, which might equally well have had an interest in silencing him. </p>

<p>OK, so this link proves that you&#39;re a liar.</p>

<p><strong>Alam claims that those behind the fake paper &quot;had also tried to do this earlier [sic] in a different journal, but failed in their attempt due to our peer review system. Our suspicions were aroused this time and in an effort to unmask their identities the normal publication process was carried out on the second fake article. When they received repeated requests from us for more information and their credit card and other payment details they withdrew this paper</strong></p>

<p>So, no fraud.</p>

<p>Your second link is a propaganda blog written by Hasbara toolbags like yourself, which rips off the Wiki template to give itself a false aura of credibility. It isn&#39;t even worth reading, so I didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Your smear attacks and lies against anybody and everybody who exposes the truth about your culture of evil doesn&#39;t really do anything except help us. You are just slinging as many false allegations as you can, backing them up with nothing. </p>

<p>You are willing to do or say anything to derail the conversation away from the science in Professor Harrit&#39;s paper, and it honestly makes me sick to my very stomach. You are worse than an animal. At least animals are honest.</p>

<p>This is an egregious lie, and is supported by literally nothing. Please show some evidence that it&#39;s a &quot;bad&quot; paper. Since &quot;bad&quot; is not a scientific term, you should either explain precisely what you think is wrong with the science in Harrit&#39;s paper or you should fuck off back to Israel.</p>

<p>Please include in your answer an explanation of why the paper is fully peer-reviewed, and why NIST&#39;s publication has not been peer-reviewed. I find it remarkably strange that the <em>only</em> peer-reviewed science concerning the events of 9/11 has come from people who claim the official story is false. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you have yet another miracle to explain that away though.</p>

<p>Bentham denies this entirely. Bentham claims it knew the paper was fraudulent and told the authors it had been accepted only to find out who they were so that they could report them to the police. </p>

<p>This is why I don&#39;t even bother arguing with most of you fools. When someone hands you a peer-reviewed chemistry paper, you think an acceptable response is to launch a (baseless) attack on the company that published it.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t even mind, if the smear wasn&#39;t so weak. It&#39;s pathetic. Your one line of attack against it is that story you keep spamming, which they bloody well deny in the first place! Tell me, should we ignore the entire contents of Wikipedia because it hosted a page about a fake war for nearly six years? Your attacks are as weak as they are completely irrelevant.</p>

<p>He didn&#39;t make any points. He made a series of generic slurs, smear attacks, false associations, circular fallacies, red herrings and straw man arguments. If you think I&#39;m wasting my time sifting through that bullshit then you&#39;re gravely mistaken. </p>

<p>An example of one of your &quot;points&quot; was a smear attack against the international publishing company which owns the journal that Professor Harrit&#39;s paper appeared in. Just what the fuck has that got to do with the content of Harrit&#39;s paper? It is irrelevant, unsubstantiated, and grossly disproportionate to the meaning you are trying to attach to it, given that hoax articles have also found their way into the same source you are trying to use to support the criticism.</p>

<p>You need to learn that a reply does not make an argument. And you need to stop arguing when someone presents you with facts. Arguing with facts makes you a liar, and nobody likes liars.</p>

<p>Yeah, I said that yesterday. Unfortunately when I got up today some other idiot had written me 2,000 words of lies about how and why peer-reviewed science isn&#39;t a reliable source of information.</p>

<p>Yeah, the problem is your initial premise is false. It&#39;s actually the reverse of the truth, and quite demonstrably so. After 9/11 happened, the government said there was a conspiracy of cave-dwelling Muslim extremists, and the possibility of that being true became theoretical at roughly the same time Rex Tomb admitted the FBI had absolutely no evidence supporting it.</p>

<p>Hence, the government told us to believe in an unsubstantiated theory about a conspiracy, and you&#39;re accusing me of being a conspiracy theorist for refusing.</p>

<p>I hope you can sympathise why your posts aren&#39;t really worth reading. They&#39;re just a total aberration of reality.</p>

<p>I know you won&#39;t read this either, because it doesn&#39;t gel with the reality distortion field that you operate within, but a man can dream. </p>

<p>Look. I know exactly how you feel. I can put myself in your shoes. I know that you know with utter certainty that the official 9/11 narrative is a complete fabrication. That people like me are at best idiots, and at worst paid government shills. </p>

<p>The problem is that I also know with utter certainty that everything you think about 9/11 is wrong, stupid, and ignorant. I know that your narcissistic belief that you are smarter than society and are thus able to see a truth that the rest of us are blind to is motivating your stupid 9/11 conspiracy. </p>

<p>We both KNOW we&#39;re right, despite having mutually exclusive views. One of us is wrong. Your refusal to debate the evidence presented in opposition to your views is an implicit concession that your argument is weak and not borne out by the facts. It&#39;s not enough to dismiss an argument out of hand when they present you with perfectly valid points that you have yet to refute with any facts or evidence of your own. </p>

<p>You seem to be asking us to believe that the quality of a paper the EIC didn&#39;t read was the reason for her resignation. But how can that  be if she didn&#39;t read it? Clearly, you are being purposefully deceitful.</p>

<p>If Harrit&#39;s paper was wrong then why did she not simply refuse to publish it? She was the editor after all. She claims she hasn&#39;t read the paper, and cites political reasons for her resignation, which in everything other than the mind of an idiot, means she was pressured out of her job.</p>

<p>But you seem to be saying it&#39;s all a big coincidence that every single academic who comes forward with evidence the government lied is either fired, forced into retirement, or resigns. Kevin Ryan? Steven Jones? </p>

<p>All of these scientists are mad are they? And they all suddenly went mad after 9/11? With exactly the same illness? And presumably one of the symptoms of that illness is to produce scientific research proving the government lied. Right?</p>

<p>You make me sick. You really do. It doesn&#39;t matter what you are presented with, you simply ignore it all and keep repeating the same retarded fallacies back. It&#39;s like trying to argue against someone who denies the existence of the Sun, or his own nose.</p>

<p>Stop fucking lying. She said in her opinion the paper had been submitted to prove a political point.</p>

<p><strong>The editor in chief of the journal where recently the paper: &quot;Active Thermitic Material Discovered in Dust from the 9/11 World Trade Center Catastrophe&quot; was published, resigned, claiming she wasn&#39;t informed of the publication. She proceeds to provide not a single solid scientific rebuttal, only administrative bickering and personal political bias against, well.. inconvenient science. One particularly notable comment attributed to Ms. Pileni is this one: &quot;Marie-Paule Pileni points out that because the topic lies outside her field of expertise, she cannot judge whether the article in itself is good or bad.&quot;.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Strangely, her areas of research seem to contradict that.</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://911blogger.com/node/19963">http://911blogger.com/node/19963</a></p>

<p>And here is the exact quote from her corrupt, lying ass:-</p>

<p><strong>“I cannot accept that this topic is published in my journal. The article has nothing to do with physical chemistry or chemical physics, and I could well believe that there is a political viewpoint behind its publication</strong></p>

<p>Neither, for that matter, did Bentham publishing.

<p>But no she didn&#39;t. You&#39;re just making things up, you silly troll. That claim directly contradicts the quote I just posted from her. She said she resigned because the paper wasn&#39;t chemical physics and because the political implications were unsettling.</p>

<p>What a total crock of shit. It isn&#39;t the editor&#39;s job to peer-review scientific work. The papers are peer-reviewed before they get to her. Do you even have an iota of an idea how the scientific process works, you complete rent-a-muppet?</p>

<p>Again, you have simply made this up. Again, it directly contradicts the quote I just posted from her. She said she had not read the paper and that it lay outside her field of expertise -- which is demonstrably untrue. Hence, there is another reason why she resigned than the one she gave.</p>

<p>Why do you come here and just make stuff up, you insane little hairy big nose? You falsely accuse the paper of not being peer-reviewed, while you simultaneously tout a discredited piece of propaganda from NIST which hasn&#39;t been peer-reviewed. </p>

<p>&quot;Bambang Parmanto, a University of Pittsburgh information scientist, resigned from his editorship at The Open Information Science Journal (TOISCIJ) after reading a story on The Scientist&#39;s website [on June 10] that described a hoax paper submission to the journal. Editors at the journal claimed to have peer reviewed the article and slated it for publication pending the submission of $800 in &quot;open access fees.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I didn&#39;t like what happened,&quot; Parmanto told The Scientist. &quot;<strong>If this is true, I don&#39;t have full control of the content that is accepted to this journal</strong>.&quot; Parmanto said that <strong>he had never seen the phony manuscript that was accepted by TOISCIJ</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>Seems like Bentham has a habit of doing this kind of shit.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s see what the editor in chief that replaced Pileni said about the paper in question:</p>

<p>&quot;1) I was not editor of the journal at the time the manuscript you refer to was received and processed. I was not involved in its handling, and <strong>in no way do i agree with its conclusions. In fact i do not even know how the paper&#39;s peer reviewing was handled - or if it was reviewed at all. The journal never wanted to disclosed this matter to me</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What may be even worse - <strong>noone seems to be at the helm of this Journal</strong>. Months ago -simply after becoming acquainted with the article you mention, its possible misshandling, etc- <strong>i submitted my immediate resignation as editor to the open chemical physics journal</strong>. As you can see from the email below, my letter of resignation was received and acknowledged. <strong>However, i still appear as the journal&#39;s editor - in fact i&#39;m still receiving manuscripts to handle (which i naturally ignore)</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>To be frank, noone seems to be at the helm of this floundering ship</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>Yup, that&#39;s a real reputable organization.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>She said she resigned because the paper wasn&#39;t chemical physics and because the political implications were unsettling.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“<strong>They have printed the article without my permissio</strong>n, so when you wrote to me, <strong>I did not know that the article had appeared. I cannot accept this, and therefore I have written to Bentham that I resign from all activities with them</strong>”</p>

<p>Let&#39;s check Bentham&#39;s own website to see if we can figure out the role the editor in chief plays in the review process:</p>

<p><a href="http://benthamscience.com/editorial-policies-main.php">http://benthamscience.com/editorial-policies-main.php</a></p>

<p>&quot;All submitted articles/eBook chapters are <strong>subjected to an extensive peer review in consultation with members of the journal’s editorial board and independent external referees</strong> (usually three reviewers).

<p>The review is done IN CONSULTATION WITH THE JOURNAL&#39;S EDITORIAL BOARD.</p>

<p>This is just completely unbelievable. I asked you to prove your fake claim that the editor of the Open Chemical Physics Journal didn&#39;t know what was in her own journal, and you&#39;ve (in bold, no less) posted a quote from a different editor, about a completely different journal, which has absolutely no relationship with either Professor Harrit or the editor/topic under discussion. </p>

<p>You&#39;ve just <em>completely</em> changed the subject you hilarious liar. Literally the only relationship between these two publications is that they are both owned by Bentham Publishing, an international company that owns 346 different academic journals.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I was not editor of the journal at the time the manuscript you refer to was received and processed. I was not involved in its handling.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And so how would he know there was any problem with its handling? The only source he would have is Pileni, who has demonstrably not been honest about her reasons for leaving. You&#39;re trying to support a false claim made by Pileni with the private concerns of a man who later heard about it and got worried. These comments you&#39;ve posted were sent in a private email, and they were stolen and posted publicly.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what he later wrote:-</p>

<p><strong>While i sympathize with your arguments, I have noticed with worry, however, that you have posted in an open web site my email response of yesterday to you and to the journal. I sent that email under the reasonable assumption that i was corresponding with you in privacy. A privacy that i see violated by your posting of my message in a blog without asking for my prior consent. Please remove it from your blog site -together with any comments you have associated with that message</strong></p>

<p>So it seems he now wants to distance himself from those comments and is not prepared to support them publicly. </p>

<p>In fact, I know from personal experience that Zionist deceivers are very fond of asking leading questions in private and then posting selective responses in public. They also deliberately obscure the context of the conversation and whether the comments were tailored specifically for the person who received them (i.e. whether you really meant them). </p>

<p>The other major weakness with your smear attack is that there were precisely <em>zero</em> issues with either the journal or its editorship before Harrit&#39;s 2009 paper, which again lends support to the contention that it has been targeted because it published something the Zionists didn&#39;t like.</p>

<p>But I digress. Here is what Professor Griscom, one of the actual peer-reviewers for Professor Harrit&#39;s paper had to say in a public statement:-</p>

<p><strong>&quot;II. The 2009 publication in The Open Chemical Physics Journal (TOCPJ) of a fabulous paper by Harrit et al. entitled “Active Thermitic Material Discovered in Dust from the 9/11 World Trade Center Catastrophe” Some disparagers of the 9/11 Truth movement have alleged that TOCPJ is a place on the web where anybody can buy a publication without peer review. Absolutely false! I know this because I was one of the referees of the Harrit et al. paper. The editors asked for my opinion. And after about two weeks of studying what the authors had written, checking relevant references, and gathering my thoughts, I finally provided my advice to authors in 12 single-spaced pages, together with my recommendation to the Editors that they publish the paper after the authors had considered my suggestions. Still, some skeptical readers may ask how anyone can rate a scientific paper as “fabulous.” Well, I am the principal author of 109 papers (and a co-author of an additional 81) in peer-review journals. And have refereed a least 600, and possibly as many as 1000, manuscripts. So you would be right in calling me an aficionado of articles published in scientific journals. And I found absolutely nothing to criticize in the final version of the Harrit et al. paper! Apropos, twelve of my own publications have appeared in the American Institute of Physics’ Journal of Chemical Physics (an old fashioned paper journal), so it is accurate to say that chemical physics (of inorganic materials) is my main specialty.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://911blogger.com/news/2010-12-02/peer-reviewer-active-thermitic-materials-paper-identifies-himself-great">http://911blogger.com/news/2010-12-02/peer-reviewer-active-thermitic-materials-paper-identifies-himself-great</a></p>

<p>Hence, this again torpedoes the smear attacks you are using, because it proves that the unsupported allegations you are making about the peer review process for this paper are false. You are just simply making them up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What may be even worse - noone seems to be at the helm of this Journal</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hang on, isn&#39;t that supposed to be his own job? He&#39;s the editor. You don&#39;t get much more at the helm than that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yup, that&#39;s a real reputable organization</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The organization you keep smear-attacking has no direct relationship to the quality of science in Harrit&#39;s paper, so please stop using dirty political tactics and false allegations to attack scientific research you cretinous dog.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All submitted articles/eBook chapters are subjected to an extensive peer review in consultation with members of the journal’s editorial board and independent external referees</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, do you have any supporting evidence that this process was not followed with Harrit&#39;s paper?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and the decision based on all the peer reviewers&#39; comments, taken by the journal’s Editor-in-Chief/eBook Editor is then conveyed to the author(s)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, Professor&#39;s Griscom&#39;s response proves that this process was indeed followed, and quite rigorously.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The review is done IN CONSULTATION WITH THE JOURNAL&#39;S EDITORIAL BOARD.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And again, I asked you for proof that this was not the case with this paper. You have shown no such thing and I have further disproved the allegation by posting Professor Griscom&#39;s confirmation that he did indeed have regular consultations with the editorial board.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I gotta be honest, It&#39;s a lot of fun making antisemitic retards like you look stupid.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Like The 9/11 Commission Report, the NIST reports were not peer-reviewed.</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.consensus911.org/references-evidence-based/">http://www.consensus911.org/references-evidence-based/</a></p>

<p>Hence, there is categoric proof that none of your comments should be taken seriously, or even read for that matter. You&#39;re trying to defend a fraudulent paper which hasn&#39;t had any type of peer-review, by making false claims about a paper which has been fully peer-reviewed, and your line of attack is that we should completely ignore the paper because you say it hasn&#39;t been properly peer-reviewed. If I didn&#39;t know how serious your Zionist cult is about lying and deceiving others, I&#39;d be laughing at the sheer irony of your idiotic words.</p>

<p>You are nothing except cowards and monsters who murdered 3,000 Americans. That&#39;s a fact. And I would literally strangle you with my bare hands if I could get away with it, you subhuman piece of verminous filth. If you want to think that makes me an anti-Semite then go right ahead and think it. I prefer to see myself as anti-evil.</p>

<p>So 2 different editors in chief resign over the same piece of trash paper, and you think that&#39;s kosher?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve already debunked all of your lies, you silly Hasbara toolbag. Why are you still replying to me? </p>

<p>You keep insisting that both editors resigned because of the paper, and you are deliberately obfuscating that they did not resign because of the quality of its scientific content, but because of the political ramifications on their careers. They wanted nothing to do with it because it was a political hot potato and you can be damned sure that the Zionists have tried to ruin the reputation of anybody associated with it. Just look at what you are doing right now for proof of that, mate. Professor Harrit is a university professor at the University of Copenhagen, and has been a doctor of chemistry for over 20 years, but there are Hasbara websites all over the internet trying to convince people that he&#39;s some type of retard.</p>

<p>All of your lies are debunked by Professor Griscom coming forward and identifying himself as a peer-reviewer. And they are absurd to begin with given that neither the NIST investigation nor the 9/11 commission has ever been peer-reviewed. Your double standards and your disingenuous smear attacks betray your disinformation for exactly what it is I&#39;m afraid. To everybody with even half an iota of intellect.</p>

<p>You are just an evil little runt who doesn&#39;t deserve the right to life.</p>

<p>Are you really accusing peer-reviewed science of being a conspiracy theory you utter twat? The peer-reviewers will have had full access to Harrit&#39;s samples so you&#39;re just fucking making stuff up again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure if you posted it already or not, but here&#39;s another peer reviewed, published paper that provides evidence for thermite that the faithers can&#39;t seem to debunk.</p>

<p><a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10669-008-9182-4">http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10669-008-9182-4</a></p>

<p>&quot;The occurrence of such extreme, sharp spikes in VOCs in air at GZ indicate something other than the behavior of a typical structure fire. Oxygen influx as a result of shifting of materials within the pile might have created an increase in combustion of material in localized areas. But these spikes in VOCs, at levels thousands of times higher than seen in other structure fires, suggest extremely violent but short-lived fire events. Probably the most striking spike in toxic air emissions, found in EPA monitoring data, occurred on 9th February, 2002. Note (Table 1 ) that this was nearly 5 months after 9/11, and after nearly all the debris had been cleared from GZ. In fact, the levels of some species, like toluene and styrene, were some of the highest observed at the site. But the levels of benzene and propylene detected on that day were far above previous measurements, at 610,000 and 990,000 ppb, respectively. Other VOCs were measured at their peak levels on this date, including 1,3-butadiene at 400,000 ppb.&quot; &quot;EPA also monitored very fine particulate matter (PM) and other sizes of PM. PM is probably the most reliable indicator for the activity of structure fires, as such fires are generally known to burn incompletely, and produce PM that drifts up and outward from the source. EPA data from the West Broadway sampling site, the location closest to GZ where PM was monitored, show the following trend in very fine PM (PM 2.5 , or all particles \ 2.5 l m) in October and November 2001 (Fig. 4 ). These data show that the peaks in levels of very fine PM near GZ correspond to different dates than the peaks for the previously discussed combustion products. The five stron- gest peaks in PM 2.5 levels are centered on 23th, 26th September, and 3rd, 10th, 20th October, closer in time to the events of 9/11. None of these dates correspond to the dates of five peaks in VOCs noted above. Additionally, it is clear that the levels of PM 2.5 emissions rose more gradu- ally, and died down more gradually, indicating slower fire dynamics as might be expected from the burning of the organic materials previously thought to exist in the WTC. These data suggest that the greatest level of fire activity, associated solely with the typical fuel sources expected in the WTC, was completed by the third week of October. That is, the materials expected to burn (incompletely) in a structure fire, producing PM, were largely burned off by mid- to late-October. Therefore, the extreme spikes in air concentrations of the five VOCs noted above, particularly on 3rd, 8th November, and 9th February, point not to other sources of typical combustible materials but to other forms of com- bustion. Such forms of combustion appear to be violent and short-lived, and thus similar to the effects of energetic materials, like thermite&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Bentham Science publishes a large number of journals, a quick google search gives this info:</p>

<p>&quot;Bentham Science Publishers Ltd. Home Page
&quot;A major STM journal publisher of 92 online and print journals, 200 plus open accessjournals, and related print/online book series, &quot;</p>

<p>Each journal has an a different editorial board, as far as I can see. So an error by someone on ONE of 200-plus journals has very close to zero bearing on what is published in the other 200 journals. The problem was not in the Open Chemical Physics Journal.</p>

<p>Further, our Active Thermitic Material paper was reviewed prior to publication by the Chair of the Department of Physics and Astronomy at BYU -- and he approved it for publication after his suggested changes were made by the authors (including myself). His peer-review was NOT under the auspices of Bentham. (This &quot;extra&quot; peer-review was done because two of the authors are from this dept. at BYU... and Dr. Farrer requested the review.)</p>

<p>No, someone presented a baseless smear attack which you are now bizarrely labelling as &quot;evidence&quot;.</p>

<p>And given that the official story involves a conspiracy of Muslims, I don&#39;t quite know how you think a conspiracy didn&#39;t occur. Are you saying a conspiracy of Muslims isn&#39;t a conspiracy, but a conspiracy of Zionist Jews is?</p>

<p>You attack this one point (and don&#39;t acknowledge the editor-in-chief resigned over the article being published)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, it appears it is you who does not acknowledge that she did not resign over the quality of the paper, but rather because she was put under political pressure to do so. Just like EVERY ACADEMIC who has come forward has been put under political pressure.</p>

<p><strong>After the paper entitled &quot;Active Thermitic Material Discovered in Dust from the 9/11 World Trade Center
Catastrophe,&quot; which I along with eight colleagues co-authored, was published in the Open Chemical Physics
Journal, its editor-in-chief, Professor Marie-Paule Pileni, abruptly resigned. It has been suggested that this
resignation casts doubt on the scientific soundness of our paper.</strong></p>

<p><strong>However, Professor Pileni did the only thing she could do, if she wanted to save her career. After resigning, she did not criticize our paper. Rather, she said that she could not read and evaluate it, because, she claimed, it lies outside the areas of her expertise.</strong></p>

<p><strong>But that is not true, as shown by information contained on her own website (<a href="http://www.sri.jussieu.fr/pileni.htm">http://www.sri.jussieu.fr/pileni.htm</a>).</strong></p>

<p><strong>Her List of Publications reveals that Professor Pileni has published hundreds of articles in the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology. She is, in fact, recognized as one of the leaders in the field. Her statement about her ”major advanced research” points out that, already by 2003, she was ”the 25th highest cited scientist on nanotechnology” (<a href="http://www.sri.jussieu.fr/pileni.htm">http://www.sri.jussieu.fr/pileni.htm</a>).</strong></p>

<p><strong>Since the late 1980s, moreover, she has served as a consultant for the French Army and other military
institutions. From 1990 to 1994, for example, she served as a consultant for the Société Nationale des Poudreset Explosifs (National Society for Powders and Explosives).</strong></p>

<p><strong>She could, therefore, have easily read our paper, and she surely did. But by denying that she had read it, she avoided the question that would have inevitably been put to her: ”What do you think of it?”</strong></p>

<p><strong>Indeed, the very fact that she offered no criticisms of it provided, implicitly, a positive evaluation---an
acknowledgement that its methodology and conclusions could not credibly be challenged.</strong></p>

<p>This is precisely why I won&#39;t argue with you. Because you&#39;re a liar. Your game is just to accuse me of whichever fallacies you yourself are using and hope the truth gets lost in the crossfire.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The poster&#39;s point against the article</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The poster made no point against the article. He made a smear attack against the international company which published it.  He wasn&#39;t even referring to the same journal as the one Harrit used. Harrit used the Open Chemical Physics Journal, and the (baseless) allegation from the other poster was about a computer science journal.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why has no one else had these findings?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because nobody else has tested the samples. Why are you ignoring that the paper has passed peer review? You just reek of sheer desperation to attack everything about this paper except the actual science within it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Damn, there&#39;s so much misinformation in your responses, I don&#39;t even know where to begin. I guess I&#39;ll just go down the list.</p>

<ul>
<li>1) &quot;No clear explanation for the source of the sulfur has been identified.&quot;
The mission of the FEMA study was not to provide such a source. However, since then there have studies which have looked into this, and come up with a number of possible sources, including the burning diesel oil in WTC7, or gypsum-based wallboard, heavily used in the main towers, which is close to 20% sulfur by weight. The analysis certainly does NOT &quot;proves that it was attacked by some form of munition.&quot;*</li>
</ul>

<p>It wasn&#39;t just the sulfur, it was also the condition of the steel that was the reason for the conclusion that it was attacked by some form of munition.</p>

<p>Also, the diesel fuel in the storage tanks did not burn or contribute to the fires in any way. In fact, all of it spilled out and had to be cleaned up.</p>

<p><em>&gt; 2) The hijackers’ VISA applications.
Hanlon&#39;s Razor: &quot;Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.&quot; For this to be any kind of evidence, you would need to show all other applications were processed correctly, and that similarly defective application submitted at the same time were rejected.</em></p>

<p>An extensive investigation has been conducted on the Express Visa Program and the US Embassy that processed all of the Visas for the alleged 9/11 Highjackers. It had nothing to do with stupidity. </p>

<p>Richard Armitage, Frank Carlucci, Marc Grossman and Grant S. Green were in charge of the Embassy and approval of the Express Visa Program. They also have ties to Government Contracters including the Carlyle Group. Their activities on 9/11 are also highly suspicious of complicity in the attacks. Here is an excellent article that goes into great detail of their involvement in the program and the program itself.</p>

<p><a href="http://digwithin.net/2012/04/08/911-as-a-sequel-to-iran-contra/">http://digwithin.net/2012/04/08/911-as-a-sequel-to-iran-contra/</a></p>

<p><em>&gt; 4) Professor Niels Harrit published a peer-reviewed paper in 2009 proving the existence of high-energy thermite residue in four out of four WTC samples.
The &quot;peer-reviewed&quot; Open Chemical Physics Journal has a pretty dubious reputation. It&#39;s part of Bentham Science Publishers, which was one of the targets of the Who&#39;s Afraid of Peer Review sting, in which papers which were literal nonsense got accepted. Another red-flag: no-one else has been able to reproduce Harrit&#39;s findings, an essential requirement in science.</em></p>

<p>First of all, the NIST Report was not peer reviewed and they refuse to release the computer models used to arrive at their conclusion for the collapse of Building 7. They have no explanation for the free fall speed of the collapse and they have never been able to reproduce jet fuel melting steel beams in a lab. No one has and several independent tests have been conducted attempting to reproduce the effect to no avail.</p>

<p>Anyone that has tried to dispute the Government Version of events is fired. Kevin Ryan at UL, Steven Jones</p>

<p><em>&gt;5) He notes that, on one video, Bin Laden wears golden rings on his fingers, an adornment banned among Wahhabi followers.
I&#39;m curious how he can tell metallic composition from a video. Also, note there are plenty of other pics showing OBL wearing a ring.</em></p>

<p>There are dozens of reasons to believe that the Bin Laden Confession Video was fake.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/did-osama-bin-laden-confess-to-the-9-11-attacks-and-did-he-die-in-2001/18923">http://www.globalresearch.ca/did-osama-bin-laden-confess-to-the-9-11-attacks-and-did-he-die-in-2001/18923</a></p>

<p><em>6) Israeli intelligence were literally caught “dancing in celebration”.
If &quot;dancing&quot; proves guilt, then plenty of Arabs were also guilty that day. There was never anything to tie these people to 9/11 and initial reports of explosives were subsequently retracted as false.</em></p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t the dancing that proved guilt so much as the arrest of these Israeli&#39;s on the George Washington Bridge in a van full of explosives. There were actually two vans, one of them had explosives and the other one was blown up by the occupants of the van as they were escaping. The Vans were from a company called Urban Moving Systems and they had a mural painted on the side showing the Twin Towers with a plane flying into them on fire. The Israeli&#39;s that were arrested were Mossad Agents and not only did the vans and all of the evidence disappear but the Israeli&#39;s were not charged and were sent back to Israel. They later appeared on Israeli TV where they told the interviewer that they were there to document the event. That means they had foreknowledge of the attacks and considering the fact that the vans were full of explosives, they were obviously not just there to document, they were there to participate. I believe this is one of the biggest smoking guns of 9/11.</p>

<p><em>8) Cheney likely gave a direct order not to shoot down flight 77.
Hmmm... The question quoted says, &quot;When you had that order given, I think it was by the president, that authorized the shooting down of commercial aircraft that were suspected to be controlled by terrorists, were you there?&quot; If Cheney said, &quot;the orders still stand,&quot; doesn&#39;t that mean he is CONFIRMING the ability to shoot down commercial aircraft, per the president&#39;s authorization? Am I missing where it says that &quot;the orders&quot; are NOT to shoot?</em></p>

<p>If the order was to shoot down the plane, then why was it not carried out? They had plenty of time, they knew exactly where the plane was and they had the assets to do it. But judging by the way the question was worded by the assistant, you have to assume that the order was NOT to shoot the plane down. This one is pretty much speculation so there is no way to prove anything one way or the other without an admission of guilt from someone.</p>

<p><em>9) Who really gained?
I completely agree that the government exploited the events of 9/11 enormously, including to ends that had nothing to do with it, such as the invasion of Iraq. But exploiting events for your own agenda in no way proves that you staged them: it&#39;s just political business as usual. If, as many contend, 9/11 was staged to invade Iraq, why was it apparently carried out by 19 Saudis? It would make much more sense to have evidence pointing at Iraq.</em></p>

<p>Why did we invade Afghanistan if the highjackers were all Saudi?</p>

<p><em>10) The bodies of Phillip Marshall, his two children, and the family dog were found on February 2, and officials quickly determined it was a murder-suicide. But the Washington, D.C.-based Wayne Madsen Report (WMR) has found evidence that contradicts the official finding.
Marshall doesn&#39;t appear to have said anything particularly about 9/11 that many others haven&#39;t said. While the murder-suicide certainly appears suspicious, Marshall appears to have moved in a number of other circles, including drug-related ones, which might equally well have had an interest in silencing him.</em></p>

<p>Well atleast you aren&#39;t denying that he was murdered. Again, more speculation. We have no idea who murdered him but if it wasn&#39;t the Government and it was suspected that he was murdered, why would the cops call it a murder/suicide? Also, shortly after his death, FBI Agents showed up at his house and removed all of his computers and boxes of other evidence. Who gave them permission to do that? Why were they taken if it was in fact a murder/suicide? Case closed so there should be no reason to take his stuff. They obviously wanted whatever information he had.</p>

<p>Wahhabists are forbidden to wear ANY jewelry, including gold, or silk. Any exhibition of wealth is banned. Hence, which metal they were doesn&#39;t matter, only that the man in the video pretending to be OBL was wearing them. There are not plenty of other pics showing Osama wearing a ring. Not before 2001, in any case.</p>

<p>The poster is a liar. No doubt another Zionist dog.</p>

You should read a bit more about bin Laden before you start telling people they are wrong.</p>

<p>Resorting to making stuff up? I have found zero references to Roger Hardy being the &quot;world&#39;s foremost bin Laden expert&quot;, not even in your own link. As far as I can see, he is just a Middle East correspondent. As well, this was 19 days after the attack and we now know a hell of a lot more about him than we did at that moment.</p>

<p>And as far as your assertion that I am making up stories, it is a little funny that you would make that expert claim and accuse me of making shit up, but let&#39;s just walk through this.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qutbism">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qutbism</a></p>

<p>Just going over the basics of this branch of Islam, It shares a shocking amount of similarities to how al Qaeda actually behave especially with regards to jihad, because Wahhabism needs the leader to call for jihad instead of just anyone. It is also very interesting to note that bin Laden regularly attended lectures from Mohammed Qutb, brother of Sayyid.</p>

<p>Here is Karen Armstrong, who has wrote several books about Islam and would know a bit about the different sects, claiming that bin Laden was more influenced by Qutb than Wahhabi ideology. She also goes into why it&#39;s important that we actually look into the true influences behind this type of thinking, so there is also stuff about the IRA that isn&#39;t important to this particular point.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/jul/11/northernireland.july7">http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/jul/11/northernireland.july7</a></p>

<p><a href="https://sinningslave.wordpress.com/2006/10/03/is-osama-bin-laden-really-a-wahhabi/">https://sinningslave.wordpress.com/2006/10/03/is-osama-bin-laden-really-a-wahhabi/</a></p>

<p>This is also a pretty good essay on the roots of bin Laden&#39;s faith. It is a good read, but I will admit not terribly well sourced. It does fit in line with other pieces of evidence.</p>

<p>Lastly, even the beliefs and ideology section on Wiki, which is heavily sourced in this case, makes no mention of him being Wahhabi.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osama_bin_Laden#Beliefs_and_ideology">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osama_bin_Laden#Beliefs_and_ideology</a></p>

<p>The full article also explains his differences from Wahhabi ideology. He wasn&#39;t exactly the most loyal to the Saudi royalty, which is one pretty big difference.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beliefs_and_ideology_of_Osama_bin_Laden">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beliefs_and_ideology_of_Osama_bin_Laden</a></p>

<p>Granted these are Wikipedia articles, but both of them are sourced appropriately. He may have been within Wahhabism early on so you are technically right in saying he was Wahhabi, but Qutbism was a larger influence in his thoughts and actions later in life, especially with al Qaeda.</p>

<p>None of these Wiki links are acceptable as valid sources for your claim, since Israel has been documented admitting it has trained large groups of Zionist nationals to post pro-Israeli political propaganda on Wikipedia.

<p>This link contradicts your initial claim, which was that OBL was a Wahhabist in his early life and later defected to Qutbism. I quote:-</p>

<p><strong>Bin Laden was not inspired by Wahhabism but by the writings of the Egyptian ideologue Sayyid Qutb</strong></p>

<p>In other words, the claim is that bin Laden at no point was inspired by Wahhabism. So pray tell why did he join the Wahhabist movement and become a Wahhabist? These two things don&#39;t appear to fit together. Here is what Hugh Fitzgerald, Vice-President of JihadWatch, has to say about Karen Armstrong&#39;s claims:-</p>

<p><strong>A scandal, consisting almost entirely of baseless assertions, incredible omissions, and complete fabrications.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wahhabism">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wahhabism</a></p>

<p>Your final link is the blog of a private writer. It could have been written by anybody and has no merit as a reliable source of information. So, now that your false claims are taken care of, again we have the &quot;world&#39;s foremost expert on OBL&quot;:-</p>

<p><strong>Professor Bruce Lawrence, head of Duke University&#39;s religious studies&#39; department and the foremost Bin Laden expert, argues that the increasingly secular language in the video and audio tapes of Osama (his earliest ones are littered with references to God and the Prophet Mohammed) are inconsistent with his strict Islamic religion, Wahhabism.</strong></p>

<p>Further support here:-</p>

<p><strong>Saudi monarchs have historically supported and promoted a form of Islamic practice – Wahhabism – considered by many as one of the most extremist strains of Sunni Islam. Despite all the surface appearances in Saudi Arabia – the skyscrapers, glitzy shopping malls, and other ostensible symbols of modernity – Wahhabis are explicitly anti-modern.</strong></p>

<p><strong>While calling for a return to the practices of the Prophet Mohammad and his early disciples, they shun anything that in their view contradicts the Prophet’s teachings. That includes gender equality, liberal dress, drinking, music, dance, and religious pluralism. Although not always politically radical, their views have been interpreted to justify violence against non-Wahhabi Muslims and non-Muslims. Their worldview has played a key role in the radicalization of men and women the world over, with a notable example being the late Osama Bin Laden. The Islamic State also owes its ideological basis to Wahhabism. It is, then, important to understand the history of Wahhabism, its role in Saudi society and politics, and the existential threat it poses to the region and the world.</strong></p>

<p><strong>In this book Natana DeLong-Bas offers an in-depth study of the written works of al-Wahhab and demonstrates how it has been distorted into the extremist ideology now propagated by Osama bin Laden and his followers.

<p><strong>Wahhabism: A deadly scripture.</strong></p>

<p><strong>But concerns are growing within Muslim circles about the increased reach of Wahhabism, Saudi&#39;s obscurantist and intolerant form of Islam in which Osama Bin Laden has his roots.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The full article also explains his differences from Wahhabi ideology.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bin Laden was a devout believer in the writings of Muhammad bin Abd-al-Wahab, the founder of Wahhabi ideology. The precise academics of it are not relevant, because he followed its practices, which include not publicly flaunting wealth and not wearing jewellery. Not until 2001, when he (purportedly) appeared on a grainy video, looking nothing like himself, did he ever wear jewellery on his fingers.</p>

<p>Your initial claim that he wore jewellery in public prior to 2001 is categorically false. </p>

<p>Support:-</p>

<p><strong>It was also pointed out that it was surprising that a man with the ability to organise the attacks on America would be naive enough to confess on tape. And some observers point out that Bin Laden appears to be wearing a ring on his right hand. In previous film of Bin Laden released by him, he has worn no jewellery apart from a watch.</strong></p>

Rebel Leader from a rich family. He could sit home and enjoy his wealth and drive a Mercedes Benz but he gave all of that up to Kill Americans (well, Kill FOR Americans first and then Kill Americans. You just can&#39;t trust these guys.) Using his vast spy network (and a few calls to his buddies at the CIA), He got wind of the War Games happening on 9/11 so he planned his operation for when the military would be unprepared. Then he would recruit 19 Saudis who just happened to get their Visa Fast Tracked even though most of them should have not been allowed to fly to the US. The 19 Saudis would train at a variety of flight schools, including US military Bases without anyone catching on. (Except for all of the FBI Agents who reported it to the superiors only to be told to mind your own business.) Then on 9/11, they successfully highjack 4 airliners without incident. They swept into the cockpit so fast. Not a single pilot squawked the highjack code. And then 3 of the planes hit their targets and the 4th wouldn&#39;t have been stopped by the military either but luckily that plane was full of Patriots who took back the plane and crashed it into a field. (Wouldn&#39;t that make a great Die Hard Movie? McClain is on a plane that gets highjacked so he kills the terrorists, takes back the plane and crashes it into the side of a mountain killing everyone. The End.). With 2 of the planes, they leveled the entire World Trade Center Complex, mostly targeting Insurance Brokers and Auditors at both the WTC and the Pentagon.  And then for over 10 years, he managed to elude the most powerful nation on the planet while sending out videos and audio messages on CNN and suffering from complete kidney failure and a variety of other serious health issues. That is until we tortured the fuck out of some Muslim who gave up Bin Laden&#39;s hideout and then it was on like Donkey Kong. Seal Team 6 swooped down from Stealth Helicopters. Bin Laden saw them coming and threw one of his shoes into the Helicopters rotors, taking out one of the Helicopters. Seal Team 6 stormed the compound, killing everyone as they leveled up to Bin Laden&#39;s Level. They busted into his room where he was jacking off one last time to his American Porn Stash. They shot him 1500 times before he could bust a bit, which is a shame because they needed a DNA sample because no one is going to believe they really killed him. They took the body and flew it out to sea where he was buried according to Islamic Tradition because we&#39;re righteous crusaders. You may be our enemy but we still respect your religious ceremonies.  What a load of Hollywood Bullshit.</p>

<p>Yes, perfectly put. The official story is so absurd that it requires Bin Laden to have had spies in America at the very highest levels of the military and/or political establishment. It is just utterly ridiculous, and an insult to the intelligence of humanity.</p>

<p>Additionally, the NIST reports all underwent lengthy public comment periods.</p>

<p>The final work, being tested and certified by so many preeminent experts and incorporating into it the feedback of others in the field in such a thorough and open way, has far surpassed the review necessary for publication in a peer reviewed journal. </p>

<p><strong>The Jerusalem Post later reported that a white van with a bomb was stopped as it approached the George Washington Bridge, but the ethnicity of the suspects was not revealed. Here&#39;s what the Jerusalem Post reported on September 12, 2001:</strong> </p>

<p><strong>American security services overnight stopped a car bomb on the George Washington Bridge. The van, packed with explosives, was stopped on an approach ramp to the bridge.

<p>I&#39;m surprise I have to explain that, in the current media environment, there is, sadly, a greater demand to be first than to be right. There were many, many other false reports on the day:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>• At 8:45 am, the Ottawa Citizen reported that a “Cessna-type” aircraft crashed into the World Trade Center (they weren’t alone.)</p>

<p>• At 9:42am, NBC’s Jim Miklaszewski told viewers that “it appears that a bomb was detonated at the [Pentagon] heliport.” Six minutes later, Tom Brokaw said there was a report on Dubai television that Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine had claimed responsibility. </p>

<p>• 10:12am — CNN reported, “There’s a report of an explosion on Capitol Hill.” Five minutes later, a congressional correspondent said there was no explosion, but that “the Speaker and other leaders have been evacuated to a secure location.”</p>

<p>• Three times, according to Fairness &amp; Accuracy in Reporting, CBS’ Dan Rather told viewers of a car bomb at the State Department.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>NONE OF THIS HAPPENED. Nor was there any &quot;van full of explosives.&quot; Those who cling to this, despite the lack of actual evidence for it, say rather more about their own agenda than the events of the day. But your agenda is already extremely clear. </p>

<p>Lmfao. Yeah, real credible witness there, bud.</p>

<p><strong>From top cop to ex-con, Kerik slams U.S. prison system.</strong></p>

<p><strong>His mother was an alcoholic prostitute murdered by her pimp. Kerik was a high school dropout, who later went back to get his GED.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Almost as quickly as he was anointed, Kerik was nailed on allegations that he had hired a nanny who carried phony documents and was tarred with whispered allegations of ties to shady contractors, even organized crime. He was forced to withdraw his nomination.</strong></p>

<p><strong>In 2009, the former top cop copped pleas to eight felony tax and false-statement charges, including lying to the White House. He was sent to a federal minimum-security prison in Cumberland, Md.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>A liquid eutectic mixture containing primarily iron, oxygen, and sulfur formed during this hot corrosion attack on the steel. This sulfur-rich liquid penetrated preferentially down grain boundaries of the steel, severely weakening the beam and making it susceptible to erosion. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s the explanation. The only actual question is where the sulfur came from, which I addressed. Well, that and the question of whether the erosion took place before or after the collapse; the latter would obviously completely negate the munitions theory. </p>

<p>Just a tip: If you expect to be taken seriously you should change your attitude. I read through the whole thread and the way you react to people who criticize you is laughable. If you want to convince people of your theories it takes more than &quot;For God&#39;s sake what kind of drugs are you on, man?&quot;. If you know so much about 9/11 it should be easy to you to disprove any of <a href="/u/SkeptiConspiracist1">/u/SkeptiConspiracist1</a> points with a few sentences. But instead of doing this you behave like a child.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know anything about 9/11 but just based on the stuff other people wrote here in the thread I tend to believe them. Half the arguments that you listed are just not convincing to me. Especially the rings of OBL. Really? Some rings? Come on, you can do better than this. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>This is an important question, and I believe the answer depends on where the fire is. Remember that heat rises, so the closer the fire is to the top of the building, the less likely it is to cause a total collapse. If you consider the north tower, for example, it was 110 floors high, and was impacted between floors 93 and 99, way above its centre of gravity. Hence, without explosives, you&#39;re left with the argument that those 17 floors suddenly and somehow gained enough weight to crush the undamaged 93 floor section beneath themselves.</p>

<p>In other words, you&#39;re left with a physically impossible argument. And this is why 9/11 has f!cked me up so much. It&#39;s made me understand that truth is completely unimportant to the world we live in. We are governed by politics, and politics has effectively become the art of lying.</p>

<p>It&#39;s difficult for me to explain myself without you having my experience of debating about 9/11. After doing it enough, you recognise the people who are not genuine. Most people on the internet can and do lie about who they are and what they do. They do it because they want you to be persuaded by the bullshit they write, not on its merit, but on the false appeal to authority they make beforehand. </p>

<p>That person is categorically not a structural engineer. Structural engineers must by definition be fully aware of the laws of classical mechanics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem here is that this isn&#39;t a basic mechanical issue. There&#39;s a lot going on. But to explain why they fell mostly downwards, think of it as a domino effect. Near the impact, we&#39;ve already lost tons of support beams, etc etc. However, the weight that the remaining beams needs to support remains, and thus, is redistributed among these remaining beams, adding to their stress. Overloaded, they begin to fail, and would pretty much fail simultaneously--a chain reaction. Thus, suddenly a tremendous weight collapses all at once, and the floors beneath pancake downwards. </p>

<p>Right. Thanks bro. I was really wondering how the top 17 floors of a building broke the law of equilibrium, failed to fall to the path of least resistance, and crushed the 93 floors which they had been resting on for 40 years to the ground. I was particularly confused about why these top 17 floors didn&#39;t slow down when they met the massive resistance of five sixths of a skyscraper, but your referral to the &quot;domino effect&quot; really makes it clear for me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Overloaded, they begin to fail</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And fall straight through the path of greatest resistance? Tell me, does this happen with all kinds of objects, or just with buildings? For example if I were to rest a tennis ball on top of a chair and then if the tennis ball &quot;failed&quot;, would it then crush the chair to the ground?</p>

<p>You see, I&#39;m still a little bit confused I think, because I didn&#39;t know much lighter objects could crush much heavier objects to the ground spontaneously, at free fall speed, while blasting out all the windows. </p>

<p>Oh no hang on. Sorry bro, but they&#39;re telling me on the Batphone that you&#39;re a total, table-chewing idiot who doesn&#39;t understand the way the basic laws of physics work. Heavy objects sometimes crush lighter objects they are at rest upon, but I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve ever seen any case anywhere in the world outside 9/11 where someone has tried to convince me that lighter objects crush heavier ones.</p>

<p>You know why?</p>

<p>Because it doesn&#39;t happen. Try it and see. Rest a ball on your idiot head. Does it crush you to the ground?</p>

<p>Well then.</p>

<p>First, I&#39;m trying to have a calm discussion, and you come off cursing and attacking me. What does that accomplish, exactly? Being a skeptic doesn&#39;t mean you find a group of people who share your beliefs and circle jerk.</p>

<p>Secondly, how else would you expect the building to fall? What other force is acting on it that would pull it sideways? Gravity pulls towards the earth (see:  downwards), and any torque on the building is negligible at that scale and is heavily out weighed by the force of gravity pulling the building down. </p>

<p>Thirdly,  the bottom floors of the building aren&#39;t designed to take the full weight of the,  what,  17 floors above it, all falling a story downwards at once? Not even in the best of conditions would the building survive. That&#39;s a huge <em>downwards</em> force. And so begins the domino effect. </p>

<p>Lastly, it didn&#39;t collapse at free fall speed. Time it. </p>

<p>Again, I&#39;m only saying that for all the reasons to be skeptical, the way the building fell, to me,  and most other engineering professionals I&#39;ve spoken with,  makes sense. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Well, firstly, when things <em>&quot;fall&quot;</em> as you put it, they move through the air rather than through half a million tons of concrete and steel. That process is called <em>crushing</em>, not falling. Hence, you are abusing language and trying to use that abuse to work around the laws of physics. </p>

<p>Secondly, the damaged top section of the north building, which was only a maximum of 17 floors, would have simply toppled off the side. That is, it would have fallen to the path of least resistance, as opposed to your ludicrous version of reality, where it &quot;fell&quot; straight through half a million tons of concrete and steel with no help from explosives to cut the resistance in the bottom of the building.</p>

<p>You are quite literally breaking the laws of physics with aberrations of language. If I seem cross with you, it&#39;s because I find that kind of thing offensive and stupid, as I also find your claims that we should believe you because you can make up stories on the internet. I can do that too, see. I went to Harvard and I have a quantum computer in my toe.</p>

<p>Do me a favour and jog on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I said, you&#39;re not required to believe me. I&#39;m still not a specialist in building design,  rather,  astrophysics. However, I can lend my knowledge of general physics to the subject. </p>

<p>You still haven&#39;t substantiated your claim that it should fall off to the side. What&#39;s pushing it to the side? There&#39;s no applied force strong enough to do so. Wind wouldn&#39;t blow over the top of a building. So, since you haven&#39;t offered an explanation, allow me to do so with a little more depth.</p>

<p>The plane struck the building, immediately destroying/weakening several load bearing beams. Now,  the load is redistributed to the remaining beams, and for awhile, they do the job, though they are now operating above capacity, and the continual application of heat is reducing the aforementioned maximum load capacity. </p>

<p>Eventually the stress becomes too much for one of the beams, and it snaps. This causes a chain reaction of sorts. The weight of the floors--exactly as it happened when the plane first struck the building--is immediately redistributed to the remaining beams. Already over capacity, these beams would fail almost simultaneously. Now, we have the entire upper 17 floors falling approximately one story down onto the rest of the tower. </p>

<p>Now, let&#39;s do some extremely simplified math to get an idea of the force these 17 floors are coming down with. I&#39;m not going to bother working out stress tensors or any nonsense like that because one, it&#39;s an Internet discussion,  and two, I don&#39;t have all of the necessary information available to me to do so and I&#39;m not about to simulate the madness of 9/11 on one of my work desktops. </p>

<p>I&#39;m going to make a few assumptions to make the math easier. Let&#39;s assume a uniform distribution of mass. A little research tells me that the buildings weigh 1.5 million tons. So,  the top 17 floors we&#39;ll estimate to weigh ~232,000 tons, or about ~464 million pounds, or about ~210 million kg.</p>

<p>Now, let&#39;s assume that these 17 floors accelerated at some fraction of the acceleration of gravity. There will be some resistance here, so rather than 9.8, let&#39;s cut that down by a quarter and go ~7.5. It may be less,  may be more, this is all just an exercise. So, a very simple,  NEWTONIAN formula, since you&#39;re fond of such simple physical quantities, is F = ma. We have our approximate mass, and we&#39;ve estimated an acceleration. The force coming down is approximately F = 210,000,000x7.5 = ~1.58 billion (kgm/s<sup>2</sup> ) newtons (1.58 giganewtons, gN) of force coming down on the remaining sections of the building. </p>

<p>I realize newtons is a bit of an archaic unit of measurement. To draw a comparison, the force in newtons to propel the Saturn 5 rocket at liftoff was about 35 meganewtons, or 35 million newtons, or about 2% the force the top 17 floors of the building may have fallen with, simply because of the sheer mass of the object. The structural support on the floor this weight fell upon hadn&#39;t a chance at surviving the force of that impact. Those beams fail, and now it&#39;s 18 floors coming down, then 19, then 20, and our domino effect begins.</p>

<p>Again, this is a rough estimate and a basic mathematical model to express the force coming down onto the rest of the building, but it serves the purpose of quantifying the event.</p>

<p>Now, quell your hostility in your next rebuttal, please. I&#39;m trying to have a civil discussion with you. You&#39;re only perpetuating the stereotype most, uh, &quot;sheeple&quot; have of conspiracy theorists. </p>

<p>It isn&#39;t a case of not believing you. As I have patiently explained twice already, you are deliberately abusing language in order to circumvent the most basic laws of physics. </p>

<p>I really have no interest in reading through pages of your insane rubbish. It is just pure, unadulterated rubbish.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Those 17 floors are forbidden from moving downwards by Newton&#39;s law of mechanical equilibrium you intellectually redundant bozo. The sum of forces acting upon the building was equal to zero, and hence you are trying to begin your fantasy explanation in the middle of an equation. </p>

<p>You need to begin by explaining where the extra downward force came from which pushed the top 17 floors through the bottom 93 floors (which contained the accumulative resistance of half a million tons of concrete and steel). It can&#39;t come from gravity, because the effect of gravity is constant and yet the buildings were in a state of mechanical equilibrium. Hence, there was as much resistance pushing back up as there was pushing downwards.</p>

<p>And therefore, what your 2,000 words of rubbish says in plain English is that the acceleration of gravity increased. </p>

<p>Since those of us who are not liars or idiots know this did not happen, therefore something destroyed the resistance in the bottom 93 floors of building, and thus gravity brought the damaged section straight down to the ground.</p>

<p>Now, you can write me ten thousand more words of number-based nonsense if you like, but of those two explanations, only one is physically possible.</p>

<blockquote>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right. The buildings were in equilibrium. Then some planes flew into them.</p>

<p>As soon as the plane severed key structural support beams the load of the top floors HAD to be redistributed to the remaining, surrounding beams. You see, that&#39;s why buildings have a skeleton throughout the structure and not just at the bottom. The weight of the building is supported by beams throughout. When key beams are severed, the weight doesn&#39;t redistribute to ALL the other bones in the building uniformly. Think of it this way: stack some blocks and make a tall, table-shaped platform. Now, place a bunch of heavy objects on only one side of the structure. That will be the side to give way, because it&#39;s bearing most of the weight. If you try to lift one side of the table, then the other, one side will be heavier than the other because gravity is pulling down, not diagonally, not sideways, towards a common center (Earth).</p>

<p>Luckily, skyscrapers aren&#39;t built with the same simplicity. But the physics remains the same. </p>

<p>So,  while the acceleration of gravity didn&#39;t change (much,  technically... never mind), and the total weight of the building also hasn&#39;t changed, the support within the building has. It&#39;s lessened. The same weight is coming down onto less support. That&#39;s like you suddenly losing 20% muscle mass in your legs, and constantly ebbing more away (fire).  Fire doesn&#39;t help. The load capacity decreases at high heat.  Beams begin to bow, reach their breaking point, and snap, and it would only take one, because as soon as that one snaps, the remaining weight is,  again,  redistributed, then another snaps, then another, rapidly.  Then, these top 17 floors FALL onto the remaining floors beneath them because gravity is still pulling them towards the earth.  There&#39;s some resistance as the remaining beams give way, but the result is the same. See previous comment for a refresher of the rest.</p>

<p>You still haven&#39;t told me what force should push it sideways. Your insults detracting from the actual argument are all you have. You&#39;re leaving out key points and failing to comment on ones you&#39;d rather ignore (the whole plane crashing into the building thing, for instance). Seriously, if you decide to reply again, there&#39;s no need for insults. It only weakens your argument. I&#39;ve been civil. And you&#39;re attacking me with a similar blind zeal as an ISIS soldier might for Islam. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to turn you into a government-loving,  unquestioning jerk-off. I&#39;m trying to explain to you, as someone who studied physics and works as an engineer with other engineers, what most of us believe given our knowledge base. I don&#39;t claim to have supreme authority over the subject. But I certainly consider my opinion on the events weightier than someone untrained in the subject in physics. Just the same way as I wouldn&#39;t be trusted in a pharmaceutical laboratory over, say, a biochemist.</p>

<p>You were correct on the weight, however. Though a <em>rough</em> exercise, I thought my number seemed high.  The New York state museum had listed 1.5 million tons as their total weight and I glossed over this in my haste.  So we half our original weight instead. Since our equation is only multiplicative, it halves our force value. It&#39;s only 25 Saturn V rockets launching off the top of the skyscraper. Even if we use your weight instead, we&#39;re still launching ~17 rockets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sick of seeing your giant walls of text. You are a determined liar without the faintest idea what you are talking about.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;re right. The buildings were in equilibrium. Then some planes flew into them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. Just no. When a building or any other object leaves static equilibrium, then it collapses instantly, because the force of gravity is then stronger than the force resisting gravity. The very instant you leave equilibrium you are directed towards the path of the strongest force acting upon you, and you will continue upon that same path until affected by another force. A building which is no longer in equilibrium cannot continue to stand because the very definition of equilibrium is what enables things to stand in the first place. If you are not in equilibrium and you are at rest, then you are on the floor, because gravity constantly pulls everything down. It doesn&#39;t wait an hour and a half before it pulls you down. It does it immediately. </p>

<p>As you have just been told, as per the north tower, the plane flew into the 93rd floor and exploded. The building did not fall down, which means that it was still in equilibrium. The reason it did not fall down is because the bottom 93 floors were still providing adequate structural resistance against the damaged section, which was comprised of less than the top 1/6th of the building. Hence, unless the acceleration of gravity increased then there was no way for that top 17 floor section which was damaged to get through the vastly superior section which resisted it. Not unless someone blew out the resistance in the bottom 93 floors with explosives first.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to ignore you now, because you are either a deliberate liar, or you are mentally ill. My guess is you are a typical Hasbara troll and you are deliberately being ruthlessly deceitful. Either way, you have no understanding of physics, which is only accentuated by your long walls of text and grandiose claims about being an astronaut. </p>

<p>In sum, I just think you are a total moron. Sorry.</p>

<p>17 floors of building are not exactly weightless. If they suddenly start dropping due to some structural damage and fall down a few feet that is quite a lot of kinetic energy. I don&#39;t think the rest of the building was prepared to take this sudden and massive increase in load.</p>

<p>Solid point, brother. Even once they get past explaining who picked up the top section and dropped it, they then have to begin explaining why, when it encountered the opposing resistance of 93 floors of concrete and steel, instead of slowing down, it fucking well accelerated.</p>

<p>If the resistance encountered during the fall is less then the kinetic energy (simply spoken) it still accelerates. That is also a fact of classical mechanics. Just imaging a skydiver falling through boards of styrofoam and a skydiver falling through slabs of concrete. In the first case you can be 100% sure that he still accelerates. That&#39;s what gravity is usually doing to stuff that falls.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t seem to realize just how much energy 17 floors of concrete and steel have once they start moving.</p>

<p>It seems like a single tower weighs about 600000 tons. Assuming even distribution of weight the upper 17 floors weigh close to 80000-100000 tons. Do you really thing that anything can stop them as soon as they start moving?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right that the floors were designed with a safety factor of 3-5 (this is actually quite high, I&#39;m in aerospace engineering and we usually use 2). However you need to understand that buildings are designed for static loads, meaning that it can hold that much more weight if it is not moving at all. Once that first floor collapsed you now have a dynamic load. Dynamic loads are much harder to support as you not only have to work against the force of gravity, but also to counteract the incredibly amount of momentum that it gains during the fall before too much deformation happens. In the right conditions, no floor will be able to withstand the falling load on top of it. If the plane had hit the top floors of the building, it probably wouldn&#39;t have fallen completely as there just wasn&#39;t enough mass up there. But the portion above the impact site was massive enough that nothing could stop it once it started moving. </p>

<p>And I&#39;m not sure about your exploding outwards claim. From all the videos I&#39;ve seen it seems to fall pretty much straight down, with rubble going out at the bottom which is to be expected from every collapse. </p>

<p>The failure of the floor systems if I&#39;m not misunderstanding you does explain the collapse. From the sources I&#39;ve seen about the layout of the building, there is a central core which held most of the weight. The floors were all anchored to this core and the outer shell was then attached to the floors with some support of their own coming from below.</p>

<p>I do not claim to know how much this central core was damaged and how it broke, but once the thing started to fall the floors would bend in the middle due to the upward loads at the center and perimeter and the downward load (from the falling mass) at mid-span. Due to steel being very resistant to elongation, this would then pull the outer walls that were attached to the floors inwards. This would compress the falling mass into the center allowing for more of this mid-span loading to take place and allowing the building to fall straight down. This is what the videos show to me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The floors were also connected to the inner core. They would have helped to pull it down too as well as pulling it outwards which would lower its structural integrity greatly as concrete shatters with very small amounts of tension. Also the inner core of the above floors would also be falling on top of what core remained which would also have structural damage due to the floors buckling. I&#39;m not saying that this is exactly what happened as I was not the one doing the investigation. I&#39;m simply pointing out that there are ways that the buildings could have collapsed without needing explosives like you all suggest is the only way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This isn&#39;t about pancaking floors. Pancaking concrete floors are a red herring. They were attached to steel columns.  Just because concrete starts falling through the floor doesn&#39;t mean you get steel column collapse. Pancaking floors can only occur as a result of symmetrical  collapse of the steel column supports. The pancaking floor can only occur after total collapse. Otherwise, we would find a dangling empty metal frame a thousand feet high.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t quite know what you mean by pancaking, but I don&#39;t see how floor dynamics can be considered a red herring. When the floors bend (and it&#39;s really easy to bend a material) they would have pulled in the sides and every other column would have been pulled in some way. These columns would have bent, even just slightly by this proceeding. Once a column begins to bend any vertical load will cause it to buckle immediately (technically it&#39;s not called buckling but it amounts to the same thing), especially when this load is dozens of stories of building falling at speed. In my scenario (which isn&#39;t perfect) the columns would have all been compromised and failed because of the floors. How is that a red herring?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The columns penetrate multiple floors. These columns aren&#39;t stacked on each other one floor at a time. One column could go through a hundred floors. Some types of columns collapsing doesn&#39;t mean all columns would collapse. What amount of force does it take to bend a hundred foot column vs a thirty foot column? This video shows all columns coming down, but some columns should have been sheered away and remained standing. Columns on the middle,  left, right, forward, back. Support columns of concrete, support columns of steel...Columns that support ten floors, columns that support fifty. The columns were blown from the inside for special effect to create the ejecting debris. Your theory relies on symmetrical column collapse for a non symmetrical building with elevator support columns and the core columns were not all th same length or extending to the top floors. Central core column density varies as you go up the building.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not really sure why having columns span multiple floors would matter. It&#39;s actually easier to bend longer columns than it is short ones, especially if the floors acting as separators between them were compromised. </p>

<p>You do have to realize that this was just a theory I made off the top of my head to try to explain how floors losing their integrity could help cause the collapse to continue. Even the building layout I described wasn&#39;t exactly accurate, I was just going off of what some people were claiming in their demolition theories. Many posters were saying that the central core of this building would have stopped the floors collapsing, no it wouldn&#39;t have. </p>

<p>This all started when someone said it should have slowed down when it actually sped up, an argument which I attempted to dissolve as it&#39;s not how momentum works. </p>

<p>Either way. I&#39;m choosing to drop this argument, and don&#39;t deny that this is any more than that at this point. I haven&#39;t seen any conclusive evidence which allows me morally to accuse a potentially innocent person of terrorism, especially when it caused the death of so many people. When I say conclusive I mean evidence that CANNOT be explained by more rational physical explanations. Innocent until PROVEN guilty, beyond all reasonable doubt. This has not happened even in the slightest. </p>

<p>This is just an argument now because in your post you evidently state that you are absolutely convinced that it was a controlled demolition and will not change your stance on that no matter what. I am in the opposite field and we will never get to common ground. So let&#39;s drop this. </p>

<p>Each floor of the WTC towers were designed with a redundancy factor of 3-5 times, to hold <strong>ALL</strong> the floors above it, per floor, example, 3-5 times redundancy floor one vs floor two, 6-10 times redundancy floor one vs floor three, 9-15 times redundancy floor one vs floor three etc This is why skyscrapers get lighter as they get taller, the WTC 1&amp;2 blueprints clearly show this</p>

<p>You can not and will not make any mathematical sense from the NIST report that you are defending</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And I&#39;m not sure about your exploding outwards claim. From all the videos I&#39;ve seen it seems to fall pretty much straight down, with rubble going out at the bottom which is to be expected from every collapse.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>WTC1&amp;2 were explosively demolished from top to bottom, WTC7 was demolished from the bottom, working up, have you mixed up what structures we are talking about?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From the sources I&#39;ve seen about the layout of the building, there is a central core which held most of the weight</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Source this massive claim then, i have the blue prints of the building in front of me btw</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I do not claim to know how much this central core was damaged</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know, controlled demolition.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but once the thing started to fall the floors would bend in the middle due to the upward loads at the center and perimeter and the downward load (from the falling mass) at mid-span</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Source, do not waste you time looking to NIST or ANY other official source, they do not know, YOU HAVE MADE UP YOUR OWN PERSONAL CONSPIRACY THEORY</p>

<p>You mad tin foil hat wearer hahhahaha</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Due to steel being very resistant to elongation, this would then pull the outer walls that were attached to the floors inwards</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More CONSPIRACY!!!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This would compress the falling mass into the center allowing for more of this mid-span loading to take place and allowing the building to fall straight down</p>
</blockquote>

<p>EVEN MOAR Conspiracy!!!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is what the videos show to me.</p>

<p>K, i do not agree with your personal conspiracy theory, i do like the fact you disagree with the US government &quot;official &quot; conspiracy theory though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay I&#39;ll explain what I did with my theory. I took arguments of people claiming it was controlled. People kept saying in this and many other threads that &quot;there was this incredible inner core which could not have been destroyed and the floors were attached to that&quot; (paraphrased). I took this and ran with it to show that their explanation using their claimed building layout was not the only plausible option. </p>

<p>For the dynamic loads, that just how momentum works. In the case of part of a building falling, you have to apply a large amount of upwards force to decelerate it for it to stop. When everything is stationary then all you need to do is to counteract the forces of gravity. When slowing down a dynamic load you have to exert a greater force for this deceleration, and this has to happen before the structure has deformed enough for it to be compromised. This building was falling at quite a speed. Due to the relation of impulse and momentum, in order for the fall to stop in an incredibly short time span (before things buckle and break) the force applied would have to be massive. I&#39;m also not claiming about how the fall could have started. This discussion began when someone said that it should not have accelerated downwards.</p>

<p>For your curiosity about the aerospace factors of safety, it&#39;s mostly a standard. However I was able to find FAA safety recommendations for astronautical vehicles. Not aviation, but its the same industry anyway. For most components, the recommended values are between 1 and 2. Occasionally there&#39;s one at 4 but these are for small components. In aerospace, mass is king. You lower it as much as you can while still having an aura of safety. <a href="https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ast/licenses_permits/media/RLV_Safety_Critical_Structures_Guide_v2.3_112205.pdf">Here&#39;s</a> the link if you were wondering.</p>

<p>I also don&#39;t quite get what you&#39;re getting on about. Dynamic loads are harder to support than static loads as you need to decelerate something which requires extra force. That&#39;s a fact of classical physics. </p>

<p>When I say counteract forces of gravity, that is the loading. The loading due to gravity of all the weight it needs to support, for which it was designed on a static basis. The only other loading is from wind forces.</p>

<p>This is like carrying a bowling ball in your hand (static problem, quite easy to do), versus stopping the ball after it has dropped ten feet. Oh and if your hand moved down by more an inch or two, the support (your hand) breaks and it keeps falling.</p>

<p>If the point of the airplane impact did buckle dropping the 20 something, or whatever, top stories onto the rest; how did the top part not encounter at least enough resistance to slow down a bit more and possibly topple over sideways?</p>

<p>Either the bottoms of those skyscrapers were made of balsa wood, or something&#39;s fucky...</p>

<p>Not to mention building 7 which completely lacked a &quot;billiard ball&quot;. </p>

<p>That fire must have weakened all the supports perfectly even throughout the entire building, because in no way would fire most likely burn unevenly causing an asymmetric collapse /S.</p>

<p>Sure it&#39;s possible, just not very probable; especially happening in the same style 3 times in a row.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A resting ball puts a certain amount of pressure to a surface. If the same ball <em>falls</em> onto the same surface there is most certainly <em>more</em> pressure on the surface. Or do you want to say that this very simple fact of classical physics is not true?</p>

<p>The same for a building. The upper 17 floors put some amount of pressure onto the levels below. If you know remove the inner walls (by explosion, by structural failure, by whatever...) so that the upper 17 floors starts moving downwards there <em>is</em> an increase of pressure on the lower floor.</p>

<p>Please tell me exactly where I am wrong in this very simple example.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But in order for it to fall down upon itself, the supports need to be removed simultaneously, or it topples over the edge if anything. In my opinion, where you are wrong in this example is the walls are not the support. A crapload of thick metal bars are and a plane is not going to take them all out simultaneously, nor is a fire. </p>

<p>To the previous example, of a pool ball over a head. This is not the best analogy because every single column was not wiped out at once. If the floors hit just disappeared like the girl in Bewitched, perhaps. A better test would be a pool ball above the head, held up by a crapload of sticks. You remove some of those sticks and either the ball does nothing or it topples over the edge. It doesn&#39;t continue trying to go straight down when there&#39;s a lot less resistance just over the edge. In all likelihood it does nothing when those sticks are steel and bent or knicked rather than removed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Israeli newspaper Ma&#39;ariv on Wednesday reported that Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu told an audience at Bar Ilan university that the September 11, 2001 terror attacks had been beneficial for Israel.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;We are benefiting from one thing, and that is the attack on the Twin Towers and Pentagon, and the American struggle in Iraq,&quot;</strong> Ma&#39;ariv quoted the former prime minister as saying. He reportedly added that these events &quot;<strong>swung American public opinion in our favor</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>Netanyahu reportedly made the comments during a conference at Bar-Ilan University on the division of Jerusalem as part of a peace deal with the Palestinians. </p>

<p><strong>The Lavon Affair refers to a failed Israeli covert operation, code named Operation Susannah, conducted in Egypt in the Summer of 1954. As part of the false flag operation, a group of Egyptian Jews were recruited by Israeli military intelligence to plant bombs inside Egyptian, American and British-owned civilian targets, cinemas, libraries and American educational centers.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The attacks were to be blamed on the Muslim Brotherhood, Egyptian Communists, &quot;unspecified malcontents&quot; or &quot;local nationalists&quot; with the aim of creating a climate of sufficient violence and instability to induce the British government to retain its occupying troops in Egypt&#39;s Suez Canal zone.</strong></p>

<p>Operation Susannah and the Lavon Affair turned out to be disastrous for Israel in several ways:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Israel lost significant standing and credibility in its relations with the United Kingdom and the United States that took years to repair.[11]</p></li>
<li><p>The political aftermath caused considerable political turmoil in Israel that affected the influence of its government.[12]</p></li>
</ul>

<p>On March 30, 2005 <strong>Israel publicly honored the surviving operatives</strong>, and President Moshe Katsav presented each with a certificate of appreciation for their efforts on behalf of the state, <strong>ending decades of official denial by Israel</strong>.</p>

<p>The leaders of Haganah opposed the idea initially.[12] On July 1, 1946, Moshe Sneh, chief of the Haganah General Headquarters, sent a letter to the then leader of the Irgun, <strong>Menachem Begin</strong>, which instructed him to &quot;carry out the operation at the &#39;chick&#39;&quot;, code for the King David Hotel**</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know whether that is true, but if it is, he has plenty of company.</p>

<p>According to the Jewish Anti Defamation League, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/8UmQYxr.png">1.09 Billion people on planet Earth &quot;harbor anti-Semitic attitudes&quot;.</a> - and that according to their own survey of 100 countries.</p>

<p>There are only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_population_by_country">14 million Jews in the whole world</a>, and (if the ADL is to be believed) 1.09 <strong>billion</strong> people who supposedly &quot;hate&quot; them. So, for every Jewish man, woman or child, there are 77 &quot;haters&quot;.</p>

<p>WTF is  up wit that?</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://global100.adl.org/">The ADL Global 100 Survey</a></strong> is full of clickable maps and interesting information that breaks things down by age, race, sex, geographic locations of the &quot;haters&quot;, etc... but one thing they don&#39;t address is <strong>why</strong>. Why do so many people supposedly &quot;hate&quot; Jews?</p>

<p>If you were Jewish, wouldn&#39;t that be the first question you&#39;d be asking?</p>

<p>I have asked folks that question several times, and I bever get a straight, plausible answer - it&#39;s always an angry, indignant response such as <strong>BECAUSE OF PEOPLE LIKE YOU</strong>, or <strong>ANTI-SEMITES CAUSE ANTI-SEMITISM, YOU ANTI-SEMITE!!!</strong>, which really isn&#39;t a very constructive answer, especially if this is a problem that they are genuinely interested in resolving.</p>

<p>Any thoughts?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> That should be Seventy-Seven &quot;haters&quot; for every Jewish person - not 7.7.</p>

<p>Wow, talk about being the &quot;<em>unpopular kid in class</em>&quot;. Either the ADL is full of shit, or... what could it be?</p>

<p>As far as I&#39;m concerned (and as far as the laws of physics are concerned), the total symmetrical collapse of any of the buildings proves controlled demolition, but you&#39;re right that building 7 is particularly suspicious, since it wasn&#39;t hit by a plane and so it&#39;s harder to find a red herring to pin the collapse on. It hasn&#39;t stopped the corrupt lying pricks from trying though.</p>

<p>If you are trying to say that the WTC collapses were silent, then somebody needs to laugh in your face.</p>

<p><strong>Somewhere around the middle of the World Trade Center, there was this orange and red flash coming out. Initially it was just one flash. Then this flash just kept popping all the way around the building and that building had started to explode</strong></p>

<p>Karin Deshore, Captain (E.M.S.)</p>

<p><strong>And then I just remember there was just an explosion. It seemed like on television they blow up these buildings. It seemed like it was going all the way around like a belt, all these explosions.</strong></p>

<p>Rich Banaciski, Firefighter (F.D.N.Y.) [Ladder 22]</p>

<p><strong>The lowest floor of fire in the south tower actually looked like someone had planted explosives around it because the whole bottom I could see -- I could see two sides of it and the other side -- it just looked like that floor blew out. I looked up and you could actually see everything blew out on the one floor. I thought, geez, this looks like an explosion up there, it blew out.</strong></p>

<p>Brian Dixon, Battalion Chief (F.D.N.Y.)</p>

<p>In fact, let&#39;s be really honest and address the sheer stupidity in your sarcasm. Let&#39;s assume the buildings collapsed because of pancakes instead of bombs. Would that happen silently?</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t really make much sense that you would mean that, but I suppose I will take your word for it, based on the content of your other posts. This one was the curve ball.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Well now that clearly isn&#39;t true, is it? I didn&#39;t call you stupid. I said what you wrote was stupid. In the context I had taken it in, it was stupid. I have seen many trolls argue that there were no explosive sounds in the WTC. It is one of their favourite lies. In light of that, it is a remarkable coincidence that you did not mean it in this way, wouldn&#39;t you agree? Remarkable that in fact you have watched multiple videos of the WTC collapses and none of them have ever had sound.</p>

<p>I agree. It&#39;s also physically impossible for it to have collapsed like it did because of office fires.

<p>That is where the physicists are who support the 9/11 Truth movement, the thousands and thousands of physicists, with more graduating every year, the ones not backing Chandler, Gage, Szamboti, Ross, Ryan, Szuladzinski, Jones, Griscom, and two dozens of hundreds of other experts and all the laypeople with enough knowledge of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIxvQMhttq4">scientific method</a> to know the difference between &quot;inevitable&quot; [sic!

    <div class="md"><p>Engineer here. I&#39;m also quite convinced myself about the 9/11 being an inside thing, and maybe even the start of the collapse was done using explosives/thermite/etc, but those 2 points that you linked are quite wrong imho.</p>

<p><strong>The physics part</strong></p>

<p>There is one thing in physics called <em>pressure</em>. It&#39;s by definition force by unit of surface (more force and less surface make a lot of pressure). Now, keep in mind that most, if not all, the explosions you see are in the lower parts of the tower, just below the falling part. And that makes a lot of sense:</p>

<p>The building falling weights <strong>a lot</strong> (a lot of force), and is pressing the lower part making each floor collapse (very small surface in comparison with the force). Everything inside that floor (air, walls, furniture, people, and even debris) just gained a lot of pressure there and the most fragile part of the floor are the lateral walls (they are not designed to hold almost any force at all, while the floor and the ceiling are really a lot stronger). That means that all that pressure can only go to the sides exploding like a can with too much pressure inside.</p>

<p>Also, as other experts say you have the &quot;spring effect&quot; that pushes stuff to the sides. That&#39;s quite normal, specially in a building made of steel. Nothing falls straight down if there is other stuff below, it just collapses floor by floor, and each floor is different, the forces are different and not all the floor collapses at the exactly same time making that some debris goes to one direction and other goes to other direction.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that this horizontal forces never break any physics rule at all. And remember that a building collapsing is not a solid rigid (something that all those equations you study in physics assume).</p>

<p>Also, a building is not a free falling object so you can&#39;t compare the timing with a ball falling from a building. It&#39;s not a rigid body, and it&#39;s not &quot;falling&quot;, it&#39;s <em>collapsing</em>, an extremely different term and very difficult to study and predict because there are lot&#39;s of different variables unknown in play.</p>

<p>Is it normal for big building parts to fall far to the sides? Yes. Obviously. Just play jenga and you&#39;ll see if part&#39;s can fall to the sides even if the only apparent force is gravity.
It&#39;s an effect of something called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_%28physics%29">moment</a>. Things tend to turn if they are not stable, and that can make something fall to the sides, and if that collapses with something lower it can send it to the side even further.</p>

<p><strong>Jet-fuel can&#39;t melt steel</strong></p>

<p>And neither needs to. Steel loses lot&#39;s of it&#39;s load capacity with high temperature and time (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creep_%28deformation%29">creep</a>, physical deformations, changes in the weights supported). Also the buildings were quite old and lot has changed in the fire regulations since. I&#39;m not sure about it but afaik the building used only steel beams as support, and steel behavior is really bad with high temperatures (doesn&#39;t need to be even near the melting point) in comparison with other elements such as reinforced concrete. Do you know what a forge is? Do they melt the steel? No right? It&#39;s not even near melting point in fact, and just a man with a hammer can bend the steel.</p>

<p>Now imagine an extremely big building with some structural damage (did some beams got cut because of the plane crashing? If they did the force that those beams were doing to support the building is now in the beams that are still intact). Add that extra weight that the beams have to support to the much higher temperatures and give it some time... boom they loose most of it&#39;s strength and just bend. One bends, the building doesn&#39;t fall but the tension the other beams has to support increases, boom, another beam less... and suddenly all the floor collapses.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying it might be not a thermite ignition at first, but once one of the floors collapsed, the building was already condemned. Floors are not designed to support half building falling on top of them (percussion).</p>

<p>I feel I&#39;m going to get downvoted to hell, but this is what I can tell you from what I have studied in these last 7 years at college. Some parts might be wrong but I&#39;m sure that what you linked doesn&#39;t prove anything at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are some points said in this thread that I do believe are true and some that I don&#39;t. Those two I pointed for example seem to me something that someone that hasn&#39;t studied structural analysis would say.</p>

<p>Why do I think it&#39;s an inside job? First I have to warn you that I&#39;m not from the USA, and I really don&#39;t like at all their government so my view could be quite biased.</p>

<p><strong>First point</strong>: It&#39;s not the first time that the USA attacks himself to start a war because of interests. Here the war with Spain comes to my mind, remember? The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Maine_%28ACR-1%29">USS Maine</a>: <a href="http://www.falseflag.info/uss-maine/">http://www.falseflag.info/uss-maine/</a></p>

<p>There are also other similar cases: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Northwoods">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Northwoods</a> This one didn&#39;t happen in the end but was planned. Who know what they have done before and after for their interests?</p>

<p><strong>Second point</strong>: It&#39;s usually said &quot;look for the first beneficiary and you&#39;ll have your first suspect&quot;. As most have pointed out, the USA government, specially Bush and his friends, big corporations (weapons-making, war mercenaries, oil multinationals, ...), and Israel, big friend of the USA, had a lot of interest in that war as pointed out in this thread.</p>

<p><strong>Third point</strong>: The buildings collapse almost vertically. If a plane hits a side I expect the beams in that side to suffer more than the ones on the other side. And that means that the buildings should have bent to the side the plane crashed before falling to the ground. To me it seems that at least the first (and maybe the rest) of the floors were detonated to avoid destroying half of the city. Now someone will say &quot;but you saaid&quot;. I know what I said. I never said it wasn&#39;t detonations, I said that those stated points were not true. Those explosions could have been produced by the building falling naturally. And beams could have lost their structural power without the need of explosives. What I want to point out is that even if the towers could have fell by themselves I think that they were detonated so that they don&#39;t kill even more people.
That way is a tragedy big enough to start a war, but you don&#39;t have to rebuild all the city.</p>

<p><strong>Forth point</strong>: There are lots of points in the official version that don&#39;t stand up. The visa, the training of the terrorists, the videos, them not knowing... stuff like that. Just read the rest of the comments and see for yourself.</p>

<p>War creates <strong>a lot</strong> of money for the usa. And they have one of the governments I trust the less of all the world, they do what it&#39;s good for their private economic interests only, even if that means killing, starting wars, or controlling the population. Remember that it is by far the government that expends more money to the military, and not just that, it&#39;s the country with more private military companies in the world. No war = no money, and there are a lot of big people there wanting that money and they don&#39;t care about a few deaths.</p>

<p>So, I might not have specific evidences about 9/11, but those points I stated are enough to make me know that something is wrong. I don&#39;t discard things like the planes being a decoy to detonate inside bombs, but they might have also been real planes too. Physically both options are plausible.</p>

<p>That&#39;s just my opinion tho.</p>

<p>Edit: some misspells and such.
Edit2: I&#39;m starting to change my mind in some of those points following this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3a67mc/10_reasons_why_911_was_demonstrably_an_inside_job/cs9zjzr">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3a67mc/10_reasons_why_911_was_demonstrably_an_inside_job/cs9zjzr</a></p>

<p>You&#39;re not an engineer. You&#39;re just one more moron who was fooled into believing the resistance of 93 x 1 floors is less than the resistance of 1 x 93 floors. You keep talking about the force of the top section and ignoring the resistance which should have existed in the bottom. You know, the resistance which had held that same weight for 40 years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What? Please explain yourself. What do you mean by 93x1 floors and 1x93 floors?</p>

<p>And are you talking about the first floor to fail or the following ones?</p>

<p>If you mean the first one: I didn&#39;t say the weight changed at all. I said the structure changed because of the heat and possibly by the crash and explosion itself. If a few beams stop working because they lost their properties because of the heat then the rest of the beams have to support what they were designed for + the weight of the ones that stopped working. Is that clear? If you have, let&#39;s say, 4 steel beams supporting the building and one stops being able to support anything, the rest 3 have to support more. Keep removing beams and at one point the rest of the beams fail and the floor collapses.</p>

<p>If you were talking about the rest of the floors that were collapsing later, it doesn&#39;t matter at all that those beams are in perfect shape because they no longer have to support the weight of the building. They have to support the weight + the impact generated from the upper floor collapsing. That impact is more than enough to destroy the floor.</p>

<p>See it this way: imagine I have a bowling ball and a wooden table. I put the bowling ball on top and the table doesn&#39;t have any problem supporting it. Now imagine I let the bowling ball fall from a height of say, 5m or so. The ball hits the table and it breaks. Ow! But it was able to support the ball just before! And the ball doesn&#39;t weight more! But it broke nonetheless. Is it clearer now?</p>

<p>I&#39;m just trying to point flaws in some of the points made here. I thought we were all open minded in this subreddit. ;) As I said I do believe in lot&#39;s of the things said here, but there are some other things that are just impossible and I think it&#39;s a good thing to point out them out and try to figure out what really happened, right?</p>

<p>It&#39;s perfectly clear what I mean. You&#39;re ignoring the incredible disparity in size and force between the damaged and non-damaged sections, and you&#39;re doing it by comparing the weight of the damaged section against just one floor at a time, rather than the total accumulative resistance of 93 floors it was at rest upon.</p>

<p>Basically, what you&#39;re saying is that only one floor resisted the falling mass at a time, and then once it had passed that floor, it was resisted by another, etc...</p>

<p>A nice analogy would be if I blew your house up and then claimed your chimney crushed it one brick at a time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, that&#39;s how it starts. First only one floor collapses, then the one below and so one. But that&#39;s only the first few floors because beams transmit force over a few floors so in the end forces are so big that lot&#39;s of floors collapse at the same time.</p>

<p>Anyway that&#39;s what you can also see in the videos. One floor collapses and then the ones directly below.</p>

When I say that a floor collapses I mean that the beams fail and the ceiling falls to the floor. There are easily 5m there, more than enough to gain enough speed to crush the next floor.

<p>No, there is not. Were there a distance between one floor and the next then we would be discussing a set of floating floors and not a solid building.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a silly little law called gravity that prevents concrete floors floating in mid-air.</p>

<p>The building was in mechanical equilibrium.

Oh, and a falling building doesn&#39;t weight (sic) any more than a non-falling one, Mr (bullshit) &quot;Engineer&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh man. I really don&#39;t care what you think about me, but it&#39;s not that hard to understand what I said.</p>

<p>Yes, you are right, a falling object doesn&#39;t have more &quot;weight&quot;, but you seem to understand physics too so we can talk about energy, right? Is it better if I tell you that beams have to support the weight of the building (constant) + have to dissipate the energy of the impact (extra because it&#39;s falling so it had a potential energy).</p>

<p>You know, you can see it this way too: F = m * a. Now the building is falling, say 5m at 9.81m/s² and then suddenly stops because it hits the lower floor. The top building was falling (velocity &gt; 0), and now is stop because it hit the lower floor, so there is an acceleration (derivative of velocity over time is acceleration), so there is a force. Who eats that force? The lower floor. Are there more forces in play? Yes, the weight. So we have that the lower floor has to support weight + impact force, that&#39;s why I said that it weighed more, but anyway, I shouldn&#39;t have said it that way. Is that enough to make the next floor collapse? No doubt. That&#39;s how buildings are demolished anyway, they don&#39;t put explosives in all floors.</p>

<p>Pressure is something that can push objects to the sides. There are more forces in a building collapsing than gravity, I just pointed out that because in those links they talked about that and it&#39;s just wrong.
And it doesn&#39;t matter. It doesn&#39;t have to be pressure alone, there are more horizontal forces there: Take a glass and throw it to the ground. Where do the pieces go? Oh! To the sides you say? All over the floor? So <strong>there are</strong> horizontal forces somehow! And it was just the gravity actuating!!</p>

<p>Feel free to ignore me or point out more things I said wrong instead of attacking me personally.
Have a good night, sir.</p>

<p>Absolute pleasure, brother. And thank you for the kind words.</p>

<p>I was just a few years older when it happened, but I&#39;m ashamed to say I was quite naive at the time. Like you, I didn&#39;t care about much and I guess I always just assumed our leaders were good people who would never be involved in something like that.</p>

<p>The turnaround for me happened around 2005, when one of my friends turned up with a copy of Loose Change. He was grinning like a madman, and kept telling me it was an inside job. I have to tell you that at the time I thought he&#39;d gone bonkers.</p>

<p>After seeing the video I remember thinking that if even ten percent of it was legitimate, then there was some kind of cover up going on. I still wasn&#39;t entirely convinced though. Then I watched Zeitgeist and it was at that point I decided to start researching it myself.</p>

<p>What really swayed me is that I was learning classical mechanics at the time, and it really helped me understand why the official explanation of the WTC collapses isn&#39;t physically possible. </p>

<p>From then on it&#39;s been like unravelling a ball of string. Over the last five or so years I&#39;ve really learned the extent to which the public&#39;s information is manipulated, and I&#39;ve learned just how truly evil and insane the people who are doing it are.</p>

<p>I misrepresented no article, so stop wasting people&#39;s time, stop misrepresenting ridiculous on-the-spot guesses as &quot;theories&quot; and gtfo you stupid Hasbara troll. The very first line of the article is:-</p>

<p><strong>There is no indication that any of the fires in the World Trade Center buildings were hot enough to melt the steel framework</strong></p>

<p>Following on:-</p>

<p><strong>Jonathan Barnett, professor of fire protection engineering, has repeatedly reminded the public that steel--which has a melting point of 2,800 degrees Fahrenheit--may weaken and bend, but does not melt during an ordinary office fire. Yet metallurgical studies on WTC steel brought back to WPI reveal that a novel phenomenon--called a eutectic reaction--occurred at the surface, causing intergranular melting capable of turning a solid steel girder into Swiss cheese.</strong></p>

<p>The biggest question is that did &quot;anyone&quot; have any early intelligence that this was going to happen?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The US government was aware of the airplanes as weapons plot as early as 1994, when they interrogated Ramzi Yousef and found out about Project Bojinka. They were aware specifically that the WTC was a target. In fact, in 1994 itself, there were three attempted attacks on US buildings using planes, which proves the claim that this type of attack was unprecedented is an egregious lie. It was during the mid 1990s that the FBI began investigating flight schools.</p>

<p>A good book to read if you&#39;re interested in the facts about the intelligence is: The War On Truth: 9/11, Disinformation And The Anatomy Of Terrorism. It will really open your eyes.</p>

<p>In other words, engineers account for various stresses that a building can experience. </p>

<p>In NIST&#39;s report, they took out the studs, the stiffeners, changed the beam sizes, took away the column footings and took away the concrete. </p>

<p>And back to the purposefully vague ad hominems. Can&#39;t you at least put in some effort and build a straw man argument? You&#39;re just being lazy now.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Simply not true. Stop getting your information from NIST because NIST keeps changing its story. In 2008, NIST claimed there were no steel studs in order to support its final model of collapse, but this directly contradicts what it said in 2005. </p>

<p>This video proves that the WTC had shear studs, and shows the actual WTC blueprints:-</p>

<p><a href="http://911blogger.com/news/2012-02-04/wtc7-and-nist-shear-ignorance">http://911blogger.com/news/2012-02-04/wtc7-and-nist-shear-ignorance</a></p>

<p>More importantly, each main WTC tower was surrounded by a perimeter of 47 core support columns. Hence, a <em>symmetrical</em> collapse would require the <em>simultaneous</em> failure of all of them at once.</p>

<p>Explain me one thing: Apparently jet fuel can&#39;t melt steel beams. But can it weaken them?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Explain me this:-</p>

<p><strong>According to a member of New York Air National Guard’s 109th Air Wing, who is at Ground Zero from September 22 to October 6: “One fireman told us that there was still molten steel at the heart of the towers’ remains. Firemen sprayed water to cool the debris down but the heat remained intense enough at the surface to melt their boots.”</strong> [NATIONAL GUARD MAGAZINE, 12/2001] </p>

<p><strong>New York firefighters recall “heat so intense they encountered rivers of molten steel.”</strong> [NEW YORK POST, 3/3/2004] </p>

<p><strong>Ron Burger, a public health advisor who arrives at Ground Zero on September 12, says that “feeling the heat” and “seeing the molten steel” there reminds him of a volcano.</strong> [NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH ASSOCIATION, 9/2003, P40] </p>

<p><strong>Alison Geyh, who heads a team of scientists studying the potential health effects of 9/11, reports: “Fires are still actively burning and the smoke is very intense. In some pockets now being uncovered, they are finding molten steel.”</strong> [JOHN HOPKINS PUBLIC HEALTH MAGAZINE, 2001] </p>

<p><strong>William Langewiesche, the only journalist to have unrestricted access to Ground Zero during the cleanup operation, describes, “in the early days, the streams of molten metal that leaked from the hot cores and flowed down broken walls inside the foundation hole.”</strong> [LANGEWIESCHE, 2002, PP. 32] </p>

<p><strong>Ken Holden, who is involved with the organizing of demolition, excavation and debris removal operations at Ground Zero, later will tell the 9/11 Commission, “Underground, it was still so hot that molten metal dripped down the sides of the wall from [WTC] Building 6.”</strong> [9/11 COMMISSION, 4/1/2003] </p>

<p><strong>Leslie Robertson, one of the structural engineers responsible for the design of the WTC, describes fires still burning and molten steel still running 21 days after the attacks.</strong> [SEAU NEWS, 10/2001] </p>

<p>First a bit about my stance.   I really believe more that its a conspiracy than what were told there&#39;s just too many things that fail to add up. </p>

<p>The only thing that I can&#39;t figure and this is my question.  How do you pull off what would be an enormous operation without someone at least saying hang on this isn&#39;t right? </p>

<p>I mean take to rig the buildings with explosives is I imagine a pretty big job and how do you convince people to fly planes to their death. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to be clever and pick holes,  I&#39;m genuinely a skeptic just trying to figure things out.</p>

<p>Do you mean ethically? Well, Zionists don&#39;t really have a code of ethics where non-Zionists are concerned. You can consider Zionism to be an ideology similar to Nazism in that Zionists see themselves as racially (and intellectually) superior to everyone else.</p>

<p>Aside from pretty much all the documented and circumstantial evidence pointing to Zionists, false flag attacks are an Israeli speciality. They&#39;ve done it before, on numerous occasions.</p>

<p>Sheer common sense stipulates that it is not a coincidence NORAD couldn&#39;t respond on that particular morning because it was busy conducting simulated hijacking exercises. That&#39;s on top of the named hijackers all having handed in &quot;incomprehensible&quot; VISA applications.</p>

<p>Basically, it couldn&#39;t be more obvious. That&#39;s why it&#39;s both amazing and horrifying that they&#39;ve gotten away with it. Their story is ludicrous. They&#39;ve gotten away with it purely because of their control over our society and its information.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It undoubtedly was a big job, but that&#39;s no reason to assume it didn&#39;t happen. I don&#39;t know the exact details of how it was achieved any more than you do. The only way I could know that is if I actually did it.</p>

<p>As regards how you could convince someone to fly a plane into a building, then that&#39;s fairly simple. You kidnap their family and threaten to kill them if they don&#39;t comply.</p>

<p>Yeah, that&#39;s putting it mildly. Obviously my knowledge of the case is limited, but if it&#39;s true he was right-handed and shot himself in the left side of the head, then I really don&#39;t know how that can go down as a suicide. </p>

<p>How would the Boeing 757 that apparently &quot;crashed&quot; into the side of the pentagon leave no discernible wreckage and a hole that is only 14-16 feet wide. Also, the fuel from the plane would have burned for a few days and would&#39;ve prompted a soil cleanup, yet none of those things ever happened. That just seems strange to me. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not the first time a plane has flown into the building, but perhaps it was the first time a plane of that size had flown into a building...</p>

<p>As for the claims, of course I&#39;ve seen them. They have all been thoroughly debunked. I could just ignore them, but I&#39;m instead giving you a chance to convince me these are actual problems.</p>

<p>Now, instead of arguing about why I&#39;m here or questioning my person like you are now, let&#39;s discuss the topic, shall we?</p>

<p>First of all, you mentioned the fact that a plane this size had newer flewn into a building of this size, as if to say it means something. What does it mean, exactly? You do mention:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Any aircraft that flew into buildings never did even a fraction of the damage that occurred in those events that day</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does that fact have any worth in itself? Not really, unless you take into consideration the speed the plane was flying in, the mass of the plane, the fuel, how it hit the building etc.</p>

<p>Taking all the factors into consideration leaves us with a very proportional amount of damage. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>This claim is weird in many ways. The first obvious thing this insinuates is that the planes weren&#39;t flown by a person at all. What then, I ask? </p>

<p>What was so very special about what the hijackers did, that not a single pilot would be able to do? </p>

<p>Feel free to actually respond to my questions and concerns. It won&#39;t hurt, I promise.</p>

When a society has no respect for the personal sovereignty of its people and the people themselves defer their free will to any other body, things have gone badly wrong.

That there are still people who so badly need to believe that it was anything less than surreal shows just how weak we have become in registering our own observations over the official story.

Oh, I almost forgot to mention: He also had the presence of mind to turn off the transponder in the middle of this incredibly difficult maneuver ...

<p>This is extremely dangerous thinking. The common goal of the false flag attack is analogous to the mafia&#39;s bread and butter protection rackets. That is, they send some guys to hurt you, then they send some more guys to &quot;protect&quot; you from the first guys, and usually charge you for the privilege. Then, when nobody else hurts you, they claim their &quot;protection&quot; must be working, and so they keep demanding you pay them.</p>

<p>There are so many fallacies which have been distributed into the thinking processes of ordinary people because of this event, and this is one of them. Another analogy might be for me to charge you money for &quot;protecting&quot; you from aliens. If you question the validity of paying me, I can simply claim that since no aliens have attacked you, then my protection must be working.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me, it&#39;s not even so much 9/11 itself that&#39;s so important... it&#39;s the implications.</p>

<p>If you figure out 9/11 was an inside job, it logically follows that the western press is willing to lie, in concert, to conceal the mass murder of nearly 3,000 people AND to lie to promote wars that killed more than a million. Which implies that our news is not really news, but mere propaganda. And that implies that nearly all TV and movies, which support the original lie in subtle or not-so-subtle ways, are part of the propaganda network. And public education, which supports it, is part of it. As are many, if not most churches.</p>

<p>This calls into question not only current events, but indeed our entire &quot;known&quot; history.</p>

<p>It implies that the majority of the western world is living in a schizophrenic bubble, an artificial reality if you will, controlled by criminal oligarchs. (Indeed, most likely the whole world is kept within bubbles of various sorts... but I don&#39;t speak enough languages to be able to confirm.)</p>

<p>To me, that&#39;s the real mindfuck of 9/11:</p>

<p>We&#39;re living in an fake reality.</p>

<p>Whoa.</p>

<p>Once you know what really happened on 9/11, the whole deception just logically unravels.</p>

<p>I suppose you could get there from Sandy Hook or Boston Bombing or even Alex Jones... but 9/11 is just such a straight shot.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a big fan of this documentary; it&#39;s reasonably short, well-made, and gives you a good push down the rabbithole of implications:</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I just think this shows the extent of control Zionists have over you, your thoughts and your life. First you are encouraged to believe conspiracy theories are stupid. Then you are convinced that refuting or even questioning the events of 9/11 makes you a conspiracy theorist.  Then, if you question the events of 9/11, you are stupid. This false syllogism is so simple, so easy to refute, and yet it is simultaneously so powerful that it catches millions in its net.</p>

<p>It&#39;s effectively just a slight variation on the ancient &quot;Emperor Has No Clothes&quot; fallacy. Your opinion is decided for you by your own fear of ridicule.</p>

<p>Right wing Conservatism in America has become pretty much synonymous with Zionism. They are unapologetically biased towards Israel, and it&#39;s through the diligent work of Zionists that this has become the case. </p>

<p>These ones:-</p>

<p><strong>Formed in 1997 by fanatical Zionist extremists William Kristol and Robert Kagan, the Project for a New American Century (PNAC), operated as an aggressive and hugely influential foreign policy think tank. The membership was overwhelmingly militarized Zionists with bulging political muscle.  Some of these were Richard Perle, Paul Wolfowitz, Eliot Cohen, Lewis Libby, and the author of “Rebuilding America’s Defenses (RAD)”, probable high level 9/11 architect, Rabbi Dov Zakheim.</strong></p>

<p><strong>In the 2000 RAD document, in addition to prophesizing multiple, simultaneous wars, the suspicious reference to Pearl Harbor reappears and the author, Rabbi Dov Zakheim, seems to clamor for it: “the process of transformation is likely to be a long one, absent some catastrophic catalyzing event — like a New Pearl Harbor.”</strong></p>

<p>In fact, as the article makes clear, we aren&#39;t discussing one study, but multiple studies which all yield comparable results.

<p>Total nonsense. The &quot;few hundred tons of metal&quot; you describe was at rest and hence had no distance with which to gather up the speed you claim it developed.</p>

<p>The distance doesn&#39;t really matter either. If a tower loses its structural integrity, it collapses. </p>

<p>I guess it&#39;s a fair question, but it has an obvious and unremarkable answer. The power and control of Zionism over the media and political institutions in America (and indeed the west) is vast, but it isn&#39;t absolutely total. At least not to the point where they can initiate a total news blackout. News organisations are going to run news, and there&#39;s only so much anybody can do to interfere with that process.</p>

<p>The control of Zionism however, is still evident.</p>

<p>You will notice that yes, while the individual articles I have linked do build a very startling picture, they all nevertheless try to explain the evidence in terms which still fit with the general parameters of the lie. For example, the story about fifteen of the hijackers being given full US VISAS in exchange for &quot;incomprehensible&quot; application forms frames it as a &quot;staggering lapse&quot; on the part of the US State Department. Does that seem more likely to you to be a &quot;staggering lapse&quot; or a deliberate act?</p>

<p>Similarly, although the Pakistani Foreign Secretary was informed several months prior to 9/11 that Afghanistan was about to be invaded by the US, at no point does the BBC make the connection that the events of 9/11 were almost certainly intended to facilitate this cause.</p>

<p>Again, consider the story run by several different American agencies about a number of Israelis being caught with a truck full of explosives on George Washington bridge. This story even hit the Jerusalem Post. It was confirmed news. However, the video story was later completely retracted, vanished from the internet everywhere except Youtube and private blog sites, and as far as I&#39;m aware the official stance is now that this event did not even happen.</p>

<p>You can bet too that had the FBI not arrested and detained the five Israelis caught celebrating at Doric towers, that story would also have disappeared from the news.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I believe you. You seem genuine.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Heck, your sources lose more and more credibility as you go on,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Might have a point there, but I was running out of ideas and I figured everybody that was going to be convinced would have already been convinced by the time they read that the WTC steel resembled &quot;Swiss cheese&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You start off with FEMA, BBC, ABC and then go to Urban Dictionary</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, I posted that simply because it was well-worded. It explains beautifully the sheer absurdity of believing bin Laden sent a video confession  to the US authorities. His identity was confirmed during two public interviews in which he denied all knowledge or involvement. Then he offered to stand trial in Pakistan to prove he had nothing to do with it. Here is a good source for that:-</p>

<p><strong>In late September and early October, leaders of Pakistan&#39;s two Islamic parties negotiated bin Laden&#39;s extradition to Pakistan to stand trial for the September 11 attacks.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The deal was that he would be held under house arrest in Peshawar. According to reports in Pakistan (and the Daily Telegraph), this had both bin Laden&#39;s approval and that of Mullah Omah, the Taliban leader.</strong> (Ahmed 2005, p96)</p>

<p><em>AHMED, NAFEEZ MOSADDEQ, 2005, The War On Truth: 9/11, Disinformation And The Anatomy Of Terrorism. Moreton-In-Marsh, Gloucestershire, England: Arris Publishing Ltd.</em></p>

<p>So, a bit of U-turn for him to then cheerfully admit it on video and for that video to end up in the hands of the US authorities. In fact, let&#39;s not be shy and just call it what it is: a complete fucking miracle.</p>

<p>And, going back to my earlier point about how much control Zionist spin doctors have over the media, consider Professor Bruce Lawrence&#39;s point. In the &quot;confession video&quot;, and also in later (post 2001) videos, the person purporting himself to be bin Laden was wearing jewellery -- something the actual bin Laden had never done because it was forbidden by his religion.</p>

<p>And yet, the media gave nothing more than a passing mention to this categoric proof that the tape was not genuine. I suppose it is even more bizarre than when they discovered the hijackers binge drinking, nightclubbing and having sex with prostitutes, and somehow tried to convince people they were &quot;impersonating&quot; the enemy. These things all directly contradict the story about devoutly religious madmen attacking us because of their insane religious beliefs.</p>

<p>The entire thing has been a setup, from start to finish. It has consummately annihilated my faith in the human race. All I see now are the lies and manipulation of a culture of evil which has infiltrated us by pretending to be our friend.</p>

<p>The culture of Zionism is deception. You literally cannot believe a word that somebody says once they are revealed to be a Zionist, because they are the most ruthless and calculated liars in the history of history.</p>

<p>It&#39;s by far the most probable cause, and one which any scientist should have tested for. The additional fact that large portions of the steel resembled &quot;Swiss cheese&quot; makes it pretty much conclusive.</p>

<p>Again with the lies. Only a liar would call the office fires in the WTC severe. They affected no more than a few floors at the top of the building.</p>

<p>The WTC buildings were brought down in a controlled demolition and it&#39;s as simple as that. The only thing which turns solid steel into &quot;Swiss cheese&quot; are explosives.</p>

I&#39;m very much into conspiracy theories yet I&#39;m always questioning my beliefs whether conspiratorial or not. It blows my mind the stupid shit I used to believe and that people do believe right now. I live with someone right now that&#39;s trying to get me to believe that the earth is flat but he has no proof or even decent ideas as to why the earth would be flat. It&#39;s mainly because some random guy on youtube says so. I know how sick and twisted our government is, their incredulous actions know no bounds. I wish people had the veracity to realize that they&#39;re wrong sometimes and accept it. I&#39;ve fallen prey to so many people who dispersed information that turned out to be verifiably wrong, and I think those people knew all along that they were full of shit.</p>

<p>But I&#39;ll take a quick shot at it:</p>

<p>1- Metal corrosion: a &quot;question&quot;, not evidence of anything particular.</p>

<p>2- Hijackers visa applications: if this was deliberate conspiracy, wouldn&#39;t the govt have made sure their visa applications were convincing, worth approving ?</p>

<p>3- Predicted action against Afghanistan: could  mean anything.  More missile strikes, as Clinton did in the 90&#39;s ?</p>

<p>4- Thermite: refuted by <a href="http://aneta.org/911experiments_com/millette/paper/index.htm">http://aneta.org/911experiments_com/millette/paper/index.htm</a>  CT&#39;s say &quot;but those aren&#39;t the same red/gray chips !&quot;  Who knows ?  Seems unproven to me.</p>

<p>5- Bin Laden tape is a fraud: critiquing OBL&#39;s language and the rings he&#39;s wearing seems pretty thin to me.</p>

<p>6- Israelis dancing: see <a href="http://www.911myths.com/html/dancing_israelis.html">http://www.911myths.com/html/dancing_israelis.html</a></p>

<p>7- Psychological study of CT&#39;s: irrelevant.</p>

<p>8- Cheney ordered no shoot down of Pentagon plane:  seems to be an isolated statement by one witness, Mineta.  He says it was some time after the shoot-down order was given, which was 9:50 according to <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/911-when-did-cheney-authorize-the-shoot-down-of-civilian-planes/5425959">http://www.globalresearch.ca/911-when-did-cheney-authorize-the-shoot-down-of-civilian-planes/5425959</a>  Flight 77 hit Pentagon at 9:37 according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Flight_77">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Flight_77</a></p>

<p>9- Who gained: not evidence of any conspiracy; just speculation.</p>

<p>10-  Pilot who wrote 9/11 book is dead:  not evidence of any conspiracy; just speculation.  And why would anyone kill him AFTER the book comes out, instead of BEFORE ?</p>

<p>Only item 4 has any potential to be evidence of a conspiracy, and it seems to be refuted.  If someone can duplicate the positive-for-thermite tests and establish a clear chain of evidence from the 9/11 site to the lab, that would be good evidence.  I think that has not been done.</p>

<p>Stop calling it a study. I&#39;ve read it and it&#39;s a crock of lies which he can&#39;t get peer-reviewed for exactly that reason. One of his central arguments is that Harrit confused thermite with aluminium paint, which is a hypothesis Harrit disproved <em>in his own paper!</em></p>

<p>He also claims Harrit has no &quot;verifiable chain of custody&quot; for the four independent samples he used, which he goes on to argue means we should discount his results. Not only is he lying about there being no verifiable chain of custody, but since the samples all came from separate strangers and yet yielded identical results, this alone rules out contamination. You can also add to that the problem of where anybody is going to get hold of military grade thermite, how they&#39;re going to infuse it into some WTC samples, and why they&#39;d even do something so bizarre in the first place.</p>

<p>When forensics investigators stumble across vital evidence several days, weeks or even months after a crime has taken place, they do not throw it away because it has &quot;no verifiable chain of custody&quot;.</p>

<p>In sum, the &quot;study&quot; to which you refer is a total and complete crock of shit, it is doubtful whether whoever wrote it has even read Harrit&#39;s paper, I&#39;m still not convinced Millete is even a real person, and even if he is nobody in the scientific community is going to pass  that shit through the peer-review process, on the grounds that he&#39;s just making stuff up and hoping nobody notices.</p>

<p>None of that affects my evaluation of 9/11, which is:  the govt explanation has evidence and makes sense; the conspiracy theories have NO evidence and often make no sense.</p>

<p>Lol. It has absolutely no evidence. The conspiracy theory you&#39;re touting on their behalf is contradicted by the most fundamental laws of physics. Show us some evidence, and watch it get laughed out of the thread. Perhaps you&#39;d like to show us the NIST report. The one which completely ignored the damage to the WTC steel reported by Barnett.</p>

<p>Or perhaps you&#39;d like to explain why you posted a link to an unpublished paper which can&#39;t get past peer-review, and tried to use it to &quot;debunk&quot; a published paper which has passed peer review four times.</p>

<p>Clearly, you&#39;re either a troll or just a massive idiot. I don&#39;t suppose it matters which.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the way the truth movement predictably spun their crushing defeat. The more logical way to look at it is that a group of trained professionals voted against the truth movement because it&#39;s dumber than dogshit. </p>

<p>Evidence that supports the govt explanation: video of the hijackers in the airports</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you were shown CCTV of some people standing in an airport, and that proves what exactly? That some people were standing in an airport. It doesn&#39;t prove they hijacked anything. It isn&#39;t evidence, so please shut up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>video and eyewitnesses of planes hitting the buildings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And this proves that Arabs were responsible how? It isn&#39;t evidence so please shut up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>records of hijackers entering the USA</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And records that their VISA applications were &quot;incomprehensible&quot;. Hence, this is evidence of an inside job, not evidence of the reverse.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>records of hijackers taking flight lessons. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>From an ex-Israeli military instructor called Eddie Shalev. When Shalev received them, they were incapable of flying a single engine Cessna, and yet according to his records they were competent pilots.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>phone calls from passengers saying &quot;we&#39;re being hijacked&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Never happened. What did happen is that Betty Ong (a flight attendant) used the plane&#39;s phone to call in and claim Daniel Lewin shot another passenger with a pistol. Daniel Lewin was the only Israeli to die in the attacks. This was reported on at the time, but within a matter of hours the story had been changed, Lewin suddenly became the victim, not the attacker, and the gun became a knife/box cutter.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>cockpit voice recorders showing struggles.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Never happened. You&#39;re just making stuff up now.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>accidental radio transmissions of the hijackers voices from the planes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Never happened. None of the pilots even reported that they were being hijacked, for which there is a standard procedure to follow. It begins with the transmission of a private code to air traffic control.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bin Laden claiming responsibility</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Have you even read the OP? The foremost bin Laden expert in the world literally laughed when he was shown the alleged &quot;confession&quot; video. How stupid do you actually have to be to be fooled by that? Bin Laden is on public record denying all involvement twice, and then he offered to stand trial in Pakistan and prove his own innocence.</p>

<p>You must really be a special kind of naive.</p>

<p><strong>I have already said that I am not involved in the 11 September attacks in the United States. As a Muslim, I try my best to avoid telling a lie. I had no knowledge of these attacks, nor do I consider the killing of innocent women, children, and other humans as an appreciable act. Islam strictly forbids causing harm to innocent women, children, and other people...</strong></p>

<p><strong>Whoever committed the act of 11 September are not the friends of the American people. I have already said that we are against the American system, not against its people, whereas in these attacks, the common American people have been killed...</strong></p>

<p>You sound like a smug thief who knows he&#39;s worn gloves. </p>

<p>Unfortunately for you, there is concrete proof that it did happen. It is not disputed that Cheney issued the order. The only dispute is whether the order was to shoot down flight 77 or not shoot it down. If the order was to shoot it down, then there would be no reason to question it a second time given that it was known by this time the plane had been hijacked and was headed directly for the Pentagon. Additionally, if the order was to shoot the plane down, then the plane would have been shot down -- instead of hurtling into the Pentagon completely unopposed by any form of defence or resistance.</p>

<p>So there you go, proof that it happened.</p>

<p>Demanding Zionists are made accountable for the crimes they commit against the people of this planet is quite clearly not anti-Semitic. Last year your evil brethren were carpet bombing Semites, so please just stfu you idiotic animal.</p>

<p>You are reversing the facts. The government invented a conspiracy theory to explain the events of 9/11, and it was debunked by qualified academics. Claiming to &quot;debunk&quot; the debunkers is retarded. Literally retarded.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a pretty accurate description of what has happened. These guys have used their control over the socio-political structure to sell their story through sheer repetition.

<p>The Millette study contradicts Harrit</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Stop calling it a study. I&#39;ve read it and it&#39;s a crock of lies which he can&#39;t get peer-reviewed for exactly that reason. One of his central arguments is that Harrit confused thermite with aluminium paint, which is a hypothesis Harrit disproved <em>in his own paper!</em></p>

<p>He also claims Harrit has no &quot;verifiable chain of custody&quot; for the four independent samples he used, which he goes on to argue means we should discount his results. Not only is he lying about there being no verifiable chain of custody, but since the samples all came from separate strangers and yet yielded identical results, this alone rules out contamination. You can also add to that the problem of where anybody is going to get hold of military grade thermite, how they&#39;re going to infuse it into some WTC samples, and why they&#39;d even do something so bizarre in the first place.</p>

<p>When forensics investigators stumble across vital evidence several days, weeks or even months after a crime has taken place, they do not throw it away because it has &quot;no verifiable chain of custody&quot;.</p>

<p>In sum, the &quot;study&quot; to which you refer is a total and complete crock of shit, it is doubtful whether whoever wrote it has even read Harrit&#39;s paper, I&#39;m still not convinced Millete is even a real person, and even if he is nobody in the scientific community is going to pass  that shit through the peer-review process, on the grounds that he&#39;s just making stuff up and hoping nobody notices.</p>

<p>I also don&#39;t quite get what you&#39;re getting on about. Dynamic loads are harder to support than static loads as you need to decelerate something which requires extra force. That&#39;s a fact of classical physics. </p>

<p>When I say counteract forces of gravity, that is the loading. The loading due to gravity of all the weight it needs to support, for which it was designed on a static basis. The only other loading is from wind forces.</p>

<p>This is like carrying a bowling ball in your hand (static problem, quite easy to do), versus stopping the ball after it has dropped ten feet. Oh and if your hand moved down by more an inch or two, the support (your hand) breaks and it keeps falling.</p>

<p>Basically, it couldn&#39;t be more obvious. That&#39;s why it&#39;s both amazing and horrifying that they&#39;ve gotten away with it. Their story is ludicrous. They&#39;ve gotten away with it purely because of their control over our society and its information.</p>

Your refusal to debate the evidence presented in opposition to your views is an implicit concession that your argument is weak and not borne out by the facts.

<p>You need to begin by explaining where the extra downward force came from which pushed the top 17 floors through the bottom 93 floors (which contained the accumulative resistance of half a million tons of concrete and steel). It can&#39;t come from gravity, because the effect of gravity is constant and yet the buildings were in a state of mechanical equilibrium. Hence, there was as much resistance pushing back up as there was pushing downwards.</p>

<p>And therefore, what your 2,000 words of rubbish says in plain English is that the acceleration of gravity increased. </p>

<p>Since those of us who are not liars or idiots know this did not happen, therefore something destroyed the resistance in the bottom 93 floors of building, and thus gravity brought the damaged section straight down to the ground.</p>

<p>Now, you can write me ten thousand more words of number-based nonsense if you like, but of those two explanations, only one is physically possible.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to make a few assumptions to make the math easier. Let&#39;s assume a uniform distribution of mass. A little research tells me that the buildings weigh 1.5 million tons.</p>

<p>They weighed half a million tons each you goddamned offensively stupid, delusionally arrogant nightmare. When you say &quot;research&quot;, what you mean is you picked the first result from the top of Google and didn&#39;t look any further.</p>

<p>It falls to the path of least resistance, which is off the side of the building.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What force is pushing it to the side? When the structural support snaps the path of least resistance is DOWN because it is no longer being supported as it succumbs to gravity. It collapses under its own weight. There&#39;s no perpendicular force!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It falls down. Onto itself. Because it can no longer support the weight of the above 17 floors. There is nothing pushing it sideways. What universe do you live in where gravity is pulling everything sideways? You&#39;re grasping at straws now. </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t really make much sense that you would mean that, but I suppose I will take your word for it, based on the content of your other posts. This one was the curve ball.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Well now that clearly isn&#39;t true, is it? I didn&#39;t call you stupid. I said what you wrote was stupid. In the context I had taken it in, it was stupid. I have seen many trolls argue that there were no explosive sounds in the WTC. It is one of their favourite lies. In light of that, it is a remarkable coincidence that you did not mean it in this way, wouldn&#39;t you agree? Remarkable that in fact you have watched multiple videos of the WTC collapses and none of them have ever had sound.</p>
