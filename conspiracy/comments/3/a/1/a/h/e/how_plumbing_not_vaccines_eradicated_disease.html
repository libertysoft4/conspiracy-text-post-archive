        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Vaccines have been around for decades and gotten all the rage for getting rid of diseases. Plumber’s say that sewage systems and clean water eradicate diseases.</p>

<p>Europeans didn’t like bathing after the fall of the Roman Empire, and they believed that getting wet caused illnesses. This continued through the Dark Ages. Europeans went against local customs by bathing, but this was done over the protest. Queen Elizabeth bathed, her servants panicked, fearing she would become ill and die.</p>

<p>This bathing resistance would finally come across the ocean into America, which would influence habits into the 1800s. In 1835, Philadelphia had almost passed an ordinance that would forbid wintertime bathing. After ten years, Boston outlawed bathing, except by medical directive.</p>

<p>Polio disease lives in fecal matter and is transmitted easily through human waste. Plumbing and water sanitation in India are behind than the rest of the industrialized world. Areas where sanitation and hygiene are good, polio is rare. Where there are poor hygiene and sanitation, polio can spread easily.</p>

<p>Vaccines have gotten a lot of credibility for India being declared “polio free” by WHO. India reported 762 cases of polio in 2009 and these numbers made them the polio capital of the world. In 2014, there are no official documented cases of polio, but without proper sanitation there is no way this can last. India is the second most populated nation in the world, with a population estimated at 1.2 billion. 780 million Indians don’t have a toilet; 96 million of them don’t have access to clean drinking water. Open defecation is more common than attempting to dispose of human waste in a more sanitary way.</p>

<p>The infant mortality rate in Europe in the 1800s was high, from 25 to 70 percent. London had little as far as water infrastructure. Many people used town pumps and communal wells to get their drinking water. Waste disposal was far from neat. Most people dumped their waste in open pits that were known as “cesspools” or directly into the Thames River. But, the river was also the drinking source for some people.</p>

<p>Cholera also spreads through contaminated water and food, killing quickly and often proves fatal within hours of the first symptoms of vomiting or diarrhea. In 1854, an outbreak hit London that claimed the lives of tens of thousands of Europeans. In Soho, there were more than 500 fatal cases of cholera in ten days.
Sanitation prevents diseases because it removes the cause of disease transmission. Smallpox continued to hit Europe until plumbing became common. Although, sanitation ended the disease, the smallpox vaccine takes the credit. But, there are statistics that placed fatalities from the vaccine as high as one in 200.
Vaccines usually contain chemicals like aluminum and mercury, many vaccines also contain aborted fetal tissues. So, medical professionals and pharmaceutical companies are fast to take credit; they’re not the ones that could be thanked. Have you thanked a plumber lately?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree and here&#39;s why.</p>

<p>Acquired immunity gained through mild exposure is a huge and well demonstrated part of our immune systems functions. Vaccines have been proven to grant acquired immunity, debating that is pseudoscience. </p>

<p>Polio in the 1920s was believed to be a &quot;white disease&quot; because black communities were so less likely to become victims. The reality was, poor communities with poorer hygiene were far less likely to have severe polio infections and the severity of the disease worsened the later in life someone contracted it. A similar trend is observed in people that contract chicken pox late in life. These poor hygiene conditions meant that children were exposed to the polio much younger in life in moderately safe levels and as a result built up a resistance to the the virus.</p>

<p>Those with access to proper hygiene and plumbing were rarely exposed to the virus, so they were never able to build up a defense to it, so when they eventually were exposed the virus was better able to wreck havoc on their bodies. </p>

<p>Yes, hygiene and plumbing are EXTREMELY important and vital to the elimination of infectious diseases. However it&#39;s impossible to remain in perfectly hygienic environments constantly and vaccines help maintain a robust immune system while not exposing children to far more dangerous live pathogens or perpetuating the pathogen&#39;s existence. Plumbing and vaccination work in concert to eliminate diseases. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t say plumbing is <em>entirely</em> the reason, but, IMO, when it&#39;s factored in, the risks of vaccines in-general outweigh the benefits, which have been deliberately exaggerated by excluding things like sanitation and other lifestyle improvements.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It may be more correct to say that epidemiology, rather than plumbing saves lives. The well-known story of the doc who had the handle taken off a public water pump after tracing the source of cholera and cut off the epidemic in London is considered the first instance of the science. Also remember that folks were vaccinating themselves against smallpox with cowpox, by the 1700&#39;s.</p>

<p>If plumbing were the sole reason for eradicating disease, and so many Indians have shitty plumbing, then why is the number only 762? If it&#39;s all down to the plumbing to eradicate disease, shouldn&#39;t the number of infected be substantially higher? </p>
