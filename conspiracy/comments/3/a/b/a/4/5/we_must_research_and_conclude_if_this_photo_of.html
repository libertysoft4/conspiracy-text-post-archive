        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>EDIT 2</strong>: In this interest of this being sort of a broadcast that I suppose I created, I have to say 24hrs later I feel that what is most likely is that this program may just be picking up on the bright colors in this image. However if anyone has expertise or experience with this type of work, ELAs or things like that, your input would be highly appreciated.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Hey all. </p>

<p>I&#39;m making this post because I feel like this is important and other people may be able to shed light on this. </p>

<p>So essentially there is a method of photo analysis called an ELA. Basically if a photo is unedited it will display similar level of compression all over. However, if its a jpg, and someone has edited it, it will display varying levels of compression and thus give itself away as an edited photo.</p>

<p>So. Here is an example, on this forensics website you can see that someone has just photoshopped the Jesus face onto this weed (this is one photo they use as an example):</p>

<p><a href="http://fotoforensics.com/analysis.php?challenge=1&amp;id=9d40f53a05ca7cc7932ccc09b260312e9e3372c3.208035">http://fotoforensics.com/analysis.php?challenge=1&amp;id=9d40f53a05ca7cc7932ccc09b260312e9e3372c3.208035</a></p>

<p>Obviously fake. As a control I have here this photo of a cat which has not been edited, you can see it displays a similar level of compression all over (I suspect someone applied a subtle instagram filter to this, that&#39;s why it&#39;s slightly &quot;edgy&quot;, but still totally uniform):</p>

<p><a href="http://fotoforensics.com/analysis.php?id=631a71d9e7fa032c48a6468698e638a42287e74d.88871">http://fotoforensics.com/analysis.php?id=631a71d9e7fa032c48a6468698e638a42287e74d.88871</a></p>

<p>Now, we have this photo of the shooter from SC. In fact in one photo he&#39;s wearing two patches: one from apartheid South Africa and one from Rhodesia. My my! That is incriminating as hell!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/dylann-roof-charleston-shooting-suspect-had-rhodesia-south-africa-apartheid-jacket-1506881">http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/dylann-roof-charleston-shooting-suspect-had-rhodesia-south-africa-apartheid-jacket-1506881</a></p>

<p>But, could someone have altered this photo in some way? Let&#39;s check using the ELA:</p>

<p><a href="http://fotoforensics.com/analysis.php?id=ffdd438724ace64b49b5eddb45a36b255c65d3cd.105386">http://fotoforensics.com/analysis.php?id=ffdd438724ace64b49b5eddb45a36b255c65d3cd.105386</a></p>

<p>Interesting as FUCK. Sure seems suspicious to me. For the record I work in some capacity with photoshop, so I can say it looks slightly edited, but that means nothing compared to a real analysis like this.</p>

<p>I&#39;m hoping in this thread, we can discuss this, and perhaps someone that knows more about ELAs, etc. can shed some light on this. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: For everyone saying the photo of the shooter doesn&#39;t look the same as the modified example: I know. I used the most obviously modified one as an example here. Here is a more subtle example from the site that matches the ELA variation in the photo of the shooter. All over we have this white and black fuzzy pattern, but the edited area displays rainbow colors and compression variation <strong>not found</strong> in the rest of the image:</p>

<p><a href="http://fotoforensics.com/analysis.php?challenge=1&amp;id=33aafc53251dbed136bf79fb0ef597c7838bded5.52461">http://fotoforensics.com/analysis.php?challenge=1&amp;id=33aafc53251dbed136bf79fb0ef597c7838bded5.52461</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s another photoshopped version of the image which displays variation like the photo of the shooter (dense rainbow lines and pattern indicating variation <strong>not found anywhere else in the photo</strong>, just like the ELA analysis of the shooter photo:</p>

<p><a href="http://fotoforensics.com/analysis.php?challenge=1&amp;id=f55625fca882ce0fc79012d514524108566d26b1.487266">http://fotoforensics.com/analysis.php?challenge=1&amp;id=f55625fca882ce0fc79012d514524108566d26b1.487266</a></p>

<p>Shooter photo ELA for comparison. If you open these up in tabs with the Kim Jong Un photos side by side you will see the similarity:</p>

<p><a href="http://fotoforensics.com/analysis.php?id=ffdd438724ace64b49b5eddb45a36b255c65d3cd.105386">http://fotoforensics.com/analysis.php?id=ffdd438724ace64b49b5eddb45a36b255c65d3cd.105386</a></p>

<p>Please note I&#39;m down for any and all opinions on this, I&#39;m not selling a definitive conclusion, just a truth seeker like yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can provide some insight on this image. I do a lot of photo analysis and work with photo editing software.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Some type of editing such as white balance adjustment, highlight adjustment, etc. will produce those &#39;contrasty&#39; snowy effects you see on the ELA (Error Level Analysis) conversions. If the entire image has been messed with in Lightroom, for example, it could show a lot of those showy areas all over the place. However, they would be somewhat uniform and very much alike on the entire image which indicates that the entire image has been saved an equal number of times and consistent throughout.</p></li>
<li><p>Images with little to no snowy effect indicate little to no editing with the white balance and/or copy paste and a low number of re-saves.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>What this means for the &#39;shooters&#39; image: The background was heavily edited for the white balance, highlights and possibly individual color gamma levels to match the white level of the actual person. That is why it is so snowy on the ELA image. The patches with flags have been pasted and then the layers were flattened. This was done quick. I am almost positive that whoever made this composite image wanted it to be discovered.</p>

<p>If I were to do it, I would spend an extra 30 minutes editing the &#39;shooter picture to carefully readjust individual gamma and white balance levels by increasing the &#39;Light&#39; setting in Photoshop/Lightroom, saving the image and then reducing that Light level using the exposure/white balance settings and then re-save the image again and again 3 to 4 times. It would make them look a lot more uniform on the ELA picture in the photo forensics. </p>

<p>EDIT: I am almost positive that the background picture started as a RAW image, then edited for lighting while the dude&#39;s picture was a JPEG. I could tell he is pasted with a naked eye without any s/w and bet my monthly paycheck on it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, let me walk you through it, <a href="/u/FrankTheShank1">/u/FrankTheShank1</a>. </p>

<p>The people posting here are white supremacists, as indicated by their post histories. The person who killed 9 people is also a white supremacist. The white supremacists here are desperately trying to insist that the shooter isn&#39;t one of them. Getting it yet? They&#39;re trying to wash their hands of the guy, because he did what they all dream of doing, and that might complicate their recruitment efforts here.</p>

<p>Why do white supremacists post here? To recruit. (They said so themselves.) Would anyone want to join them if they have an image of being a bunch of backwoods retard murderers? Probably not.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know from what angle you view reality, but I bet if a black family moved in next door into a house that they received through a government program and then proceeded to harass you first, then break into your home while you at work, beat, tie up and do other things to your wife and then threaten you to be &#39;knifed by his gangsta homies at 4am&#39; after you file a police report only to have the testimony revoked because you fear for your life. That is one of the things that had me looking at things differently. You see, this type of behavior is a cultural trend for some demographics and thats a fact!

<p>I don&#39;t know from what angle you view reality, but I bet if a black family moved in next door into a house that they received through a government program and then proceeded to harass you first, then break into your home while you at work, beat, tie up and do other things to your wife and then threaten you to be &#39;knifed by his gangsta homies at 4am&#39; after you file a police report only to have the testimony revoked because you fear for your life. That is one of the things that had me looking at things differently. You see, this type of behavior is a cultural trend for some demographics and thats a fact! I know that facts and statistics are the racist bunch of all, ain&#39;t it?</p>

<p>What the hell is stormfront?</p>

<p>Ah, thank you... it&#39;s nice when your type can be goaded into revealing their true nature. Thank you also for the elaborate fantasy of black people raping my family.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think I&#39;m being quite reasonable in suggesting that the motives of the people promoting this theory should be investigated, ideally by looking at their post history.</p>

<p>Say, <em>why is it</em> that all their post histories contain references to &quot;niggers,&quot; black people as subhuman animals incapable of thought, anti-semitic attitudes and Holocaust denial?</p>

<p>Why do <em>you</em> think this is happening?</p>

<p>Could it have something to do with the fact that the shooter is a white supremacist?</p>

<p>Say, why do YOU think all these white supremacists are here to assure us that no, the shooter certainly WASN&#39;T a white supremacist? When there&#39;s photographic evidence attesting to the fact that the shooter WAS INDEED a white supremacist, I mean? :&gt;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re right and they and the shooter are indeed white supremacists then I would guess the reason for the thread would be to deflect attention away from white supremacist groups by discrediting the photo. </p>

<p>On the other hand the main stream media has been pushing the black vs white narrative pretty heavily lately in what seems to be an effort to deepen racial divides, photo shopping the shooter would accomplish this motive.</p>

<p>I&#39;d also not consider it out of the realm of possibility that the posters in this thread may be white supremacists but also be correct about the photo shopping despite the aforementioned possible motive.</p>

<p>In the end all I care about is the truth, as of right now I am still on the fence but I&#39;ll keep an eye on the thread and form my own opinion after it has concluded. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You sound like a shill to me.  Plenty of white people have bad experiences living in the ghetto, get pissed off and then say stuff on reddit that they shouldn&#39;t.  Are they all white-supremacists?  Probably not, they may even have middle-class black friends and whatnot.   But here you think that there is some conspiracy of neo-Nazis invading r/conspiracy (more likely a conspiracy of shills to discredit r/conspiracy I would say).  I don&#39;t know if you are payed to be here or not, but you are jumping to conclusions.  Let&#39;s return to the original post, was it photoshopped or not?  His explanation certainly sounds convincing, do you have any evidence to the contrary or are you just assuming he is wrong because he is a bit (maybe a lot) racist?  Remember, he could be both racist and correct at the same time.  Stranger things have happened.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know, that example is their first step one and is designed to be as explicit as possible, it was probably photoshopped by someone who had very little idea what they are doing.</p>

<p>Suffice to say, the bright colors on the ELA reading of the shooter photo show different compression levels just around the patches. It&#39;s at the very least, sketchy. I&#39;ll try and find another tampered with picture that looks more similar to my example.</p>

<p>Edit: So, for example, you may find this interesting, what we&#39;re really looking for is differing levels of compression. So in this example, the entire logo displays that neon rainbow flair. This isn&#39;t sketchy because it&#39;s uniform and all over, this picture may have been compressed at some point in his history. However in the text you can see the latter half displays a differing level of compression, showing it has been altered. It&#39;s this differing level of compression that makes the initial analysis of the shooters photo sketchy, not necessarily the compression levels themselves.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The compression of those rectangle patches are not similar to other surfaces depicted in that photo because they are different than the other depicted surfaces.  While the mostly black patch seems similar, it is not because it has a dissimilar edge &amp; surface that are round.</p>

<p>Also, FotoForensics does not claim that bright colors like white, yellow, blue, etc.  are proof of modification.</p>

<p>From FotoForensics:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Error Level Analysis (ELA) quantifies the JPEG compression rate across the image. The compression rate for similar surfaces should look similar, and the rates for similar edges should look similar...</p>

<p>With ELA, &quot;white&quot; does not mean modified; white means a higher error level potential that must be compared against similar edges and similar surfaces in the picture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, the white, yellow, etc. are not markers of a modified image, it&#39;s the DIFFERENT compression levels that we have to look for. Like on this example:</p>

<p><a href="http://fotoforensics.com/analysis.php?challenge=1&amp;amp;id=05f1f54137a3681e2cfa55e01bf581fb2642c655.81540">http://fotoforensics.com/analysis.php?challenge=1&amp;amp;id=05f1f54137a3681e2cfa55e01bf581fb2642c655.81540</a></p>

<p>There is white, pink, etc. all over the image. Doesn&#39;t mean the whole thing was photoshopped. However the right hand side of the text exhibits levels of variation not found in the rest of the image, it therefore indicates that it was photoshopped. </p>

<p>I should add that this is an example from their site that is definitely photoshopped. So I agree, it&#39;s not the levels or the colors but the variance that indicates editing. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t say about your other point yet because I&#39;m still looking into it. Like I said I put this up as more of a discussion than a definitive conclusion so thanks for your input.</p>

<p>There is a drastic difference between the grain color and compression of the patches and the rest of the photo, whereas the face has absolutely no difference in compression grain compared to much darker, low saturated and absent of color areas like the jacket.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Basically his face, while slightly more saturated, is a big soft color. It doesn&#39;t have a lot of edges or high contrast. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure if you run enough of your own photos through the ECT tools on that site you&#39;ll find all sorts of surprising image artifacts. They are inherent in lossy compression.</p>

<p>Look into the way DCT compression works - essentially fine detail requires much more information to represent the visual information, which is why we see the differences in areas with more detail - it&#39;s why the background, with lots of detail in the trees, appears different to the foreground, with broader areas of color and less fine detail.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well, as a Black <em>woman</em>, i make every effort <em>every day</em> to let people know that i am not prejudiced against <em>anyone</em> whether based on race, religion, age, gender, in my conversation or by my actions,</p>

<p>funny you should ask, as i&#39;m considered &quot;odd&quot; because i can relate to people of different races/religions; it&#39;s only because my family knew people from other countries/cultures that came to our home. as a child i assumed everybody had the same experiences.</p>

<p>now i realize that not everybody has been lucky enough to have known/learned what i have. </p>

<p>while i have been bullied when i was younger &amp; yes, often people <em>still</em> think they can bully me now (just because some dumb asses make that assumption); they soon learn that i stand up for others AND myself, i&#39;m perceived as a quiet person but i can speak up for myself &amp; others when necessary, i may be small in stature -- but i don&#39;t take no shit (from NO BODY).</p>

<p>edit: i&#39;m very friendly :)  but i refuse to tolerate people that are mean or unnecessarily ignorant (of that makes sense)</p>

<p>This Dlyann Roff kid lived in South Carolina, that means he almost certainly went to school with Black kids and was not &quot;ignorant&quot; about Black people. This is not a matter of him never meeting Black people and only seeing racist stereotypes on TV.</p>

<p>He grew up surrounded by Black people and grew to hate them. So why is that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My question is. Who would take photos like this? It&#39;s so puzzling how some 20 year-old kid would go to the woods and take a picture of himself. Why wouldn&#39;t it be a selfie or webcam photo? </p>

<p>Someone obviously had to take the picture for him and if my friend/mom/cousin was taking a picture of me I wouldn&#39;t look that menacing at the camera. I mean he was demented. but its just strange</p>

<p>or he had a tripod set up. why someone would want to go to the woods just for a picture? obviously the answer seems easy. but its still strange that would be the only pic we have.</p>

<p>My family left right before Zimbabwe became extremist and hateful toward white people. Before they began driving out the white farmers. It&#39;s a shame they went that way, but I completely understand the attitude. What we did to them when we were in charge was simply inhuman. The anger was natural.</p>

The Zimbabwean white genocide was based on pure racial hatred and revenge upon those who had nothing to do with past oppression.

<p>While we&#39;ve been chatting, I&#39;ve been going through your post history. So far, I&#39;ve found dozens of posts, and even some threads posted by you, alleging that the Holocaust was a fabrication. I haven&#39;t found <em>a single one</em> where you mentioned being Jewish before our conversation took place. Maybe you could help me look? Maybe I missed them.</p>

<p>Personally, I don&#39;t think a Jewish person who has family that was affected by the Holocaust, would be working as intensely as you have, to deny the Holocaust ever happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean there&#39;s no way for me to prove it dude, but just so you know I am actually totally completely Jewish. I was raised into a reform synagogue on on Long Island, my grandparents were huge into the burgeoning zionist movement before the state of Israel became a thing (they met Netanyahu back in the day when he was in NYC), I was Bar Mitzvahed and learned a Haf Torah portion, could have done birthright but chose not to, I can read Hebrew but don&#39;t speak Hebrew (the case with a lot of people that were Bar / Bat Mitzvahed)... not really sure what else to tell you. I even learned about the holocaust, which you are professing that I deny, pretty much every single year in Hebrew school, where I also learned the classic aleph-bet song that, if any American Jew is reading this, will certainly know what I&#39;m talking about (Aleph bet vet, gimmel dallet hey, vav tzayin het tet...).</p>

<p>I just want you to know it&#39;s completely hilarious to me that you think that this is like, my back up when people call me out online, is to pretend to be Jewish. The irony of you calling me a stormfront skinhead is hilarious, my grandfather and his brother almost died fighting the Nazis. In fact one of them (brother, not my grandfather) volunteered to be in some of the first boats deploying at D-Day and rocked the shrapnel in his face until the day he died to prove it.</p>

<p>Maybe I could tell you about how the closest candidate for an ancestor to the Hebrew alphabet is Egyptian, and thus the Hebrew letters are strictly speaking hieroglyphic. This plays into the Qabalistic tree of life in really awesome ways, for example if you check it out, you&#39;ll see the path leading from the Sun (Tiphareth) in the center leading up to Kether (God, essentially) is Gimmel. Gimmel is a glyph of a camel (it even looks like a little camel). This is intentional as this path leading from the sun (which is the soul, beauty, life essentially) up to God (kether) crosses what we call the Abyss, it&#39;s like a journey, a journey you would make on a camel. There&#39;s 22 letters in the Hebrew alphabet, so there is one for each path on the tree of life, and each one has a cool graphic significance like this.</p>

<p>I hope you&#39;ll concede that while I could have googled that up (not really though...) it&#39;s strange that someone who is a white supremacist as you claim would have a working knowledge of Hebrew mysticism. It quite literally took me years to have a working understanding of the Qabalah and how it syncs up to other mystical systems, it&#39;s really not just something that I would take the time to learn if I was &quot;studying the enemy&quot; as you so claim.</p>

<p>I just hope you realize that you are literally, 100% proving the stereotype of people that come on here and assume anyone who has anything to say that is not trusting the official narrative of a story must be a nazi skinhead or something, especially because I am literally <strong>a Jew myself</strong>.</p>

<p>Anyway man I&#39;m done with you. I respect what you&#39;re trying to do but unfortunately you have incorrectly assumed who I am and what my motivations are. Many years ago I would have been just like you myself in fact. Lo siento, I am not the skinhead you are looking for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right. You&#39;re a Jew. Who doesn&#39;t believe the Holocaust happened, as evidenced by your post history. But you&#39;re protesting what I found in your post history, just now. Even though you&#39;ve been posting for ages about how the Holocaust didn&#39;t happen. Suddenly, just now, the Holocaust did happen. But it didn&#39;t as far as every post you&#39;ve made in the past.</p>

<p>Yep.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude I&#39;m just going to tell you this because I actually, really feel bad for you that you&#39;re so sure of yourself: someone investigating an aspect of history does not mean they don&#39;t think that event happened. If I were to check to see if the man on the street really had an accurate view of what happened at the Battle of Waterloo, that doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t think the War of 1812 never happened, or that Napoleon never existed. Likewise looking into my own misconceptions about the Holocaust does not mean that I think the Holocaust never happened or any other nonsense you&#39;ve been told to think.</p>

<p>I used to be JUST like you, thinking that anyone that was looking into the Holocaust was a total fucking lunatic, until I learned things like the fact that the gas chamber at Auschwitz is a reconstruction, and that in the 1990&#39;s historians quietly revised the death toll at Auschwitz from 4 million to 1 million. I also was never told about the worldwide Jewish boycott of German goods, things like LEHI (zionist terrorist group) attempting to collaborate with the Nazis, etc. (this is far from an outlandish posit and actually appears on their wikipedia page). Since these things form an integral part of <strong>my ethnic identity</strong> and <strong>my race</strong> and <strong>who I am in the most basic sense</strong> I naturally started to research them. It&#39;s indisputable that the Holocaust is the real catalyst to the modern Jewish identity so without understanding it, it&#39;s impossible for me to understand <strong>who I am</strong> or how to live in this modern world.</p>

<p>I just hope you realize that you&#39;re so conditioned to view people in these stereotypes that you have alarm bells ringing when someone&#39;s post history shows they&#39;ve been researching their own misconceptions about the Holocaust when in reality that would be <strong>the most natural thing in the world for an intelligent Jew to be doing.</strong></p>

<p>Anyway man like I said, I used to be just like you, so I thought I&#39;d give you a little window into what I&#39;m actually thinking and perhaps let you see things from my side of the aisle. I respect what you&#39;re trying to do, in a sense, so I just thought I&#39;d leave off this convo on a positive note and let you see through the veil into the reality of the situation, that I&#39;m actually just a Jewish kid sitting up in a messy apartment in NYC trying to figure out how the world ended up in the state it&#39;s in, and what my place in it is.</p>

<p>Anyway it&#39;s been fun man but let&#39;s part ways. Good luck on your quest, it is a strange journey indeed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah, the category I fall into is Polish. You know, that other half of the Holocaust that was being wiped out by the Nazis alongside your people. We lost a fifth of our population to the Nazis, which admittedly isn&#39;t as major as the approximate 50% of all Jews wiped from existence by the Nazis as far as demographics go, but I think you understand now why I find anyone who even slightly stinks of Holocaust denial to be utterly repulsive.</p>

<p>Frankly, I believe the body count of the Holocaust is vastly understated. I think far more died than the official records account for. How do you feel about that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, that&#39;s hard to say.</p>

<p>I think that far more died than the SOVIET records account for (like...far, far more) but I&#39;m clearly mixed up with a few things--like how World Jewry could go UP (unless the almanacs are wrong, which is a possibility) during the War Years. Personally I think that this is a Stormfront-style lie but I haven&#39;t looked into it anywhere near as well as I should have.</p>

<p>One thing that I DO hate is people blatantly profiting off of the suffering of my forefathers. Certain filmmakers come to mind. </p>

<p>Holocaust &quot;denial&quot; is a weird thing. People that &quot;deny&quot; that it happened are scumbags. People that question the numbers...well, I can see their point. I think that what they forget is that, during wartime, the <em>basic human necessities</em> are breaking down and faltering--accurate record-keeping simply falls by the wayside.</p>

<p>I saw this with my own eyes in Bosnia working for a relief organization in 1996.</p>

<p>Anyhow, l&#39;chaim my friend! I&#39;m all for your error-level work...this is the stuff that brings the TRUTH out...unfortunately Reddit is not the place to go for TRUTH anymore...and hasn&#39;t been for a long time. Pity.</p>

<p>Now there&#39;s a term I hear Jews using all the time. (Oh wait, no, I hear anti-semitic skinheads using it all the time.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The man overheard a conversation spoken in Hebrew, which drew his attention. He hid behind an 8-foot tall retaining wall and listened in to their conversation as they stood below. Shortly after a Lincoln town car approached the two people and the man in the backseat got out to greet them. After normal niceties were exchanged the third man said: “The Americans will learn what it is to live with terrorists after the planes hit the twins in September.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From your post history - an insinuation that 9/11 was done by the Jews. Man, what is it with all these people posting here, alleging to be Jewish, then participating in anti-semitic conversations left and right?</p>

<p>Is this a new Stormfront thing? Pretend to be Jewish to silence anyone who might question your anti-Jewish propaganda?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uuuh, I&#39;m not pretending to be anything that I&#39;m not.</p>

<p>Furthermore--to suggest that I think that 9/11 was done &quot;by the Jews&quot; is hilarious. Utterly shameful.</p>

<p>Were Jewish people a HUGE part of what took place that day? I believe so. Was Mossad instrumental in planning and carrying out the &quot;attacks?&quot; Without a doubt.</p>

<p>But to suggest that ANY ethnic group &quot;ran&quot; 9/11 besides who really did--PNAC assholes bent on total World domination (and yes, that group was/is disproportionately Jewish without a doubt) is just plain ludicrous.</p>

<p>You think/believe what you&#39;d like about me. I am Jewish...but I also strive to find the TRUTH in the chaos that swirls all around our heads. Sadly, more and more these days that &quot;truth&quot; (when it&#39;s bad news) has had Jews behind it in one form or another...most of them Zionist Likudnik terrorists. My biggest fear is that people will associate ME with &quot;that type.&quot; And guess what? Now that more and more people are learning the <em>real</em> truth behind 9/11 (including the names) I have been faced with the first incident of &quot;anti-semitism&quot; (last year) in my entire life. And it all had to do with 9/11 and what &quot;our people&quot; did that day. Is this the impression that you want people to have about Jews? Because, I hate to tell you, that&#39;s what&#39;s happening. The Muslims and Christians are getting wise to the fact that <em>someone</em> wants them to slaughter each other--despite their very similar belief system (in a generalized sense of course).</p>

<p>Israel IS a terror state. Israel IS an apartheid state. These are true statements--as true as &quot;the electron is too small to be seen with the naked eye.&quot; The only &quot;true Jews&quot; that will get up and acknowledge this fact nowadays is the Neturei Karta. And that&#39;s just sad. They are very brave men--but, also, they&#39;ve nothing to lose. They&#39;ve adhered to Torah Judaism--NOT Talmudic Judaism.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all ok though--we are watching karma unfold right before our very eyes as Israel, basically, commits suicide. </p>

<p>Our people have been expelled from, what is it, <strong>109 countries?</strong></p>

<p>My long-departed grandfather had an old Yiddish proverb he used much too often--but it certainly said it best. Roughly translated, it said &quot;If one person calls you a horse, ignore them. If two people call you a horse, call them both donkeys. But if <em>three</em> people call you a horse...well then grandson, you&#39;d better get fitted for a saddle and a feedbag!&quot;</p>
