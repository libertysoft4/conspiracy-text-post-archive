    <div class="md"><p>I personally believe this is how it went down, it seems to make sense to me. I believe explosives would have been far too obvious and a lot more messy. People did report hearing pops all around in initial interviews and I guess that could have been some form of detention caps used to ignite the thermite if it was used. </p>

<p>I did see something where a woman gathered up dust samples to inspect when it happened, seems a bit of a strange thing to do straight after and during the event but I guess if she worked in that field then it might have held interest to her and she might have been thinking ahead for whatever reason. The samples where said to contain small spherical metalic pieces consistent with by product from thermite. Thermite consists of iron and aluminium and I can&#39;t see the world trade centres holding any iron of quantity, so it does make it difficult to explain away. </p>

<p>The fact that ground zero was said to be giving off serious heat for a couple of weeks afterwards might give indication of something like that too. I have seen no one giving any arguments against the possiblity, but at the same time as much as I believe in it I haven&#39;t seen any hard evidence to back it up, if there is any I haven&#39;t seen it out there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you dont believe in it, and it&#39;s believers are delusional/schizophrenic or what ever mental illness you, or just the public in general, like to place on 9/11 truthers, then why do you spend so much time trying to convince otherwise? Why do you care so much? Why not let them believe in it? Do you believe in God? If not, do you harass Christian subs? You see where im going with this? Why cant you let people believe what they want? Is it hurting you that over 50% of Americans now do <em>not</em> believe the official narrative of 9/11? Is over half of America schizophrenic or delusional? </p>

<p>You&#39;ve still yet to answer me when I&#39;ve asked what conspiracies you believe in. You say &quot;us&quot; and call yourself a conspiracy theorist. You should have no problem telling me which conspiracies you subscribe to.</p>

<p>Im just trying to figure you out bruh. Everything inside me tells me you&#39;re a government paid troll. Which also leads me to believe you wont answer this question thoroughly. Or you&#39;ll say you dont feel like explaining yourself. </p>

<p>I see you denying nanothermite, and I&#39;ve seen you support the office fires collapsing WTC7. Can you debunk the missing $2 trill, the Pentagon, Pennsylvania, the unscathed passport (hahahaa you gotta be literally stupid to believe that one), the dead/missing ground zero witnesses. Can you seriously tell me those witnesses not being able to testify is just a coincidence? If so, you are gullible as fuck and put too much faith in the very people that enslave you. Can you debunk the foreshadowing of 9/11 in movies, WCW/WWF, music? Osama bin Laden&#39;s death? The training exercises that day? Dude I could go on and on. Debunk. Lets go. </p>
