Take away the guns and people will still harm each other, knives, scissors, landscaping tools, 2x4 with a nail through it, anything can be a weapon. Just like the first class on an airplane can have metal utensils, while us peasants, can&#39;t carry a nail clipper or leatherman. The law enforcement and military can have firepower but not the people? Firearms HAVE been created already and it&#39;s too late now, better for all sides to have em then just a privileged few, which would instantly give them power over the rest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s why I used the word <em>institutionalized</em>; Americans are socially engineered toward racism and violence, whereas the British are socially engineered toward passivity. There are always exceptions, of course; not everyone is so easily influenced, but the people behind it deal in trends concerning millions of people, and centuries of time. Firearms are not the problem, and murder is usually just a symptom of what actually is.</p>

.I think your best chance of neither is mandating a living minimum wage, a negative income tax, and creating economic growth by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, and shifting from unsustainable factory farming to a regenerative agroecology.</p>

<p>Good luck avoiding either if you&#39;re volunteering to line up outside the residences of holdout gun owners after the ban to collect their firearms from their cold dead fingers.</p>

<p>For every person advocating a gun ban, I imagine a person dressed up in full riot gear lined up outside ready to die. If only you had such integrity. Instead I&#39;m sure you&#39;d send young, poor men and women to do the dirty work for you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I don&#39;t think we&#39;d do that kind of forced confiscation.  If we banned guns, lots of law-abiding people would turn in their guns.  Manufacturing and sales would stop.  As criminals were arrested, guns seized from them would be destroyed.  Criminals would find it harder to get guns as the supply of guns to steal dried up.  Ex-wives and such would rat out gun owners.  As gun owners died, sometimes their inheritors would turn in the guns instead of keeping them.  It would take decades, maybe a century, but eventually we&#39;d get 95-99% of the guns out of society.</p>

They needed oil and other resources.</p>

<p>Yes, when a country has major problems such as war or a nutty dictator, results are going to be bad even if the gun laws are good.</p>

<p>Taking guns away reduces my chances of being murdered.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, true. But if you&#39;re going on a killing rampage, you&#39;d have to train so regularly that cleaning guns would be necessary. Ask any regular shooter, accuracy is a learned skill. That&#39;s one of the most odd elements of many of these mass shootings the media perpetuates: many of the shooters shouldn&#39;t have had the skills necessary to achieve the results they did.</p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;m wrong about that point though. Maybe 1st person shooters really do help. </p>

<p>I only vaguely recall some of these shooters having only gone out and bought guns shortly before the shooting (I think Virginia tech) or having been denied access to gun ranges(pretty sure that was the Aurora theatre.) </p>

<p>I think so. Supposedly the Aurora gunman was firing 50 rounds per minute into a packed theatre. I don&#39;t think he had a fully auto gun though and many reports alleged a second gunman.</p>

<p>Social decay causes all violence. If you want to end the violence, start by mandating living wages, instituting negative income taxes, and funding the replacement of vastly outdated civil services like roads and sewers with maglev trains and composting programs.</p>

<p>No. We don&#39;t.</p>

<p>For the record, I love gays, drugs, and non-white people. The social decay I&#39;m speaking of is poverty, hunger, and oppressive justice systems like the one in the USA that favors corporations over people, steals children from families, incarcerates individuals for victimless crime, persecutes people for self-medication, and otherwise sucks donkey Kong dick big time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No.</p>

<p>Look at Mexico vs. America- murders per million people:</p>

<p>Mexico- 24 firearm mpmp and 218 mpmp total</p>

<p>USA- 33 firearm mpmp and 42 mp total</p>

<p>While 3/4 of murders in the USA are gun related and only 1/10 of murders in Mexico are gun related, Mexico still has 5x the murders of the USA despite the US having 6x the guns.</p>

<p>Guns are tools. They can save lives or end them. Banning them does absolutely nothing to address the real causes of the violence.</p>

<p>Address the real causes. Quit blaming inanimate objects for injustices perpetrated by sentient citizens.</p>

<p>Similarly, getting into a fist-fight is also potentially deadly, but it tends not to be. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is your proposed solution ?  I really want to hear other solutions from the pro-gun people.  I&#39;ve heard:</p>

<p>1- arm everyone</p>

<p>2- arm teachers / fortify schools</p>

<p>3- lock up all the crazy people</p>

<p>4- tighten the gun-control laws</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think any of those will work, so I go with:</p>

<p>5- ban private ownership of guns of all types, maybe except shotguns for home defense, if a total ban is not possible</p>

<p>Why each solution above won&#39;t work:</p>

<p>1- arm everyone: will greatly increase accidents, mistakes, suicides, stolen guns; will turn country into armed camps and fortifications everywhere; high cost.  No other country has found it necessary to do this to keep its citizens from killing each other.</p>

<p>2- arm teachers / fortify schools: we&#39;ve had shootings in schools, movie theaters, offices, post offices, stores, fast-food places, churches; going to arm workers in all of them ?</p>

<p>3- lock up all the crazy people: we&#39;re not willing to pay for it; people&#39;s brains are very difficult to analyze and control; going to lock up all the near-crazy, drunks, druggies, anger cases, road-ragers, loser teenagers who MIGHT go over the edge ? Other countries have plenty of crazy people, but don&#39;t have the slaughter we have.</p>

<p>4- tighten laws: okay, do it, but it won&#39;t stop the slaughter; I think the guns at Columbine and Newtown and Charleston, for example, were owned completely legally.  Some 600,000 guns are stolen each year in USA.</p>

<p>5- ban guns: would work, but not politically possible at this time.</p>

<p>Any other solutions ?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fuck I must be a broken record:</p>

<p>Fix society!</p>

<p>Mandatory living wages or a negative income tax would seriously reduce poverty. Poverty is the mother of crime. Raise employment levels with projects that rebuild/replace our crumbling and archaic infrastructures with modern, sustainable systems.</p>

<p>And for ducks sake fix our agricultural system. Factory monocultures of annuals are killing the planet&#39;s ecosystems while failing to feed our species.</p>

<p>You want to know my solution? Feed the poor goddamnit. It&#39;s not just me claiming there is a positive correlation between hunger and violence. There&#39;s entire books written on it.</p>

<p>All your options are completely nutters and ignore the root causes of the problems. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Guns don&#39;t feed people. Yes, hunting, I know. But seriously, all info indicates farming/foraging has provided in the bulk of calories in humanity&#39;s diet for millennia.</p></li>
<li><p>These shooting do have a habit of occurring in gun free zones... Almost as if the shooters had signs directing them to defenseless targets... Still doesn&#39;t feed anyone though.</p></li>
<li><p>You&#39;re joking. Look how well this strategy has worked for drug users. The war on guns is less stupid than the war on drugs... I&#39;ll give you that. However neither of them hits at the poverty and hunger that causes the destructive behaviors we&#39;re trying to stop. For profit prisons are modern day slavery. Fuckign disgusting and won&#39;t solve the problem. Will only create thousands more.</p></li>
<li><p>Still not addressing the causes of the violence. I might agree with gun licensing that accompanies a training program would cut back on accidents. But without addressing the poverty/hunger issue, it won&#39;t do any good against the intentional violence.</p></li>
<li><p>Guns don&#39;t kill people. Hungry, poor, angry people kill people. Usually the people they blame for their poverty, hunger, and anger.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Or my solution</p>

<ol>
<li>Bring the poor out of poverty and feed everybody. I promise violent crime rates will plummet in a world with less to get angry about. </li>
</ol>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, we should try to fix society.  We try to do that constantly.  But it sort of is impossible.  We&#39;re always going to have the crazy, and near-crazy, and fighting drunks, and druggies, and road-ragers, and wacky teenagers, and anger-management problems, and criminals, loose on our streets. Sure, we should try to identify and treat or limit them.  But why have society flooded with guns so these people can cause maximum damage ?</p>

<p>And other comparable countries have all of those societal ills (mental illness, drugs, violence, crime, poverty, etc), yet don&#39;t have the slaughter USA does.</p>

<p>Those first 4 solutions are things proposed by gun-guys, not by me.  I agree with you that they&#39;re nonsense.</p>

<p>On #5: sure, guns BY THEMSELVES don&#39;t kill people.  But they make it really easy for people to kill people.  And countries with far fewer guns have far lower homicide rates than we do.</p>

<p>Why can&#39;t we fight poverty AND get rid of guns ?  Doesn&#39;t have to be one or the other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The UK has twice the rate of robbery, three times the rate of rape, 35% more car theft, 327x the drug offenses, and five times the imbezzlement of American counterparts.</p>

<p>Explain why Norway has 1/10th the homicide rate of the US despite having the tenth highest gun ownership rate?</p>

<p>Better yet, explain why Serbia has 1/39th the rape as America despite being 2nd in gun ownership?</p>

<p>Even better yet, explain why Mexico has the 13x the murder rate of Serbia?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Google &quot;a gun behind every blade of grass.&quot;</p>

<p>Japan didn&#39;t invade the mainland because they were afraid of our armed populace. Other countries have done terribly despite banning or restricting gun ownership. Look at Mexico and Venezuala. </p>

<p>We already have a tyrannical government. Taking guns away from responsible citizens doesn&#39;t protect you.</p>
