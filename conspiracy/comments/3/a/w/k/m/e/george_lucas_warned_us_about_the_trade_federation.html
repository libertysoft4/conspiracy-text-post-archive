    <div class="md"><p>ZetaTalk explains that it was no coincidence that George Lucas wrote Star Wars, released the trilogies when he did, etc...</p>

<p><strong>ZetaTalk:</strong> <em>&quot;Star Wars, Today&quot;</em> (written May 21, 2005)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&amp;nbsp; We have mentioned that an increasing polarization of those aligning themselves spiritually with caring for others, those in the Service-to-Other, and those aligning themselves with self-interest, those in the Service-to-Self, would emerge as the pole shift approached. This was predictable, and has been heavily emphasized in some prophecies such as those in the Bible, as an indication that the End Times had arrived. Why would this be? In the battle for converts, those in the Service-to-Self lose out, the vast majority of emerging souls, some 95% on average, choosing the path of empathy. When a world such as the Earth, that has served as a schoolhouse for emerging souls, is about to transform into a world for those who have chosen empathy, a last-ditch effort by those seeking converts for the self-serving occurs. Why hold back, to posture for future decades, when time is running out. Go for the prize. Turn the screw of fear and hopelessness. Make the rewards for marauding and lying extreme, the better to encourage converts. Caution is thrown to the wind, during such times, and the raw hand of greed emerges from the glove of political correctness. The truth is revealed, and those creating problems behind the scenes in the past exposed for what they are.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp; This Star Wars episode, the point where democracy crumbles before the supposed necessity of defending against endless attacks, is the darkest hour, a hero turning to the Dark Side, the hand of evil at the helm of the congress applauded as more and more military action is announced. Yet this hand of evil is revealed as the very cause of the disturbances, from the start. How similar to the Bush Administration, which is accused of being cognizant of 911 before it occurred, and which has taken full advantage of the powers granted to it to invade oil-producing countries long in their sights. Do such things happen on other 3rd Density worlds, where the battle between good and evil is the central issue? Even on worlds where the intelligent life form is a fish, such polarization occurs, as all life forms have alternative actions that can be taken, to help those around them, or to further themselves, solely. On a water world, the issue may be blocking access to lush feeding areas, unless cooperation with such militant blocking action is allowed, the strong victimizing the weak. Where the Earth has OIL as its predictable energy source, this allowed predictability in the wars in the Middle East, where vast and readily accessible oil resources reside. Thus, the emphasis in prophecy that the Middle East would be at the center of End Times wars.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp; The timing of this release, where the Star Wars trilogies were presented with the middle trilogy first, then the first trilogy, and finally the last potentially being released, is hardly by accident. Where the entire Star Wars series was written decades ago, the movie releases were timed by Lucas, who is not ignorant of the times or their meaning. He chose the sequence and the timing, and chose well. Consider the masses, quite used to greed and political power mongering, going into the Transformation period mostly unaware of the significance of the times. America, holding the strongest military power in the world, is viciously and quite obviously attacked on 911, with a predictable reaction. The public would presume, at first, a just cause, but given the late arrival of the End Times maneuvers, may not have time to understand the outcome. Thus, many decades ago, the first releases on film of the Star Wars trilogies were those where the good guys won, though far outnumbered, requiring only courage and conviction to win. With this settled firmly into the public mind, the first trilogy was then released, showing how democracy crumbled, a point which might have been lost if released decades ago. That these films were released only recently is not by accident, as they were timed to coincide with preparation for the End Times maneuvers over the oil fields, so much apparent at the moment. Thus the viewer is assured of the ultimate result, the good guys winning, while dealing, in reality, with those darkest moments on Earth.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp; As we have mentioned, many authors and producers are aware of the alien presence, the approaching pole shift, and the expected polarization in spiritual orientations that occurs going into a Transformation. That Lucas should be among them should not be a surprise. </p>

<p>Well, spoiler for anyone who isn&#39;t familiar with Star Wars....I guess....</p>

<p>The villain is actually a cunningly devious, evil politician who is hell-bent on sole authority. </p>

<p>I think Palpatine just used the Trade Federation the whole time. They were basically just a war chest. Once he had everything he wanted, he disposed of them immediately. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lucas wrote the first draft of Star Wars before the Fall of Saigon as an anti-Vietnam War movie. The tiny &quot;Journal of the Whills&quot; preface to the Star Wars novelization (also supposedly written in 1973) <a href="http://www.killermovies.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-305625-the-journal-of-the-whills.html">http://www.killermovies.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-305625-the-journal-of-the-whills.html</a> is evidence he had planned from that early date for the prequels to be about corruption of government. We can speculate that in addition to the Vietnam War that he drew inspiration from the JFK assassination, LBJ, and Nixon.</p>

<p>For those of us who were awake in 2002, Episode II was a refreshing expose on the Hegelian Dialectic, having been released just 8 months after 9/11. This was too soon for Lucas to have written it with 9/11 in mind; rather, he simply understood from his 1960s/1970s life experiences how government worked. When Episode III came out in 2005, even the mass media could not ignore the small bit of wakefulness in the public regarding the folly of the Iraq War and quoted people saying, &quot;Hey, this movie is about Bush and the Iraq War, isn&#39;t it?&quot; No, it wasn&#39;t. It was about the Vietnam War, a war with many similarities to the Iraq War. George Lucas couldn&#39;t help that he had pegged government and that government repeats its tricks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the new star wars movie &quot;the force awakens&quot;, is eluding to a mass awakening of consciousness. 
More people, not even &quot;conspiracy minded&quot; individuals are noticing how fucked up the US is. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s common knowledge around here that movies, especially big movies where a lot of people are expected to view, contain messages and images that represent what is to come. </p>

<p>Kinda like how before 9/11 a lot of shows in media were showing a 9/11 situation, whether through the numbers, or through the actual event. </p>

<p>Pre predictive programing is what it is called, if I recall correctly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are correct. I&#39;ve heard it as &quot;predictive programming&quot; but Iam sure there are multiple names and ways to apply the idea. </p>

<p>One example that sticks out in my mind is in &#39;WW Z&#39; where in the part when they&#39;ve been evacuated to the ship, in the background you see soldiers carrying off the constitution of the USA, presumably to lock it away for &quot;safe keeping&quot;. </p>

<p>It could be , or I could just be overthinking it. But I&#39;ve always believed most movies to be previews of things to come. Where else to hide the truth, but right out in plain sight. </p>

<p>TPTB love to hide things in plain site. There is a lot of info on how they do this. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it is farfetched at all to belive that if a major catastrophic event was to occur in the states, the Constitution wouldn&#39;t be in affect. </p>
