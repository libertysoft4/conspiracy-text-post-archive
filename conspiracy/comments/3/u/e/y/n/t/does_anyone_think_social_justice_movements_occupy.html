        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="http://wnd.com/2014/04/bill-gates-soros-profit-from-jailing-illegals/">George Sorros is a shareholder of the GEO group, which operates 48 private prisons in the US.</a> and I don&#39;t doubt he has ties through subsidiary to other prison groups, given how profitable they are and to their shareholders. </p>

<p>Given he&#39;s invested $30M into the Black Lives Matter movement, I can&#39;t help but feel it&#39;s a method to disrupt the organization and tarnish public perception against a group that formed with the desire to fix legitimate social problems with police profiling and brutality which leads to a disproportionate amount of PoC being put into prison for non violent offenses like drugs and traffic violations.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/dec/29/fbi-coordinated-crackdown-occupy">It was the same with Occupy Wall Street, with the FBI, DHS and campus police infiltrating them in cooperation with Banks and the New York stock exchange</a>, disorganizing leadership and cohesive views while the media was complicit in finding the worst representation of the movement to display on the news network. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a little obvious that the powers that be operate with government agencies to quell social movements (Pinkertons anyone?) but the recent bad coverage of Black Lives Matter make me think the energy of wanting change is being funneled back towards the group to cripple them against public opinion. </p>

<p>Any articles you might want to share regarding the subject?</p>

<p>I didnt know that about George Soros, but I knew something was fucked with BLM when they rudely disrupted a Bernie rally to grab the podium and basically scream in his face. Bernie refused to talk to them and left the rally. </p>

Enraging pair, esp. considering Bernies work in the civil rights era and the present for poor minorities...</p>

<p>I have been to a couple of those Eric garner type protests (even got on local news, buddy got interviewed) and I always felt very comfortable at those. The atmosphere was less furious and more aimed at providing a sense of solidarity or community? The poor blacks there were more sociable then what I see the media is portraying it to be. Alot of music.</p>

<p><em>Let&#39;s tell the truth here.  BLM is being torn apart by government operatives committing false flag atrocities - divide and conquer, by any means necessary.</em></p>

<p>Evil immoral secret police bastards.  It should be an ironclad law that no police officer or government agent with police authority ever appear out of uniform in public.</p>

<p>There has never been a secret police agency in history that was successfully dismantled - since they have no accountability and unlimited funding, they just basically core democracy like evil parasitic monsters, and destroy anyone who threatens their corporate masters and the corrupt government who rules on their behalf.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t make this shit up - it is almost too ugly and evil to comprehend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Occupy wall street was the last great chance we had at voicing our thoughts openly. It unified us into a force, and, at least for a brief while, things were looking brighter and more hopeful than they had in years. People were shouting the truth and it was spreading across the net and the world like wildfire. At the time, I actually started to believe that we may have had a shot at addressing real issues and finally learning to put things right. But before long, the media mocking began. The hammer was brought down. eventually, even the underground (this place was underground back then) areas of the net began down talking the occupy Movement. It became a joke, a meme for an aimless generation. And by the time it was through fizzling out, the proper adjustments were made and it was practically guaranteed that a similar uprising wouldn&#39;t happen again. I was there. I saw it, and believe me, it was a breath of fresh air to see how many of us there actually are. We are more than I ever knew. </p>

<p>OWS was the handout queen, media promoted, crybully counter-revolutionary movement advertised to funnel rebel souls away from the true dissidents of the era (primarily Voluntaryists who pose one of the only genuine threats to the established order) who were at that time diffusing-out into population post-RP08.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is absolutely true, although it being done more likely by planted FBI and Law Enforcement personnel.</p>

<p>For example - for the last 30 years the American Civil Liberties Union has bounced from fringe issue to fringe issue, destroying their reputation and constantly fighting for unpopular, who-gives-a-shit issues.</p>

<p>I could care less if the ten commandments are carved on every courthouse wall - the real issue is that we are denied the fair trial by jury in a system that &#39;plea bargains&#39; people into the for profit industry of human misery that is American &#39;justice&#39;.</p>

<p>Real issues go unchallenged, and the entire structure of the ACLU is polluted with people who without a doubt draw two paychecks - and the big paycheck is from the government to allow our unbelievably cruel and unconstitutional government to go unchallenged.</p>

<p>Same thing has been done to the Unions for even longer.  When you have no qualms about lying, stealing and killing to suppress legitimate dissent and human rights, you kind of win every time.  They cheat.  Their own documents decades later prove it when they come to light, every day new evidence comes in that they are still doing it, yet the average American waves the flag and walks blindly through life.</p>

<p>It is a f*cking shame.</p>

<p>What a load of crap.  Soros is a deliberate distraction, his money buying his way into a growing and legitimate popular movement.  You don&#39;t BECOME a billionaire unless you have a corrupt help from government and industry power brokers.  Oh sure, once in a while a true visionary sneaks through, like Elon Musk, Gates or Jobs, but it has been pretty obvious for generations that to make real money you have to get unlimited access to the public trough.</p>

<p>From screaming campus protestors to firebombs in the street, BLM is being torn apart by police and agency operatives who flooded into the movement with deep pockets and secret, evil agenda.</p>

<p>By dominating the cash stream, these informants, moles and agents quickly move into key positions and begin populating the protests with agents who spread violence, marginalize and eventually neuter or destroy the popular uprising.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you knew anything you would know that google, wiki, yahoo are all libertarian directed to keep everyone as misinformed as possible.  </p>

<p>And where is actual evidence, not propaganda that Soros is financially supporting BLM?  What address would anyone send a contribution to? etc. How would anyone find a list of their financial support? </p>
