        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Not too long ago I found my personal beliefs in regards to state secrecy needing to be abolished, and the operations of this sub to be in minor conflict. </p>

<p>Where the utility of moderator transparency was achievable thanks to software developed by goldf1sh, I felt like we absolutely should implement that software here.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/37hglt/vote_inside_on_public_access_to_rconspiracy/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/37hglt/vote_inside_on_public_access_to_rconspiracy/</a></p>

<p>I have a similar proposition for you all now that I would like to call the jubilee.</p>

<p>Firstly allow me to preface my motives, intention and frustration behind this idea.</p>

<p>My motive is to let some pressure off before it builds up and explodes, my intention is that you will ALL see why our rules are shaped the way they are because of my frustration that some of us would prefer anarchy over order when it involves how this subreddit functions.</p>

<p>While I fully support our set of rules and understand the need for each of them, what I propose is a day each month of jubilee.  Maybe something like the first and last day of each month... fall where they may, that our rules which don&#39;t require a change to automods config (Facebook links and account age) be suspended from 0001 on the last day of each month until 2359 on the first day of the following month.</p>

<p>This would be a rule free 48 hours that straddles the last and first day of each month.  A jubilee of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>I expect that such an arrangement would be a festival of nonsense, but I would be dishonest if I didn&#39;t acknowledge that many users here whom I know to be regular loyal users desire such an opportunity to vent and post memes or call people shills etc etc etc.</p>

<p>This thread is purposed by me alone to guage community interest in a jubilee. None of this has been set in stone or even discussed by the mod team, this idea is in its infancy.  I value your thoughts and opinions, your feedback is important here.</p>

<p>Kind regards,</p>

<p>Flytape</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I&#39;d be more interested in is transparency on just the top few threads. They seem to be hit the hardest.</p>

<p>I go into the thread and top comment is a glorious embodiment of <a href="/r/conspiracies">/r/conspiracies</a> sentiments boiled down in a well phrased, meaningful expression.</p>

<p>And then I come back a few minutes later, and the top post is utterly contrary to 99.99% of anything in this sub with a hundred up votes.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think our rules or tools address this issue. It&#39;s not the case for most threads, but the ones that start to get notice, especially in regards to certain topics.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t but assume that brigading is happening. </p>

<p>If this sub brings to light a topic, then others should feel welcome to join in. But sticking a plausible deniability post right at the top of the thread devalues any attention that the thread generates. </p>

<p>Perhaps, we could make a feature or a heading of plausible deniability and condemn such posts to there?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Any system can be exploited. Any time you give someone a judgment call you open the door for abuse.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been on discussion forums (in one form or another) for a couple decades now, and there&#39;s no forum I&#39;ve seen that has survived a dedicated sustained attack. It doesn&#39;t matter what rules you create: there&#39;s an empire dominating this world and it suppresses the truth wherever it can.</p>

<p>I&#39;m only here because of the size of the audience, but it&#39;s basically pointless nowadays. Reddit&#39;s algorithm requires 10 total points on a post within an hour to leave the new queue, and that just doesn&#39;t ever happen for any truth that&#39;s actually controversial.</p>

<p>These guys are bent out of shape because I don&#39;t subscribe to their particular 911 theory.  I get it!

<p>In a perfect world ALL 911 theories should be discussed here without people coming under assault for not signing up for the dominant one.</p>

<p>The one particular org that im talking about has created a toxic culture where they shun and attack people for discussing other 911 theories. This is fine and dandy within their own forum, that&#39;s their business there.  But within this forum it creates conflict that doesn&#39;t belong here.</p>
