    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the unspoken postscript to the stages of genocide for the perpetrators to deny it happened, like Britain did to the Kenyans. This diabolical gaslight can restart the genocidal stages (Khymer Rouge used this and other tactics to prolong killing campaigns and start new ones). Guarding against denial is a great way to steel people against future genocides and show bare minimum respect to victims and survivors.</p>

<p>That there is a conspiracy to exagerrate or fabricate Nazi acts of genocide is interesting, but total bullshit. I&#39;ve met survivors and had acquaintances with descendants of victims. Even if you postulate that all of the copious physical evidence was created solely for a psyop, can you possibly imagine telling a survivor, &quot;Oh, you made this all up.&quot; If you can do that, you&#39;re scum and have no place in a civil world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are 16 nations that have made denial of either specifically the Jewish or any holocaust illegal or have formally labeled it hate speech, all but Israel and Australia in Europe.  Not counting Israel, Germany and Austria the other 13 are split 6 where denying any holocaust or major crime against humanity is illegal and 7 where only the Jewish holocaust is illegal.  5 of the 13 were never under Nazi control and Spain was a sixth until 2007.</p>

<p>Your simple explanation doesn&#39;t hold up so well under scrutiny.</p>

<p>Holocaust denial is stupid but these laws ban true freedom of expression (i.e. the right to be wrong/an idiot/an asshole etc.) while simultaneously lending an air of credibility to the claims (&quot;If it really happened, why would they try to silence us?&quot;).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it really doesn&#39;t it&#39;s an simple and logical reaction, to an pretty fucked up feat of humanity, what else should&#39;ve been in the aftermath?
But you should know, the holocaust also destroyed more then just jewish folks, homosexuals, handicapped, gypsies, political opponents.
If you know the slightest thing of the european countries you listed is that the act is more of showing the reality and remorse of had happened not on infringing personal speech which does happen by a select few, bibi for example.
In these countries in their respective education systems the second world war is actually taught in detail instead of just sucking the U.S freedom boner.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Being an Army brat and having spent 4 years living in Germany, I believe I can answer WHY this is.  You see, there was this old German lady who lived down the street from me.  She had cats, and my folks would not let me have any pets.  So I hung out with this old lady and her cats.  Because....cats =).  She spoke really good English (American TV is a thing over there) and we talked a lot about how Germany used to be.  I asked her about Hitler and how the German people could let someone like that come into power.  She told me that Hitler was not bad in the beginning.  People liked him, people thought he would bring Germany new hope after a horrible depression.  But then the government started shutting everyone out - secret courts, secret police, secret laws....ect.  Before they knew it, they were surrounded by a shit-storm and could see no way out.  The insidiousness was slow, and it crept up on the German people in the name of patriotism.  THAT is why it is illegal to deny the Holocaust.  NOT because it is better/worse than any other atrocity.  But because it happened so EASILY....because NO ONE SAW IT COMING.  They keep the past close so it won&#39;t be repeated.  </p>

<p>this paints a dark picture</p>

<p>but explain to us why denying the Holocaust get you jailed but denying other human massacres is ok?</p>

<p>Furthermore </p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/21/middleeast/netanyahu-hitler-grand-mufti-holocaust/">http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/21/middleeast/netanyahu-hitler-grand-mufti-holocaust/</a></p>

<p>Netanyahu claims Hitler didn&#39;t even want to kill the Jews until a Muslim told him too...</p>

<p>So will Germany Jail Netanyahu or just average Joes?</p>

<p>Because it seems like these laws are for one set of people but not for another</p>

<p>That is why it is illegal to deny the Holocaust in Germany....because it happened...in GERMANY! </p>
</blockquote>

<p>But jailing someone just because they question the official state &quot;story&quot; of what the holocaust was just seems absurd and over authoritarian.</p>

<p>and for what?</p>

<p>just because you want to challenge the historical narrative (which always gets written by the victors)</p>

<p>so then you rationalize jailing someone just because they say stuff...</p>

<p>so putting in people in jail just for questioning the official government / victors &quot;narrative&quot; is some how justified?  I don&#39;t think so... and why only for the Holocaust?</p>

<p><strong>Why jail someone for questioning what we are told is true about the Holocaust?  Can the truth stand on its own two feet or must it have the government jailing people to support it?</strong></p>

<p>Nothing is wrong with questioning the <strong>victors narrative</strong> the official government &quot;story&quot; of the Holocaust</p>

<p><strong>the truth doesn&#39;t need to have laws putting people in jail.</strong>  the truth is what it is...  or do you disagree with this and think that if people speak against the official &quot;truth&quot; that the government gets to establish for the Holocaust that they should be jailed.</p>

<p>I for one believe in Freedom of Speech</p>

<p>guess u don&#39;t particularly when it comes to speaking about the governments official narrative for the Holocaust</p>

<p>I guess you missed that whole part of my post about how &#39;Free Speech&#39; is not 100% &quot;FREE&quot; in the US either.  Speech that causes death or the bodily injury of another is punishable here in the US.  Stuff like inciting a riot WILL get you arrested and thrown in jail.  We do this because it&#39;s a reasonable deterrent for people NOT to incite riots that cause damage and bodily harm.  </p>

<p>The Germans initiated this law for similar reasons.  Having lived in Germany for 4 years has given me a unique perspective on this.  The German people feel an IMMENSE sense of guilt for allowing these things to happen.  Not only that, the evidence that it happened is EVERYWHERE.  From camps, to survivors, witnesses, former prison guards....the truth DOES stand on it&#39;s own two feet.  But there are a few Germans who would rather bury their heads in the sand than deal with that guilt - so they simply deny that it happened.  To put it into perspective, it would be like someone here in the US saying that 9/11 didn&#39;t happen.  Of course 9/11 happened, and I don&#39;t believe the &#39;Official&#39; story on that either.  But I am not going to say that 9/11 never happened, because that would be crazy. </p>

<p>that is a shame because there are many germans who simply had nothing to do with WW2</p>

<p>Yet why jail these Germans when they question the official narrative of the government?</p>

<p>If its the truth it should stand on its own and not need to jail people for it to be the &quot;truth&quot;</p>

<p><strong>To put it into perspective if you don&#39;t believe the official 9/11 story you should goto jail</strong></p>

<p>is basically what they are doing with the Holocaust story putting people in jail when they don&#39;t go along with the government narrative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The legislation calls for jail terms of as much as three years for &quot;intentional conduct&quot; that incites violence or hatred against a person&#39;s &quot;race, color, religion, descent or national or ethnic origin.&quot; The same punishment would apply to those who incite violence by &quot;denying or grossly trivializing crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.&quot;</p>

<p>You do not go to jail for questioning the &quot;official Narrative&quot;.  You go to jail for inciting violence or racial hatred, trivializing genocide, or outright DENYING it happened.  Big difference.  </p>
