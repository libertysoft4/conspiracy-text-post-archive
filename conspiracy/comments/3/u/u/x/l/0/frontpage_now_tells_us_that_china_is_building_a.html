They eat it just the same as anything else when they sneak into someone&#39;s garden at night.</p>

<p>Suppose you actually live in BFE though, the middle of nowhere, no civilization around for miles. You live in the US? Are you near a wildlife management area/game reserve? Odds are good they&#39;re using GMO <em>something</em> in there for the animal populations they manage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, and admittedly wild game doesn&#39;t get exposure to antibiotics (maybe? unsure on this point) or growth hormones... But they can also be disease and parasite-ridden depending on the area and what bugs have been growing in the woods. Raccoons, for instance, are some of the most filthy, parasite-infested animals you will likely ever run across. In the wild it isn&#39;t <em>quite</em> as bad, but it&#39;s still bad enough that you have to cook them carefully if you intend to eat them.</p>

<p>I understand the desire to keep away from this crap, I really do. The problem is, you have to realize that there&#39;s no telling what is and isn&#39;t GMO if they&#39;re not labeling it, or what has or hasn&#39;t ingested GMO crops. Also, depending on where you are, you can&#39;t hunt year round and there tend to be bag limits on game, so you won&#39;t be living off hunting alone any time soon. Not to mention buy-in and maintenance costs--guns, ammunition, camouflage, vehicles, feed, equipment to process them if you&#39;re doing it yourself, and of course time. It&#39;s a <em>very</em> expensive hobby to buy into if you want to do it right and get results, but after that initial buy in it tends to pay for itself over time.</p>

<p>I do, and it is. Consider this. A large deer may weigh about 140 pounds. You won&#39;t get that much meat out of it. By the time you&#39;re done cleaning it, removing the bone, and processing the meat you <em>might</em> have half that in meat, maybe. It&#39;s going to go pretty quickly. Also, to do it right, you have to prepare it so it doesn&#39;t taste too gamey. Using game to supplement your diet and lighten your food costs is great, but you can&#39;t live off it without higher investment in time, which most working people don&#39;t have. Time into managing the land/body of water, catching/hunting it, cleaning it, processing it (or paying to have it processed), time into prepping it before cooking it... Things like yoyos can help with fish, but you can&#39;t exactly use the equivalent in a snare on a deer, or squirrel, etc.</p>

<p>You say that, but you&#39;d be surprised. But yeah, cooking thoroughly is the best way to be sure either way.</p>

<p>You would be mistaken, sir. It&#39;s a common &#39;black food&#39; here--pretty much anywhere south of the Mason Dixon. I shit you not, they love it. Perhaps you shouldn&#39;t make assumptions on how others act based on what <em>you</em> would do. Personally, I think the idea of eating raccoon or crow is disgusting--hell, I don&#39;t really like squirrel either. But I can&#39;t and won&#39;t deny the truth I&#39;ve seen for myself.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No, it wasn&#39;t, in fact it was exactly on point. It seems you just don&#39;t like the idea that they&#39;re more common than you would like to believe--so of course, in your opinion, it would register as &#39;not relevant&#39;. And no, they&#39;re not monolithic, just <em>amazingly</em> more common than you want to believe, especially in the US.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>there are plenty of places on Earth left where they are not</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are, but the US isn&#39;t one of them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This attitude is self defeating</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. This attitude is realistic and will prevent you from getting conned into buying expensive &quot;non-GMO whole foods&quot; that are really just a gimmick and are, in actuality, sometimes made with GMO stuff anyway <em>because it&#39;s cheaper</em>.</p>

<p>But hey, if you&#39;d like to bury your head in the sand or some other bodily orifice and pretend things aren&#39;t as bad as they are, by all means, <em>be my guest</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can see that. Interesting articles. I feel that GM veggies are the lesser of two evils. In addition to genetic modification and antibiotics that are pumped into the animals, many are also diseased from living in their own filth, cruelty aside. Plus meat is not sustainable, especially if we are headed toward a food shortage. I&#39;m not trying to be preachy, I don&#39;t care if anyone else eats meat, that&#39;s just my personal belief. It&#39;s your health, you can make your own judgements as to whether eating meat is worth it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We all do, sweetheart. I grow a lot of my own veggies, but you&#39;re right, Monsanto has farms in a headlock and it is very difficult for ordinary people to find any type of food that has not been modified in some sort of way besides growing their own, which isn&#39;t possible for many people. So the question becomes: GM Veggies vs GM Veggies + Meat that has been pumped full of antibiotics and other nastiness. I&#39;m seriously not trying to preach, only explain my POV. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s with all the offended people, if you think meat is safe to eat, go for it. </p>

<p>Emotion does not negate the reason behind a statement or claim, this is a logical fallacy that only gets more powerful the more misogynistic our culture becomes.</p>

<p>Humans are closest related to Bonobos who are omnivores but eat vastly more plant matter than they do animal. We can see from many hunter-gatherer civilizations left over that Humans naturally eat mostly plants with a small portion of their diet dedicated to meat. This due to our poorly adapted digestive system and our inability to fell prey with our hands and teeth. The idea that we are vicious predators is a bullshit construct of the highly aggressive and patriarchal enlightenment era scientific hegemony. The more we learn about humans the more evo-psyche becomes exposed as a bogus, agenda pushing (social-darwinistic literally) psuedo-scientific field. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, they have half the arable land of the US, but meat is still rather infrequently consumed. </p>

<p>My in-laws feed all their food waste to a piglet and their brother butchers and prepares it. This will be the main meat they eat (less and less so, but still probably more than half). </p>

<p>I watched a Chinese guy come to a pub and order the most expensive thing on the menu (in China). It was a steak, looked gorgeous, but he looked scared.</p>

<p>When I ran a business, my British friend wanted to do a roast for Christmas, so we did a big hunk of beef. I had 25 Chinese employees. Most didn&#39;t even touch it, the others ate some to show how brave they are.</p>

<p>When my wife and I eat out, she generally pushes most of the meat to my plate and takes my vegetables. Meat consumption in China is on the rise, but that rise is starting from a comparably low meat consumption.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You misunderstand, they have molars and yet they are carnivores. We have incisors and yet we are naturally omnivores who ate mostly plant based diets (roughly 80% from what we can tell). My point is that just because we have incisors does not mean we are naturally predisposed to eat meat, it just means that we <em>do</em> have the capability to do so.</p>
