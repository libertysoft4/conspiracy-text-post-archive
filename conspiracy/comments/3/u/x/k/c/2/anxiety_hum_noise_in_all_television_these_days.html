        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">106</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2015-12-01 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/911bodysnatchers322.html">911bodysnatchers322</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Whenever the protagonist or other empathetic character is in trouble, facing some kind of extreme fear, anxiety, worry, intrigue, shock, or some other dire circumstances that should elicit from them the extremes of emotion, I&#39;ve noticed that television shows will emphasize this emotion with a sound editing technique I call &quot;anxiety hum&quot;.</p>

<p>This is a background sound in the midrange, a kind of vibratory hum, crescendoes louder until it drowns out all other noises including the music, and makes dialogue difficult to understand.  It&#39;s a kind of wintermute, what a person hears when a bomb goes off. (in fact, the same sound technique used after bomb does go off nearby to demonstrate ringing ears)</p>

<p>I find it difficult to believe that there&#39;s one sound engineer in hollywood that is going around promoting this &#39;anxiety hum&#39; or that people are so stupid in that sound community that they have to lemming each other with a wholly annoying noise.</p>

<p>When I watch TV with someone else, I bring their attention to this noise and they universally agree on how annoying it is.  Because you have to micromanage your volume level or else you make someone around you mad at you.  Especially if you are an aging parents couple with one hard of hearing.</p>

<ul>
<li>Homeland</li>
<li>Blacklist</li>
<li>24</li>
<li>The Man in the High Castle</li>
<li>The Walking Dead</li>
<li>Breaking Bad</li>
<li>About a million other shows</li>
</ul>

<p>So my point in posting this seemingly ridiculous rant on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is : why the F are these sound engineers doing this so consistently throughout nearly all tv shows now?  Are they catering to the 1% demographic of people with a dedicated basement home theater with 20 speakers?</p>

<p>I feel like it&#39;s some kind of pavlovian thing to engage or dissociate the viewer: it&#39;s a queue.  It&#39;s like a sound queue to concretize an indentification of the  viewer with the character and their responses.  </p>

<p>If that&#39;s the case, why?  Am we being &#39;trained&#39; how to &#39;feel&#39;?  And if so, why?</p>

<p>Maybe next time we see violence on tv, or hear a politician say a thing they want us to hear, then maybe they play that hum in the background and it will kind of cross-associate our identifying with the intended message they wish to implant?</p>

<p>Or maybe it&#39;s a bunch of sound engineers being assholes.  Who knows?</p>

<p>EDIT: this was a great discussion guys, thank you.  I didn&#39;t expect it but I&#39;m very thankful for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well ELF means extremely low frequency, it can be sound or radio (ie: light/Electromagnetic) waves.  Sound is air moving back and forth in cycles per second, 30Hz, subwoofer bouncing up and down 30 times a second.  EM is polarity rotational cycling from of positive to negative of electrical and magnetic waves carried by photons (informational photons); ie: light/radio/xray, 30Hz ELF EM cycles 30 times from posn/neg which puts it below the lowest radio range.</p>

<p>ELF sound waves are just infrasound, sound waves below the threshold of human hearing.  Not everyone is the same, some can hear lower sounds than others.  After I received ketamine treatment last year I had super-hearing for about a month, then it went back to normal. During this time, I could hear as low as 30Hz, tested with audacity. Outside, this alleged &#39;industry noise&#39; or &#39;urban background ambient noise&#39; was apparent to me as a &#39;massive diesel engine running far, far in the distance&#39;, I just called it the &#39;hum&#39;.  I tried to locate the source which was always unipolarly to the magnetic north, but it was like a rainbow, no matter how far you went you&#39;d never get to the source.  </p>

<p>I narrowed it to 30-60Hz. (I think 33Hz was what I decided it was) Also, speakers are not designed really to play that low, so it&#39;s not a great test.  Their lower limit on a subwoofer is around 40Hz but you can push the limits a bit, they just taper off in volume dramatically at that point.</p>

<p>Detecting energetic ELF is way more difficult than detecting sound.  I believe in both cases you need a large antenna because of the incredibly large length of the wave (lower the frequency the longer the wave).  </p>

<p>ELF/Infrasound affects people, it can cause them GI disturbances and have mental effects such as thinking they are seeing ghosts / supernatural phenomenon.  This is part of the sick building syndrome in which a mechanical device that runs constanly (or a suspension bridge/overpass will twist / resonate in the wind) will create a low frequency sound that disturbs people. </p>

<p>Nazi&#39;s tried to exploit this as &#39;brown noise&#39;, mythbusters tested it and said it only partially worked.</p>

<p>TV is a total mind fuck. I wouldn&#39;t doubt for a minute that the noise is some form of Pavlovian cue to heighten a sense of anxiety. I don&#39;t know if you have watch the evening news lately, but the acting out as if panicked and frightened by the anchors is ridiculous.

    <div class="md"><p>Actually I have some expertise in this matter.  I&#39;ve done significant amounts of work removing buzzing and humming from audio setups, mainly PC based.  </p>

<p>What it comes down to is shitty electronics make shitty sounds.  If any part of the component is cheap, even 1 capacitor, it can make the entire unit emit a buzzing or humming sound when on.  The backend of a TV is about as cheap as it gets.</p>

<p>It&#39;s honestly somewhat of a crapshoot with electronics whether you get one with buzz or no buzz.  Most low end models have buzz because they have more cheap parts that don&#39;t work as correctly as the more expensive options.  This can even effect high end components such as 1k$ graphics cards with coil noise.  Sometimes supply chain strains or simple greed forces manufacturers to use cheap components even in high end products.</p>

<p>Also, when a component comes under stress, it will emit any electrical noise it makes significantly louder than idle.  So with OPs theory, I&#39;d say the TV soundboards are trash and can&#39;t handle the load of a complex sound scene with dramatic music, noise, and voice.  So they heat up and whine during those moments.</p>

<p>You might be on to something though? Sound is super powerful.  I&#39;d love to see some further research and documentation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Although you are right about crappy buzzing in electronics, what I&#39;m referring to is a technique they are using purposefully in film / television to &quot;dissociate the viewer&quot; as if a &quot;bomb just went off near you&quot;.  It&#39;s that &quot;post concert / post bomb deafness noise&quot; that they play to underscore the &#39;feelings they create&#39;, like rubbing salt in the wound so you know it really hurts.  Bad analogy, but you probably get what I&#39;m saying.</p>

<p>I think this technique is annoying and overused, but surely they know this.  It&#39;s the same thing with horror movies.  Theprimary technique of neraly every horror movie these days is .... when something&#39;s about to happen to the innocent girl / couple / person, the music / sound gets LOUD Oh NO, then nothing happens, and it&#39;s quiet for exactly 3 seconds, whew.  Then suddenly MONSTER! LOUD NOISES!  It&#39;s the fake out technique that started with &quot;scream&quot;</p>

<p>This kind of formulaic thing <em>infantalizes</em> the audience.  To a degree, I get it.  Content is a <em>product</em>, a <em>commodity</em>, so you make them formulaic and expectable to an audience that just wants to enjoy their extremely limited time off from the drudgery of daily life / work.  But at the same time, it&#39;s annoying.  </p>

<p>Also, studios may be up to much more than just being annoying and predictable, if you know how to read the signs and are paying attention like some others in this thread who have pointed out obvious attempts to manipulate the mass psychology with colors, symbols, tropes, and repetitive memes all seeming to stem from the same source, a assertion that is supported by the fact that these things are far to consistent to be even &#39;copies of copies&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know exactly what you&#39;re talking about and I have a completely different story to share that I believe will help tell the story of what that sound is and what it does to us.  </p>

<p>I am a hardcore gamer.  When BF3 came out, me and my buds were playing the shit out of it, 18+h days.  That was the first FPS i played that had what I would call the &quot;deafened&quot; sound effect with that fucking tone you describe.  It happened every time a grenade went off near you in BF3 (constantly on the CQC maps I played).  That tone literally caused my ears to bleed after about a week straight.  I had to stop playing the game and I refuse to play any game that replicates that tone at all.</p>

<p>My hearing wasn&#39;t permanently damaged, but it could have been from it.  I used to have really good ears, still do, but not quite as good as when I was younger.  I used to be able to pick up on a few more electronic noise pitches than I can now.  I attribute this damage to overexposure to the tone you describe.</p>

<p>It could be being used intentionally to literally deafen people.  I could see precise placement of that tone causing some damage.  What&#39;s the difference between that tone and what happens with a case of tinnitis? NOTHING!  Perhaps the ear is just replicating what it hears (thats exactly how the eardrum works, it resonates and amplifies) and that tone is somehow getting &quot;stuck&quot; and causing damage?  Maybe I&#39;m too far off the deep end.</p>

<p>Please re-expand upon this topic, I believe others might have similar stories to share.</p>

<p>All the current spy series implicate Russia as having subverted our intelligence community for decades and that Mossad (ISIS) is our friend and cohort.  If you invert that, then you might have something that looks more like truth.  It&#39;s very obvious.  Homeland is doing it now; Blacklist has hinted at it.  Nearly all the others also point fingers at russia/ukraine / eastern bloc &#39;hackers&#39;, &#39;criminal syndicates&#39;; and / or iranian / syrian / palestinian terrorists.  Would not surprise me if the &#39;cabal&#39; in blacklist is basically run by putin or old school KGB people, the gray wolves, or the &quot;assassins&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>A couple years ago I was looking into why I felt the need to have my TV on all the time even though I may not necessarily be watching what was on. It was like it was &quot;too quiet&quot; without the TV on in the background <em>all the time</em>. During my research into why I felt this way I came across this most interesting patent;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/patents/US6506148">Nervous system manipulation by electromagnetic fields from monitors</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Computer monotors and TV monitors can be made to emit weak low-frequency electromagnetic fields merely by pulsing the intensity of displayed images. Experiments have shown that the ½ Hz sensory resonance can be excited in this manner in a subject near the monitor. The 2.4 Hz sensory resonance can also be excited in this fashion. Hence, a TV monitor or computer monitor can be used to manipulate the nervous system of nearby people.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is actually a relatively old patent filed in 2001, before the advent of the newer HDTV technology. Now they can combine the electromagnetic technology with higher frequency sound technologies to  even more effectively manipulate the emotions and nervous system of anyone that has such a device in their home. </p>

<p>I know there are a lot of people who will say they don&#39;t watch TV,  but I think the more compelling avenue of exploration are those of us here that DO watch TV, and have it on all the time. How many of us find that they like to have their TV on for &quot;background noise&quot; and find that without their TV on it is &quot;too quiet&quot; and somewhat uncomfortable? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe tinnitus is the manifestation of what I&#39;m talking about.  Modern humans are so accustumed to the artificial background hum of electronics and ELF waves that we start hearing them in our heads automatically when they aren&#39;t there.  <em>Or</em> tinnitus is our ears picking up on these frequencies which are always there, it&#39;s just that the sound of them is usually being hidden by TV or whatever other noises are present around us and so we aren&#39;t able to hear it until we&#39;re sitting in silence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone that has a great interest in scoring film/tv/projects I can tell you that the goal of proper sound is to give the scene an emotional impact that visually doesn&#39;t do well enough on its own. There are a few trends in today&#39;s scoring and audio engineering that may lead to this effect. The use of resonant filters (that ringing, usually echoing sound) and major compression to get the average listener to hear everything important and to compete with the over compressed commercials. Plus many TV&#39;s these days have built in compressors so you end up with super loud sections that the artist originally intended to be subtle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure why you were down voted. Sound design in tv&amp; movies is the whole emotional aspect. No country for old men is the only film I can actually name that has no sound track. There&#39;s no music in the movie. A common trick in movies is to have the music come from a source you see in the movie like a car stereo or a crowded bar with a jukebox or even a band. This somewhat disguises the music but right before the climax there is usually some chords or notes to build tension. The emotional payoff in a movie is when the music swells - think titanic. This is done a sports events with the national anthem and music during the game also. If you remove the music and laugh tracks in tv you will be surprised at how different it is. Some older tv shows are like this like twilight zone and it seems more like a play. </p>

<p>I think that that juxtaposition captures the psychosis of violence and depravity more than the hum.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How many have a tube amplifier?
I experience if i use the tv itself for audio i do indeed get annoyed by the static background noises. </p>

<p>But, when i watch the same shit but use my vacuum-tube amplifier for the audio. I don&#39;t hear it at all. For me it was most strange since technically speaking it should be even more defined on that... since THD is 0.2% instead of my television which i bet does around 10%</p>

<p>Hope someone else has one and has also noticed this?</p>

<p>Edit: Might be relevant, i use VHF blocking at the input stage of the amplifier.. could this block that?
i use a traditional parasitic suppressor network with resistors/cap 
(Initially i started doing this because of interference from cellphone/DECT/FM/AM sets which were annoying the hell out of me)</p>

<p>Not me. 90% went to one of a handful of film schools.  Some of those techniques trigger a Pavlovian response and some like those slowly increasing in volume or sudden loud noises have more to do with our brain&#39;s architecture.  It&#39;s obvious just watching yourself which heighten the mood and you can survey different people with the same scenes and different background audio to get more scientific results.  You&#39;re not going to use the &quot;slowly growing tension&quot; sound right as they open the door to see the killer standing there nor the &quot;shocking surprising&quot; noise when you see them sneaking around and the industry is rife with imitators. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a deliberate choice by the filmmakers to aid the narrative. You already explained why it happens in your own post:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s a kind of wintermute, what a person hears when a bomb goes off.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is intentional. It&#39;s supposed to sound like that. It&#39;s not hidden. It&#39;s not subliminal. The people making the scene want to convey that some kind of emotional bomb has dropped, or that an event or idea has shellshocked them or engrossed their attention so much that everything else around them is drowned out. </p>

<p>Look at all of the examples you chose to give:</p>

<p>Homeland -- Action thriller</p>

<p>Blacklist -- crime thriller</p>

<p>24 -- action thriller</p>

<p>The Man in the High Castle -- action thriller</p>

<p>The Walking Dead -- action thriller</p>

<p>Breaking Bad -- crime thriller</p>

<p>This hum doesn&#39;t appear in tv shows that aren&#39;t heavily dramatic with huge consequences (whether they be personal to the character or to the world at large) unless the show is aping this kind of dramatic overwhelming of a character. </p>

<p>What it isn&#39;t is some conspiracy to manipulate your emotions. And how would they be doing that, anyway? The characters undergoing this &quot;anxiety hum&quot; are typically shown to be somehow traumatized by the events--that&#39;s why they enter their trance in the first place. So this hum is training us to be traumatized by trauma?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On the sound design of The Exorcist (1973):</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cinephile.ca/files/vol6no1-complete-withbleed.pdf">http://www.cinephile.ca/files/vol6no1-complete-withbleed.pdf</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most  tellingly,  Friedkin  and  his  sound  team  utilized experimental sound techniques to further these goals and as a result the film was honoured for its accomplishments with  an  Academy  Award  for  best  sound.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[...]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Friedkin claimed that, like Hitchcock, he was attempting to manipulate the emotional responses of his audience. Yet, unlike Hitchcock, Friedkin was  not  interested  in  playing  on  the  audience’s  narrative expectations,  instead  he  preferred  to  affect  them  directly. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>[...]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Exorcist is unique in the evolution of film sound for  how  it  blurred  the  boundaries  between  sound  effects and  music. ... The first is guitarist/composer Mike Oldfield’s cisco, Nagle created sound effects by agitating several bees trapped in a jar, getting his dogs into a fight, and recording his girlfriend’s stomach while she drank water (Erlich 16). Several of Nagle’s sounds can be heard during the film’s prologue set in Iraq, and each of the sounds was treated in the  studio  to  estrange  it  from  a  recognizable  source.  This led to the creation of a number of ‘signature sounds’ within the film, each associated with a particular narrative event: the insect buzz of the amulet, the rats scratching in the attic, the bouncing bed, and, of course, Regan’s (Linda Blair) demonic head twist. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe tinnitus is the manifestation of what I&#39;m talking about.  Modern humans are so accustumed to the artificial background hum of electronics and ELF waves that we start hearing them in our heads automatically when they aren&#39;t there.  <em>Or</em> tinnitus is our ears picking up on these frequencies which are always there, it&#39;s just that the sound of them is usually being hidden by TV or whatever other noises are present around us and so we aren&#39;t able to hear it until we&#39;re sitting in silence.</p>

<p>Maybe your ears are just more sensitive than the average person&#39;s.</p>
