    <div class="md"><p>I watched this occur today and I don&#39;t think you are giving the correct picture of what happened.  The user wasn&#39;t bragging about buying upvotes, he made that post to demonstrate that reddit is subject to external vote manipulation.  The problem is that he was using that as the reasoning that certain users here were shills.  The problem comes in making the jump from &quot;shills exist&quot; to &quot;people with these points of view must be shills&quot; without any evidence offered.</p>

<p>This is what I observed:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>User made a post saying that this subreddit was overrun with shills.  His determination for what was a shill came down to disagreement with him on certain topics.</p></li>
<li><p>Flytape deletes a thread by this user for breaking rule 10.  He called me and a bunch of other people shills.</p></li>
<li><p>User creates another account with a similar name to say that he was banned.  Discussion continues, flytape explains the reason that throwing the shill accusation around in such a manner is problematic.</p></li>
<li><p>User agrees to abide by the rules, original account is allowed to post here again.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I see no problem with any of this.  The user was clearly breaking rule 10, had his account banned from the sub, then after agreeing to abide by the rules the account as unbanned.  What should flytape have done differently?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except the user in question posted a post claiming you can buy 1000 upvotes for $400, then proceeded to get 1000 upvotes.  I too have been banned before from this sub, apologized and agreed to abide the rules, and still not been allowed, especially the same exact day I was banned!</p>

<p>It was literally less then a few hours before this banned user was unbanned, along with his alt.  </p>

<p>Why is FlyTape so willing to unban this user, while others not so much?  There is definitely something afoot here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think the decision had anything to do with the number of upvotes on that post.  Those are odd and I&#39;m curious where they came from, but its a pretty big jump to associate those with flytape or his mod decisions in this case.  To me he handled a minor infraction of the rules in an appropriate way.  I think it would have been overly harsh not to unban him.</p>

<p>He was banned and appealed in mod mail like a civilized human being.  I was able to discuss the purpose of rule 10 to him in a way that he understood and he agreed to follow the rules.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A multitude of reasons.  The same reasons people are always attacking each other.</p>

<p>Politics, offended someone, difference of opinion.  Add to that me being a mod, people don&#39;t like being moderated so naturally any time someone breaks the rules they automatically assume its because I disagree with them personally or because I&#39;m trying to censor them as a shill-mod.  Rarely can they admit that &quot;oh my title was all caps and there is rule 6 for a reason&quot; or &quot;oh yeah I guess I was calling that dude a cum dumpster, I got carried away&quot;.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, sorry. He made the post before he was banned.  Then proceeded to get a shit post, claiming that vote manipulation was happening on Reddit, and that you can buy 1000 upvotes for $400, up to 1000 upvotes.</p>

<p>Are you really that dense that you don&#39;t see what&#39;s going on here?  Do you really think that this post organically achieved 1000 upvotes?</p>

<p>The fact remains you unbanned a user who is blatantly vote manipulating this sub, and this sub deserves an explanation as to why.  There was no vote (to my knowledge) of whether the other mods wanted to unban him, you took that action on your own.  I find it incredibly hard to believe that you could have voted as a mod group in the course of 2 hours when this user was banned, then unbanned.</p>
