Even the promises he makes now, will not be kept. &quot;Those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it.&quot;</p>

<p>You don&#39;t even know the difference between socialism and Communism; that&#39;s rather pathetic. You don&#39;t what a generalization is either, or a straw man. </p>

<p>Also, if you bothered to do some research, you&#39;d know Bernie is quite critical of the US support of Israel, feeling that it would be more appropriate to spend that money on economic support and the creation of a Palestinian state. He regularly criticizes israel&#39;s actions, and has for years. But you wouldn&#39;t know that, because you&#39;re a racist, hate-filled man-child who sees the world in black and white.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Where-does-Bernie-Sanders-the-Jewish-candidate-for-president-stand-on-Israel-412448">From the very video you just linked.</a> Maybe you should actually watch it; then you&#39;d know where he stands. </p>

<p>&quot;the United States has got to work with other countries around the world to fight for Israel’s security and existence at the same time as we fight for a Palestinian state where the people in that country can enjoy a decent standard of living&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My long-term hope is that instead of pouring so much military aid into Israel, into Egypt, we can provide more economic aid to help improve the standard of living of the people in that area.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Has Israel overreacted? Have they bombed UN facilities? The answer is yes, and that is terribly, terribly wrong&quot;</p>

<p>&quot; The sight of Israeli soldiers breaking the arms and legs of Arabs is reprehensible. The idea of Israel closing down towns and sealing them off is unacceptable&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;number one the Palestinian people, in my view, deserve a state of their own, they deserve an economy of their own, they deserve economic support from the people of this country. And Israel needs to be able to live in security without terrorist attacks. Those are the goals of I think any sensible foreign policy in that region.&quot;</p>

<p>Oh, is Bernie Sanders running for President of Israel? Explain to me what this has to do with the interests of the USA?</p>

<p>So, Bernie Sander&#39;s tepid criticism of the worst of the apartheid regime of Jew bigotry in Zionist-occupied Palestine is supposed to show us what? His voting record is CONSISTENT - pro-Israel, no matter what they do. Has he ever supporting cutting off their funding until they stop the genocide? Of course not.</p>

<p>Some &quot;hero of the working class&quot; - huh? Bernie Sanders taxes poor people in America to give that money to an extremely wealthy population half way around the world.</p>

<p>I think Bernie Sanders should go ahead and move to his favorite country, Israel, and leave Americans to deal with our own problems.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No, it DID NOT. It showed exactly what I said - Bernie Sanders supports the apartheid regime of Jew bigotry in Zionist-occupied Palestine and he CONSISTENTLY votes to send more money of working class Americans to one of the richest countries, per capita, in the world.</p>

<p>Got it? You and Bernie Sanders can spew all the rhetoric and bullshit you want, but the man has a LONG, LONG RECORD of ACTIONS and VOTES.</p>

<p>Orly? </p>

<p>&quot;Sanders was one of 21 of 100 U.S. senators not to sign on as a co-sponsor to Senate Resolution 498, which expressed support for Israel &#39;as it defends itself against unprovoked rocket attack from Hamas.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p>Is that also why he has a regular history of criticizing Israel, as well as Netanyahu, the Zionist poster child? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>FFS, per-capita.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Per capita, Israel doesn&#39;t even breach the top 30 by any account. Keep trying. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bernie Sanders taxes poor people in America to give that money to an extremely wealthy population half way around the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, he taxes the poor significantly less, and gives it to an allied population that is far worse off than our own... but OK.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think Bernie Sanders should go ahead and move to his favorite country, Israel</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You keep pretending Sanders has some weird love for Israel and ignoring every single fact that shows you&#39;re wrong. Do you have any kind of evidence whatsoever that would suggest it&#39;s &quot;his favorite country?&quot; Or are you just going to keep insisting on babbling incessantly about Zionism and Jews when it&#39;s at odds with reality? Hell, even the Arab American Institute supports the guy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but the man has a LONG, LONG RECORD of ACTIONS and VOTES.</p>

<p>Yes, a record that clearly shows he&#39;s quite central on the issue, but pro-Palestine state.  </p>

<p>Perhaps a better descriptor than &quot;genuine&quot; might be &quot;consistent.&quot; He has been on message his entire career.</p>

<p>And he will state over and over again that its not about him, its about that message.</p>

<p>And corporate news-entertainment dislikes him because he points out their obsession with trivial fluff and political theater  and their refusal to discuss  those issues because they are boring and dont draw rating like Trumps hair does or Carsons latest delusions do.</p>

<p>Yes. Even if Bernie got into office (never), on day one he would be told how things are gonna work by the bankers and the military-industrial complex chiefs. It is they who run the country.</p>

<p>Can you please provide some evidence that banks are funding his campaign?</p>

<p>The reason I have supported a Sanders presidential run since 2008 is precisely because he is not funded by banks.</p>

<p>If you can substantially indicate that his 2016 campaign has been funded by the financial industry (banks), I will cancel my recurring monthly $35 donation to his campaign immediately.</p>

School education sucks greatly now. The result in a generation or two who are completely ignorant or even brainwashed about reality.

<p>The sad fact is that socialism is known to scale poorly and empower elitist aristocrats, and using Europe as a comparison, much of Europe is doing about as well as Mississippi. Imagine the idiotic looks people would receive if the left told the truth and boasted they want to make all American states as great as bragged European counterparts - as awesome as Mississippi.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Why do you think Bernie is some rogue friend of the working man?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Look at his record. He&#39;s consistently been pro-Union his whole career. He was marching with an anti-Verizon workers&#39; rally earlier today. You don&#39;t see presidential candidates do that as a hollow ploy. And you can bet it will carry over to his agenda if elected president. &quot;Lord and Savior&quot; is too strong a phrase, but he&#39;s the first viable candidate to authentically give a shit about the poor and middle class in a while, and he&#39;s the only candidate to be downright hostile towards the 1% since the robber-barons were a hot button issue. And that is rightly getting a lot of people engaged when they otherwise wouldn&#39;t be.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even the promises he makes now, will not be kept</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He might not accomplish all of his goals if he wins the nomination and the general election (which I think he will, considering his weak competition) because he&#39;ll have just as hard a time getting an opposition House and maybe an opposition Senate (50-50 on whether Dems can re-take it) to move on anything on his agenda. But his message resonates with a lot of folks that are normally neglected, and that would give him a ton of leverage from the bully pulpit. Even if Congress makes him a lame-duck in his first two years of office, consistent unpopular obstruction of his policies could flip Congress for the Dems via a midterm wave.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you really think banks would fund his campaign?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not worried about the banks not backing him. Wallstreet money can afford a lot of airtime, but his message has been spreading through word of mouth and the Internet in a way we haven&#39;t seen since Citizens United and the related cases changed the game. His individual donations are ahead of pace compared to even Obama&#39;s record-breaking individual fundraising effort. It&#39;s going to be very hard (and ironic) for Wallstreet to smear him via SuperPACs if his message is that SuperPACs are corrupting the political process and Wallstreet&#39;s excesses need to be reigned in.</p>

<p>Last, I don&#39;t see why this is in r/conspiracy. Theres not a conspiracy here, nor is there even a theory. If anything, the big sham is that we have a system designed to keep non-establishment candidates like Bernie (and Ron Paul before him) out of serious contention, but he&#39;s finding a way to work around it.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re down on Bernie, Trump, and Hillary who would you support instead?</p>
