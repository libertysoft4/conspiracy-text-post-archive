<p>His goal was to take over <a href="/r/xkcd">/r/xkcd</a>, a community of over 61,000 redditors, and use it as a bargaining chip to trade for a white supremacist subreddit. Great guy, taking communities hostage and using them for his own gain. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s in a constant state of change. r/conspiracy has been in the cross hairs and under the microscope for as long as I&#39;v been here, which is 8+ years. At one time this sub was the cats ass. It was amazing how well people here worked together researching events in progress. It was pretty cool to be a part of it. But that was years ago.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not only mods who may or may have been bought to flush targeted information or promoting their beliefs while denying others, but there are more users than ever here whose sole purpose is to disrupt the flow of free thought that occurs here. Bullshit shows up on front page and controversial deep information, the kind that made this sub the target it is today is now getting purposely flushed out before it has a chance to get any attention. </p>

<p>Always go to the NEW section and keep your eye on the submissions as they come in. You will also witness solid information get down voted immediately then bullshit posts flood the new section and flush out deep information. The battle is happening in  NEW. Users should hang there and up vote the real conspiratorial and controversial info. Down vote the bullshit posts that are basically MSM propaganda and fluff that doesn&#39;t belong here. </p>

<p>Hopefully this current phase of mod manipulation will pass. But it&#39;s an unfortunate sign of the times we live in. They will constantly try to remove the knowledge that appears in r/conspiracy. We have exposed some wicked things and we are waking people up....and we are a thorn in the establishments ass...as we should be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You wait and see for yourself.  Remember the rigged recount during Bush/Gore race for President?  Do you think that was just a coincidence?  What a more perfect patsy for the 9-11 attack than Al Gore?  I mean, it&#39;s now quite obvious to all true intellectuals that 9-11 was totally an inside job amiright?  Well, you think the guys who came up with that plan are stupid?  They knew it would all be discovered as a conspiracy before it was carried out.</p>

<p>Now, in the third phase, they can use that &quot;discovery&quot; by pinning it on one of their adversaries, Al Gore.  Thus, clearing the way for Global Warming and the ability to manipulate food and fuel prices.  </p>

<p>I know it&#39;s a lot to take in.  But let me leave you with a couple questions to ask yourself:</p>

<p>1)  Who benefits from Global Warming?</p>

<p>2)  Who has a very public adversarial relationship with the NEOCONs?</p>

<p>3)  Why is Israel investing so heavily in desalination plants and air conditioning companies?</p>

<p>4)  Why was John Edwards set up by the news media and the timing was so perfect?</p>

<p>5)  Why did al jazeera buy Al Gore&#39;s Current TV network?</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t seen anything on any of this. As far as I know SovereignMan hasn&#39;t done anything wrong.
