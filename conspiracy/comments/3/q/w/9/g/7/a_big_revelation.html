        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Fellow Truther&#39;s, I have not seen this discussed or posted here on this site, and feel that now after having read it, I must share it with all of you.</p>

<p>During my reading into Egyptian mysticism I ran across a book that had been banned in America since the 1950&#39;s. A quick google search will pull of the .pdf though if you do read that version PLEASE BUY A COPY! In fact buy multiples and begin spreading them around to people who can handle the information. I highly advise that you pick up a newly reprinted copy, as originals are going for over 1,000$. This book was recommended to me by a friends father who belongs to the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry. After lengthy discussions about spiritual and cultural heritage I have been trying to link together. </p>

<p>The book is Entitled &quot;Britain, key to world history&quot;. In this book the author covers all of the stories of the Old Testament, and stories of antiquity. He concludes that Scotland, Ireland, and Briton are the true locations of the Biblical stories. IE Edinburgh is Jerusalem, Briton is Egypt, ect.. Another book i have acquired and going through a second time entitled &quot;We, the Skythians&quot;. Unfortunately I am under a non disclosure agreement at this time. </p>

<p>The book provide exhaustively detailed maps, guiding you through the stories that actually make sense with the correct landscape, in the correct context. </p>

<p>-EDIT The American declaration of Independence was inspired from the Scottish Declaratoin of Arbroath - <a href="http://www.constitution.org/scot/arbroath.htm">http://www.constitution.org/scot/arbroath.htm</a> </p>

<p>The author of this text in his letter to the Pope is alluding that he too, knows these secrets. Here is a quote. </p>

<p>enough from this: that the King of kings and Lord of lords, our Lord Jesus Christ, after His Passion and Resurrection, called them (Israel), even though settled in the <strong>uttermost</strong> parts of the earth, almost the first to His most holy faith. Nor would He have them confirmed in that faith by merely anyone but by the first of His Apostles — by calling, though second or third in rank — the most gentle Saint Andrew, the Blessed Peter&#39;s brother, and desired him to keep them under his protection as their patron forever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Britain, key to world history, comes to this conclusion via the geography described in the stories, being very detailed.</p>

<p>Skythians comes to the same conclusions via a different route. The book starts measuring the pyramids, they are perfectly aligned except certain buildings. These intentional offsets point a latitude and longitude.. Stonehenge. So we are coming to the same conclusions but different routes. Also the authors differ on the their conclusions about what caused the catastrophe that destroyed the original civilization, or who had the ability to keep perfect time, and had the perfect measurement tools, the inch. Which is a fraction of the size of the earth, and is deducible with Pi.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hardly, why would I let somebody else have all the fun of interpreting history? I wouldn&#39;t be posting here unless I was looking for unique interpretations of history. </p>

<p>My limited knowledge of Medieval history and the beast church has already proven correct here on two major points. First, this letter to the pope went to Avignon when there were several popes making laws and sending out papal bulls at this time. Also, despite all the papal ass kissing contained within, the Scots were ultimately not allowed to appoint their next or any of their kings. </p>

<p>The upshot of this document vis a vis the Declaration actually carries a great deal of mankind&#39;s aspiration for freedom from state sponsored religion, so it has had it&#39;s desired effects upon humankind. I&#39;m so very thankful for this alone, it makes your post priceless.</p>

<p>However, before you start making too much of yourself remember there&#39;s always the weight of archeological evidence, which places the early civilizations on Crete, or Santorini or whatever. You need to take a trip to Pompeii and the great coldera surrounding the island to see for yourself the magnitude of the devastation. It boggles even a nuclear weapons era mind. So, of course you are swimming against a great tide of Greco-Roman scholarship and established archeology. I always defer to Occams Razor when I&#39;m trying to puzzle something out. Good luck to you.</p>

<p>The upshot of this document vis a vis the Declaration actually carries a great deal of mankind&#39;s aspiration for freedom from state sponsored religion, so it has had it&#39;s desired effects upon humankind. I&#39;m so very thankful for this alone, it makes your post priceless.</p>

<p>However, before you start making too much of yourself remember there&#39;s always the weight of archeological evidence, which places the early civilizations on Crete, or Santorini or whatever. You need to take a trip to Pompeii and the great coldera surrounding the island to see for yourself the magnitude of the devastation. It boggles even a nuclear weapons era mind. So, of course you are swimming against a great tide of Greco-Roman scholarship and established archeology. I always defer to Occams Razor when I&#39;m trying to puzzle something out. Good luck to you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope, despite your preconceived prejudices, the Holy Bible; especially the Gospel of Luke has proven correct time and time again. Only people ignorant of the many breakthroughs in Biblical Archeology maintain the Bible&#39;s full of geographic errors. If you can site one error, I&#39;ll dispose of it tonight without much more than a Google search. </p>

<p>These exercises are a tremendous waste of time BTW</p>
