        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Let me start off by thanking you for taking the time to read this. It will with no doubt be a lot to get through and your willingness to offer your time to listen to another Human being is in my eyes proof that you will be okay.</p>

<p>A little bit about me and my journey to provide some context and hopefully some common ground, if you would like to get to the meat and potatoes, skip to the double line (====) below.</p>

<p>I grew up in Apartheid era South Africa as part of a privileged class. I am no stranger to Government controlled media, we had 2 TV channels, SABC 1 and 2. Thats is. The news format was that of old, very bland and seemed unbiased but was 100% Government controlled. Growing up I was taught and believed with all my heart, that the white South African people were the best of the best. We had the best scientists, the best athletes, the best place to live, etc. Over the years I have come to learn that this is a very common thread shared among places and countries being subverted in Conspiratorial way, especially in places where there is a need to have a justification for unmoral actions internal or external.. For example, its okay that the USA is the “world police” and the collateral damage is justified because they are protecting those who can’t protect them selves.</p>

<p>I immigrated to America because post Apartheid South Africa was a pretty violent place, the opportunities for a white person in the early 2000’s was a pretty bleak prospect.</p>

<p>I started working a corporate job straight out of college. To borrow a phrase from one of the clowns on the circus center stage, Not to be braggadocios, but I was good my job, really good. I learnt I had a skill called “interpersonal relationships” in the corporate arena, what this meant was that I fostered a very synergistic environment across function to achieve company goals far beyond my responsibility, well at least thats how it was sold to me at the time. I mentioned this because it becomes important later.</p>

<p>I discovered reddit fairly late compared to a lot of my contemporaries. I never really enjoyed 99.9% of the subs or the content, but r/conspiracy, that was something else. That resonated with me somehow but I did not quite know why yet. To be honest I am a giant lurker, this account is one of probably 5, I always forget my password and never register an email. Now if you spend some time on this sub, and you filter through the crap, which has most certainly increased in recent years, you will start to learn things that will sink down to your core and change you as a person. This is a very powerful thing. Initially you be angry, you’ll want to know how this happens over and over.. you’ll probably become depressed because you feel you can’t affect change, perhaps you’ll become that person who wants to debate any person who is “asleep”, “blind” to whats going on in order to help them, but really is just to satisfy some empty hole in your core… but eventually, you’ll come to know that you are part of the problem; You see, the issue is that once you are aware of all the shit that is this reality, and you are aware that you as a single person cannot change a thing, but yet you just tick on by, you work that job, you buy that tv, you judge that person, you lie to protect your self, you pass a homeless person, not because you are bad person, but what are you supposed to do, I have a family. My actions or means are justified because of the end.. sound familiar?</p>

<p>Now remember me trumping up how good I was at my job, I said that was important right. Well when this fundamental change took place in me I could no longer perform my job like I did before. That BS sales pitch that, “ I fostered a very synergistic environment across function to achieve company goals far beyond my responsibility”. All I saw was manipulation, I was maneuvering myself in ways that benefited me, but only serving the needs of the company, not my coworkers, nor my clients.. This is somewhat of a warning to take a break from this place pretty often. You may think this may not happen to you, but I guarantee it will. </p>

<p>This sub served to take me down a path that has had some very negative effects on the reality I have to live in, but I would not change it for anything. Ignorance may me bliss, but once your ignorance is washed away about things of this nature, you’re stuck buddy. You can’t lie to your self anymore when you know the truth.</p>

<p>.=============(edit: = was not showing)</p>

<p>Now this brings me to the main purpose of this post. This sub has served a great purpose in my life, the way I view this sub is that it is a searchable place where I can look up historical events, the authors of this history would rather have it hidden and obscured to ensure a complacent populace. After all, if we don’t play the game, they can’t either. What this sub is lacking, and what I need most desperately now, is how do we measure where we are going, is talking about all this helping? Is the exposure of the inhumanities filtering up the pyramid? I don’t know, there is just to much noise and distraction and confusion to really tell. This sub has become pretty toxic in terms of complete hogwash content and comments on here. This bad content sometimes even makes it to the front page, maybe not because people agree with it, but people tend to just want to be nasty to people who don’t share their world views, and this active “debate” usually results in the post getting to the top. This is pretty damaging to some new visitor. I know initially I never went to new, and even if you did, it was too hard to really manage all that information, the idea is that we should have a lot of people help to get the good info to the top. I understand that this is what happens, but the results are just not what it should be. Its not any one person or group or ideas fault, its just too much information.I might not think the earth is hollow, but I respect others opinions and I think debating things like that could be interesting, you certainly learn a lot about people, but something like that in my opinion should not be allowed here, I know i’ll get some flack for that.</p>

<p>Okay, so what should happen? Well this is just my opinion, and my analytical brain trying to breakdown the problem. I doubt this will happen, hell i doubt that many even got to here. Perhaps my title sucked.</p>

<p>Break this sub into categories to better control the flow and more importantly the reference frame in which content is consumed. I have made the 4 categories listed below, names are just names, they can be whatever. 4 is also just some arbitrary number to effectively contain information and prevent contamination.</p>

<p>conspiracy_confirmed, conspiracy_verified, conspiracy_evidence, conspiracy_infancy.</p>

<p>conspiracy_confirmed</p>

<p>This is for content that has been confirmed with verifiable evidence from multiple sources that are in agreement, and Ideally has a party owning up to the mistake</p>

<p>conspiracy_verified</p>

<p>This is for content that has a lot of evidence that is not easily denied. This should also be content that when the reader looks at it they can have a pretty good trust than its true and no one is trying to sway them</p>

<p>conspiracy_evidence</p>

<p>This is for any content that has some piece of compelling evidence, for instance, because some ancient cultures have hollow earth drawings, or lets just say thats how they are being interpreted, content like that could be here. Its always good to be able to verify evidence is authentic and correctly interpreted, but this should not be a requirement for this category.</p>

<p>conspiracy_infancy</p>

<p>Anything goes here, this is where a lot of interesting discussion could happen. Very stimulating thoughts, what ifs. just a place where people can let their minds run a muk in a place where the reference frame in not to take this too seriously. People posting here are aware they have no evidence, they are just sharing their thoughts. as long as its not bigoted or festered in hatred or superiority, its okay to talk about.</p>

<p>Okay, so if this happens I believe 2 very important things happen. First of all, this means that as an image, “conspiracy theorists” can point to conspiracy_confirmed as the standard, Irrefutable historical events that were conspiracies. The hollow earth, or moon hologram crud won’t taint the authenticity,relevance and importance of the main idea behind this sub. I can’t stress how important this is, its like if you had a friend who lied 50% of the time, how would you trust anything they told you, well if you knew they only lied on even hours, well then you can trust them 100%, if you know when to ask them something. I know this is a very terrible analogy, but I want to stress that this cultural perception would do more than any one conspiracy to let people lower their guards and open the doors of their minds.</p>

<p>The second things this does, is it gives us a way to measure the progress of conspiracies. At some point any conspiracy could have been in the conspiracy_infancy group, but as people came forward, as research is done, these conspiracies graduate.. they become fact rather than theory. This is a very powerful thing. We can have a clear and scientific way of showing how things that were once crazy talk, is now known fact. We can measure the incoming and outgoing rates. How to interpret this numbers is up for debate, but potentially, if we see less and less conspiracies coming in, and more and more moving to confirmed, we can deduce with some level of certainty, that the exposure of conspiracies in a factual evidence based reference frame is changing the way people live and affecting the system to behave better, maybe at least.</p>

<p>This does mean that these will be a huge task of moderation.. who does that and how it happens.. maybe its not even possible, I don’t know this answer, I don’t even know how to approach the problem. What I do hope is that this serves as think tank to explore this idea, its validity and potential, and how something like this would work in the real world.</p>

<p>Well I suppose thats enough for one day, I hope that someone at least found this comforting in the fact that someone shares their experience. We are all one, and as cliche as that seems, its a universal truth. Your actions will bare weight on more people than just you, even after you are dead, they will still live with your legacy, vice versa to. I have traveled enough to know people all want the same thing, and its not much, it does not even cost money. I hope everyone has a great day, and hey if you see someone in need, just say hello, you don’t need to solve their problems, you don’t even need to help them with material goods, but sharing in their experience will mean the world to them, it will make you happier and it will make the world a better place. Remember, “Its just a ride” - B.H.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for your personal history.  Translating knowledge into real world decisions is a challenge for me as well.  Despite the fact that I view the entire financial system as a big pyramid scheme that could crumble at any moment, currency is still required to operate in the world.  </p>

<p>I have to disagree with your proposal for implementing classification for ideas.  This would mean that an individual or group would be required to make these judgements.  To me that would create more problems than it solves.  There would be endless debate over individual classifications and it takes away some of the opportunity for each user to do their own thinking, giving it to the label assigning authority instead.  The ability to assign these labels would be more influential than a moderator position here so it would be very valuable and therefore a target.   Also <a href="/r/conspiracyfact">/r/conspiracyfact</a> already exists and is not at all active.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand your sentiment, but I have to ask is currency really &quot;required&quot;? I would have to say its only working to keep the current program in place, so what if many people decided to be on a different page. What if 99% who have no chance of getting anything currently just decided that we value other things and money is rejected in favor of living in a simple way. I think this is the issue many get stuck on, I know I did for a long time, and that is you want change but you also want to live a life of modern comfort. I don&#39;t blame anyone because its scary to make that leap and at the moment I think this is a far too risky and radical idea for most to get behind, honestly I don&#39;t think anyone trusts in the goodness of our species yet. But here is the bottom line everyone, all we need and all we have ever needed is food, water, and air in order to live, yet somehow we have become so warped from nature that we stand by and allow those essential things needed for life to continue to be destroyed in order to collect money. WTF?!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t phrase my statement on currency very well.  I wasn&#39;t saying that a society cannot operate without currency, just that it would be very difficult for me to take a personal position to abstain from any currency use and be able to function in society as it is now.</p>

<p>I think that the convenience of having a means of exchanging value is important.  The problems come in with lending, manipulation of currency supply, manipulation of interest rates, etc.  The evil of the system is in these practices, not the existence of currency itself.  I am not knowledgeable enough to propose a good alternative system, but I think there are better options that still include a common means of value exchange.  If we reject that then we are left with direct barter which can be difficult in practice and doesn&#39;t scale well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah ultimately I hope to learn something from anything I do that will make my life better and serve a purpose for others, and you are very right that making those decisions based on what you read or are told is a dubious task at the very least. This is why I think segregating information will enable you to make better decisions, even if that decision is as trivial as “okay I will read this and give it some thought”. Its very hard to make that simple choice when you you think the the information you are reading is nonsense made up by tinfoil nuts.</p>

<p>Yes the global financial system is in my opinion the mother of all conspiracies. Money is created out of debt where any fiat currency is in place, and it is usually the driver behind everything else. Thats a gross generalization, so don’t get to worked up about it. Also, I have to disagree with your premise that we have to have money to make the world work. In the system we live now that is probably true, but there are other ways of doing things, to assume that money is something that has to exist is point of view that closes down so many avenues in your mind. If you would like to discuss this further I would be happy to. Hey, and what I just said it just my opinion, I could be wrong too you know, and if you can convince me I would be grateful, there are few things I enjoy more than that feeling where someone says something that makes your brain rewire it self.. so exhilarating.</p>

<p>I am not proposing on classifying them on some arbitrary themes or having someone judge them on a whim. I am proposing that as a community we come together and agree to set of requirements that are based in fact and not opinion that we can then use to better structure the information. I completely agree that this is still very challenging to do, and that if the wrong people are at the helm you’ll have a system that is broken. I also do not want do discourage any discussion from taking place, it would be great if <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> could be the aggregate of everything, yet having somewhere I can go and be 100 percent sure that what I’m reading is fact. We as a community should be able to challenge the status of any conspiracy.</p>

<p>Do you think r/conspiracy is working as well as it could, do you think its an effective tool to educate someone who is not aware of the state of the system or some of the darker sides of history, and if you don’t think its working as well as it could, what do you think would be a solution to the problem?</p>

<p>Thanks for your response/ I actually like points of view that appose mine; thats how we get good discussions going, being in an echo chamber is a very dangerous thing.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That isn&#39;t my premise.  I&#39;m saying that I cannot personally make the choice to stop using currency no matter my feelings on it&#39;s legitimacy.  I can think about how the world could be, but I still have to operate in the world that is.  The fact that everyone around me has faith in the paper compels me to participate as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>yet having somewhere I can go and be 100 percent sure that what I’m reading is fact.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That place does not exist.  There are information sources that are 100% genuine in that they are delivering what they believe to be fact, but it just isn&#39;t possible to have that level of factual certainty on these types of topics.  It would be extremely comforting to be able to think that the information you get from a certain source is 100% factual, but to me that is a trap.  The only thing you should really trust is your own ability to logic and reason.  Be very cautious against letting down your guard and allowing a person to dictate things to you as truth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am proposing that as a community we come together and agree to set of requirements</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t think of this place as a community.  There are too many different motivations of users here.  Creation of a common community voice is an exploitable goldmine for those whose job it is to create opinion.  I don&#39;t speak for anyone else and I absolutely don&#39;t want anyone else expressing opinions in my name.  Too often the community voice is used as a strawman.  I think the strategy to avoid discreditation by association is to point out that there is no association.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you think r/conspiracy is working as well as it could</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given the baggage that comes along with being on the reddit platform, I think it functions fairly well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>do you think its an effective tool to educate someone who is not aware of the state of the system or some of the darker sides of history</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, absolutely not.  For someone who completely believes the mainstream line on everything it would not be a good idea to just link them to this subreddit.  You could however find specific posts and present them in a certain order along with discussion to demonstrate certain things.  Trying to inform an individual person is a task specific to that individual depending on their current world view and background.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah yes, sorry I misunderstood your comment about money; more than likely I was just to eager to respond without taking the time to fully digest it. Yes I completely agree that making “it work” with within the bounds of your reality is just what you have to do, no and’s, if’s or but’s about that. Its not something I do with apathy though, I hate it. This is a sticky one, and certainly not something I will se “solved” in my lifetime. Its also not something I know how to solve, its a pretty big and complex issue. What I do know though is, that getting people to buy into the pervasive issues that our current money system produces is a tall task, especially when its packaged with everything else “conspiracy”. That word is a dirty one as I’m sure you know, and many people just shutdown when they hear that. I want to change that, and best I can think of is to get people to have more faith in the information. Thats my main want from segregating the information.</p>

<p>Yeah I should have worded that better. 100% was just not a good idea. Of course there is no source you can trust a 100%, and yes, of course you should always be vigilant of anything you digest, no matter what the source is, or what its history is. However I still think that there is value in being able to separate information based on some sort of measurement of validity and factual accuracy. I completely agree and understand that to get to this point you have many roadblocks, there are many glaring issues you have to solve, and even more nuanced issues that aren’t apparent I’m sure. Perhaps I need to think more about this, its clear i don’t quite fully understand what it would take and how to protect it. Its a tough one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t think of this place as a community. There are too many different motivations of users here. (left most of the quote out, please go read it in full to have the correct context)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yea its sad that your statement is very true. I would also not presume to talk for anyone, and like you, certainly don’t want anyone talking for me. I will say and I should be careful because even the innocent look guilty defending themselves, but I have no agenda here, well I suppose I do somewhat. I just want to be able to have a resource that is organic and active, where truth is the only objective. I only want this resource so that it is available for anyone to consume without having all the distraction of a lot of the discussion that goes on here. There are so many people that are intelligent, and I know if they spent the time with the information, they would care more about the issue and it would become something important to them. Just mention r/conspiracy can shut down down an opportunity to have a meaningful discussion with someone. Its easy to say, well those people are closed minded and this and that, and some of that may be true, but I know I’ve been there too, and I don’t want to just give-up. I want help people get to a place where they care about educating them selves.</p>

<p>Also, while I agree with you that this place is not a community at the moment, maybe a completely dysfunctional one if anything. I really hope that that will change, and rallying around the idea of making truth available in a easy to digest format is probably not that bad. I don’t expect us to agree on everything, hell I don’t want that at all, I would want us to disagree on most everything at first, but through taking the time to discuss things, listening to each other, talk about all the nuance of what we are doing, making concessions and compromises, and doing this consistently. Then we become a community, not where we have a leader, but we all participate and are equals.</p>

<p>PS: This paragraph above makes me sound like I’m living in LALA land, I completely understand this is a very rosy view of things, a pipe dream of sorts. People are a difficult and unpredictable animal. I don’t think this will just materialize. I just care a great deal about this sort of thing and think about ways to make it better and more importantly I want to be something that is shaped by everyone that is sincere about truth.</p>

<p>I really do appreciate your responses, its clear you took the time to think about what I said and that you care and believe in what you say, its given me something to think about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks.  You sound like someone I would like to have discussions with face-to-face.</p>

<p>For the power of the label &quot;conspiracy&quot; I think it is important to show people the origin of the word (here is a thread on that topic: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3pz678/in_1967_the_cia_created_the_label_conspiracy/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3pz678/in_1967_the_cia_created_the_label_conspiracy/</a>).  Also ask them who gets to decide which ideas get this label?  You can go a little deeper discussing psychological techniques of associating words with concepts (ie conspiracy = not true).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Likewise, however this format lets me put my best face on display. I tend to get very passionate when I&#39;m discussing something I believe in. This usually results in my voice rising. Most see this as aggression but it&#39;s not. I really appreciate people that will stick it out and keep on going, having someone change how view the world is borderline orgasmic. </p>

<p>I totally feel you with the whole conspiracy theory phrase smear campaig... However, I come back to my point of, if this person is informed mainly by the official narrative, and then there is r/conspiracy and everything we covered today. Getting them to buy into that a futile effort..</p>

<p>I want my cake and eat it too. I have an idea and will make a post about it later tonight. Would love your feedback.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as I know, there is simply no way to &quot;divide&quot; a sub. The only thing we could do would be to use flair to tag categories. But the main problem with that is then mods would have to be <em>very</em> familiar with each and every conspiracy theory out there. We would have to perform a lot of research, including reading each and every submission, to be able to discern whether one is &quot;confirmed&quot; or &quot;verified&quot; etc. And we&#39;d also get constant arguments from people saying we tagged something wrong.</p>

<p>There is something each and every user can do themselves. There already exist other subreddits similar to each category you mentioned. You can find them here: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/subreddits/search?q=conspiracy">https://www.reddit.com/subreddits/search?q=conspiracy</a>. Redditors can create their own &quot;multi&quot; subreddits. Simply type in into your address bar: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditname1+subredditname2+subredditname3">https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditname1+subredditname2+subredditname3</a>. Then bookmark it. In this way you can organize any number of groups of subreddits any way you want. </p>

<p>That may not be exactly what you&#39;re looking for but hopefully it&#39;ll be close.</p>

<p>Edit: Thank you for your suggestions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I was writing the post I assumed I was covering a lot of ground on things that may already exists. I don’t know much about reddit and all its features to be honest.</p>

<p>Could you please list the subs that you mention already exist? I’m assuming they are not quite literally what I listed, heh. ;) ill do a google search as well and look at the sidebar. </p>

<p>I do love the vast discussion that happens in this sub, I feel it is by far the most relevant sub to my (negative) experience in this world, its something really important to me and the world.However the noise completely destroys what I feel this sub could mean. I mean if our goal here is to talk about the things powerful people do to promote their needs at the expense of (innocent) people in a secretive way, what does that mean? Just to talk about it. I don’t think serves a whole lot of value, when as I mentioned you are competing with noise. Its what destroys this subs validity among the masses. What we are really doing here is talking about History, history that the victors try and lie about. Understanding history is a pretty big part of protecting yourself from it repeating, or so I have been told. I think if we can effectively establish trust across the board, we start by achieving a larger goal of educating people; I would like to think there is a critical mass that when hit, the system will have to adapt, hopefully in a peaceful way.</p>

<p>I know there are tags, I have seen some subs use them to great effect. r/woahdude comes to mind. I would still like to see different subs used for the factual rating of the historical event. Tags would be a great way to assign an area where this event took place. GOVT, MEDICAL, WAR, FINANCE. I really get giddy thinking about the possibilities of mining the data for patterns.</p>

<p>Anyways, I appreciate your comment, and from your tone I can tell you have been through the trenches too. Have a good day friend.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a Software Engineer by trade, I might build something that aggregates content from r/ conspiracy and presents it in the way I mentioned. It would rely on folks tough to help classify, and it&#39;s a challenge to get folks to buy in and use yet one more tool.</p>

<p>Ps: buy in as in decide to use it, I would do this out of conviction. It would be free and free(opensource)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>r/conspiracy is a great place in that we can discuss so many things thats so important to our lives. This however comes with a price tag of having to filter out the crap. For some people that may not even be a possibility without a massive time investment. This also makes this sub an easy target to bash, and it limits the potential audience. Since we talk about some serious things here thats a real problem in my opinion.</p>

<p>Is it possible to group information in such a way to still allow for broad and open discussion, but also bring some credence to the community so that we can reach a wider audience as well as get some metrics on the conspiracy sphere.</p>

<p>I know your time is limited and sometimes you just can’t read everything you’d like to; if you can spare 5 min the next time you are pooping or waiting for kettle to boil, give it a read if the TL;DR peaked your interest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. I went through a big conspiracy phase. Over a number of years I kept breaking through to higher and higher understandings. Oh its the government, no its the corporations that control the government, no its the bankers that control it all, no its the illuminati, no its alien consciousness, no its BLAH. Its all bullshit, and it never ends. </p>

<p>The point of the quote is to point to the fact that by the time we piece anything together, the system has already moved to nullify the effectiveness of that information. Imagine countless layers of cryptographically secured power. Shell companies, shadow agreements, ideological fronts, a giant incomprehensible pile of shit.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter how we break it down. At some point we have to throw our hands up in the air and ask &quot;what can we really know?&quot; There is absolutely a use in discovering and disclosing the kind of deception that goes on. The use is that we realize just how complicated and tricky it all is, we realize just how dark it can all get.</p>

<p>You reach a point where you understand that basically everything is not the way it seems. Everything that you thought was good is actually evil masked as good. Everything you thought was bad was actually good being bashed and tarnished to look evil. Not so simply but this is the idea. And then so what? At this point nothing that comes out of this sub is any surprise anymore.</p>

<p>This is when you move on, but how? If you actually care to <em>do</em> anything about this you will have to get creative, and connect with others who have arrived at this scope of the problem. This is why I posted the link to <a href="/r/criticalactivism">/r/criticalactivism</a>.</p>

<p>Moving beyond fear is no simple task. It will change you. This is a task of biblical proportions for both the individual and for all of us as a whole.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am having a hard time with my response. I&#39;m not entirely sure what the jist of your response is. Everything you know is wrong, the rabbit hole goes deep, and its never ending. At some point you just have to give up.. Then when you don’t know who the enemy is, or what is really what, you advocate to get creative and band with like minded people who also know you can never know the real truth and do what exactly?</p>

<p>Look, I think we all have had revelations about how deep the rabbit hole goes, and this has happened more than once more than likely. And yes, you are correct  in saying that the target is always moving. Thats just the nature, of well,  nature. You are also likely correct in saying that it never ends, especially with the current level of consciousness among your average person. The reason its never ending is because we allow it to never end.</p>

<p>However, you might have noticed that I did not really talk about any particular conspiracy; my goal is not to promote one thing over another. I don’t care about weighing the significance of conspiracies either. The way you talk about conspiracies, especially at the upper echelons, make it seem as if you view them as if they are other worldly, not comprehendible by mortals. This is simply just not true, they are nothing more than historical events, portrayed by nothing more than human beings. Sure some are extremely involved and complex and have a lot of parts, but its just history to me.</p>

<p>Say foxiness/cnn what ever, any outlet that can reach a vast number of the populous, if they broadcast to their audience “Conspiracy Theorists” are becoming a issue to worry about because they are advocating 9/11 was an inside job and want Bush arrested for war crimes, these people are unstable etc, etc. If any reasonable person that is not going to invest a lot of time goes to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, which is likely where they will go if they do a search on it, and mind you if the program did not list it in the first place. It would not be unreasonable for them to believe the sentiment raised.. because r/conspiracy looks like a schizoid bipolar mess..</p>

<p>All I am advocating for is structuring the information we have in a way that makes it possible for a layman to understand whats going on and to see the vastness of it all. I am very opinionated, so please bare with me, and I am always willing to listen to others in the hopes of learning. I believe that if enough people come to the realization of what our reality consists of, the jig will be up. They can’t play their games if we don’t play with. Thats obviously much simpler than the reality there of, but consider if people are united in that they know the system is broken and allows for abuse, I can’t help but believe people will band together, they will survive with each other and the system will fall when no one is playing their game.</p>

<p>Please don’t take my words to mean that I am saying if we can order our information better the world will be fixed, thats not gonna happen. But I think being able to communicate effectively with people is a fundamental step towards raising awareness. I promise you the folks that have it in their interest to have the status qou stay just that, are working hard to have people NOT communicate with each other, they want us fearing everything and staying in our boxes.</p>

<p>Anyways, hey man, Thanks for recommending it that sub, i’ll check it out for sure. Community is very important to me and I think something our culture lacks and that allows a lot of this crap to go on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I totally get what you are saying. Having a really solid center for sorting out information is a great idea. I have been pursuing this for quite some time.</p>

<p>I will try to explain the limitations of mass apocalypse.</p>

<p>Check out this doc: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWq5YnH6n6c">Mark Corske&#39;s ENGINES OF DOMINATION </a></p>

<p>This explains history through the lens of deception, exploitation, domination, domestication.</p>

<p>So lets say we create this perfect conspiracy site and anyone who goes to it realizes right away that they are being deceived. They realize that their existence is a near perfect analog to a cow on a farm. What now? The apocalypse goes from wildfire to skies alight with smoke and inferno. What now? WHAT NOW?</p>

<p>Do you think that apocalypse (revealing of truth) will do anything to change the cyclical nature of our enslavement? Revolution is BUILT INTO THE SYSTEM. Its a captured institution. So what now?</p>

<p>My conclusion is that mass enlightenment would be the only way to effectively change this endless self-destruction. A NEW TYPE OF PERSON is required for a NEW TYPE OF PEACE. I will give you some hints. We would have to be self-sufficient in action, not constantly waiting on authority. Who would build a new system in the interests of the people? Participation is nearly impossible with cows who only do what they are told and are completely unable to use and act upon their OWN IMAGINATION. A new culture of cooperation will have to replace the competition which has wasted so much and pushed us all into FEAR and artificial SCARCITY.</p>

<p>Get it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I also dislike the explicit antisemitic bias of this sub. I know Jews and Israel are the subject of very many conspiracy theories and I think it&#39;s a damn shame because <strong>in my opinion</strong> it has less to do with &quot;truth-seeking&quot; and more to do with &quot;finding information to support my pre-existing bias.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I&#39;m not sure exactly. I can tell you I really enjoy visiting the sub because I find most everyone to be open-minded, intelligent, and sincere. I would say just continue with, and promote the respectful exchange of ideas, maybe have the mods intervene less, I don&#39;t have this issue but I hear a lot from others that this is a problem. </p>
