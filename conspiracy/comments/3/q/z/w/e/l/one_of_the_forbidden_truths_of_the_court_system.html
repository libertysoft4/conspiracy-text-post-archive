        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;There are NO Judicial Courts in America and have not been since 1789. Judges do not enforce Statutes and Codes. Executive Administrators enforce Statutes and Codes.” (FRC v. GE 281 US 464 Keller v. PE 261 US 428, 1 Stat 138-178)</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>If you go to court and a judge tells you that he or she is the judge of the law, just say “I object!” And then read the content in the block quotation above out loud to the judge. US judges aren’t really judges. Instead, they are public trustees pretending to be Executive Administrators!</p>

<p>One of the first things you need to do when you are in a courtroom is to tell the judge which role you are playing. Why? Because courts in the USA (this also applies to courts in other Western countries) are all based on presumption.</p>

<p>In other words, it is a “game”. This is why it is called a “court-room”. What do people do in a court? They play games, like a basketball game or a tennis game. They didn’t call it the “court” or the “court-room” by accident. Are you starting to see the big picture?</p>

<p>When you walk into the court, you are about to play their game; therefore, the judge automatically presumes that you are playing the role of the trustee (slave). To trick you to consent to be the trustee, the judge will ask you if you are the legal name (i.e., JOHN DOE), which is the name on your driver’s license, birth certificate, etc.</p>

<p>If you answer yes to being that legal name, you just agree to be a legal fiction, which is a corporation. A corporation is a “corpse” or dead entity. If you look at the word “corporation” closely, you can almost see the word “corpse” in it. This is no accident. It is right in your face folks!</p>

<p>In legal term, a corporation is an artificial person. If you want proof of this, look at Black’s Law Dictionary 6th Edition for the legal term “corporation” and you should see this definition, “an artificial person or legal entity created by or under the authority of the laws of a state.”</p>

<p>Once you agree to be a legal fiction (corporation), it puts you under their jurisdiction. This means that you have to play under their rules. As a result, it is pretty much game over. Why do you think most people don’t win court cases?</p>

<p>Instead of agreeing to be that legal name or legal fiction, tell the judge that you are the Administrator of that legal name. If you want to learn how to effectively defend yourself against the corrupt Western court system, you need to study Natural Law, trust law, contract law, common law, canon law, and admiralty/maritime law.</p>

<p>Once you gain enough knowledge of these laws and learn how to use them to defend your natural rights, judges and attorneys will run away from you like scared little children. For proof of this, watch the short video below.</p>

<p>edit: It was <a href="/r/CommonLaw">/r/CommonLaw</a> </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CommonLaw/comments/uobiw/what_was_in_rcommonlaw_will_now_be_in_rusufruct/">https://www.reddit.com/r/CommonLaw/comments/uobiw/what_was_in_rcommonlaw_will_now_be_in_rusufruct/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is that when freemen play these games with the court, the court refuses to play. We may very well be some sort of legal fiction but when a &quot;real&quot; man stands before a court to explain how he knows all about it and is refusing to allow jurisdiction, the courts do not honor his &quot;evidence and either continue to levy a fine or jail sentence regardless of his claims. </p>

<p>In other words, what good is this defense if the courts deny it? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are thinking like a defendant, If you have done no wrong, and they are trying to railroad you, their at fault.
See this is the problem with our society. We have been brainwashed to think that the courts have all the power, and the only reason why they do is because we are ignorant of what courts actual are who we are.</p>

<p>A court is a place to hear a matter. If someone brings you into the court under false pretenses, its just you correcting the record, since you dont belong their in the first place. If they continue to proceed without heading the mans words then you have remedy for that and you bring them into your court after they have had ran their court and you were unable to run you court before they do.
Nobody is immune to wrong doing, and when they dont settle the matter with honor and end up in court themselves their the ones that have to answer. There are times when agents are protected and the corruption will prevent cases from moving but it doesn&#39;t last forever. Your conduct determines the outcome of any matter. And eventually people see you are trying to do the right thing and help you.</p>

<p>Also I am not speaking about freeman principals, the jurisdiction thing might actual not work esp in the U.S. This is more about letting them know that your not apart of their club. and you are operating within the law by letting them know that, its not a crime. You dont have to quietly assume all of the roles their asking you to play, you can ask questions and require compensation without being in breach of law.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. One time and charges were dismissed, but I acted honorably and so I didn&#39;t really need to say much.</p>

<p>If you get a chance watch the count of monte cristo sometime. It really lays this out if you look at the metaphors. You are either a spectator or a participant in your life. Its really up to you to chose which one you want to be. Both have the same levels of risk, one makes you feel better about your life an the other makes you wish you were never born.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is difficult. I requires educating yourself before you get yourself into a situation you will regret being in had you not learned how to access this knowledge..
After 300 plus years of dumbing down the people we know do not possess basic critical thinking skills that are based on a trivium method of education and Natural Law.</p>

<p>So im sorry if its difficult, but its important for all of us to learn understand these concepts unless we want to continue to be enslaved by systems of control and allow the world to be destroyed by people who know how to manipulate the minds of men and women.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just think it&#39;s a very difficult angle of attack at the problem and is kind of like a roll of the dice in a lot of ways. I respect anyone who wants to try it, but I&#39;d rather take the angle of attack of trying to educate the public in general instead of fighting the system directly, me vs the system. I&#39;ve lost that battle a few times, so now I just try and inform people about things that are important. I think if everyone agrees having a government is pointless, then it would cease to exist. Which is similar to your idea, I think, I just prefer to have the masses take incremental steps with my help, rather than fight the legal system directly with just myself and my own education. But I respect it, it&#39;s just not what I would choose because I&#39;ve had a lot of seriously bad experiences. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hear you, we all have different area&#39;s we should be in. You sound like you are in an area that you need to be in to be the most helpful.</p>

<p>I just dont want you to get yourself into a situation where you dont know how to proceed.  Because then their just going to do what they think its best for you instead of you making those decisions. and then the justice system is interested in making money off of you and at your expense. </p>

<p>The problem is not so much rolling the dice when it comes to facing the court. The problem is knowing you own maturity level and learning how to deal with conflict constructively.  The people that get thrown in jail most are the people that think that the world has wronged them and they have to get back at the system in anyway they can. I still have a problem with that myself and find myself getting angry when someone doesn&#39;t see things my way.</p>

<p>So its not so much what you say, its how you say it and your intent behind the message that really makes all the difference. When you are in court you keep calm and make you claims in such a way as to phrase it as a question. Statute courts are all about presumption and if you are rebutting that presumption by saying things like &quot;Its my understand that...Does the court see this another way?&quot; All you are doing is making yourself understood. When you dont bring clarity to the court, the are going to go with their interpretation of everything and you will pay the maximum price because of it.</p>

<p>If they try to slot you into a defendant catagory instead of a man catagory, there is no reason why you can say, &quot;hey if you want me to assuming that role, then as a man I have to charge for my time because my time and freedom is valuable, im sorry.&quot;</p>

<p>If they throw you in jail for that, then their in dishonor and its going to look bad for them when the next judge reads the transcript. All of this should be done in writing btw very little actual speaking should happen. </p>

<p>Also there are some battles you dont want to fight, some people would rather not fight parking tickets and others its a principal to fight it. There is nothing wrong with making up your mind what you want to fight and not fight, just know what you are getting yourself into, dont let them operate on presumptions at your expense, thats all I ask.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For U.S individuals there is a simpler way to deal with natural right violations , instead of going though the whole &quot;I object&quot; thing which creates conflict, and cant get you thrown in jail initially its better to not talk to the court except in writing and get the judge/magistrate to read it into the record. If you have time before going to court you would submit and affidavit stating that you are a man and you require a man to come forward with a claim that you have done wrong. If the court cannot produce a man that has a claim against you then you require that the case be dismissed. Then attach a fee schedule letting the judge know by name that for every minute you are held in custody without a man bringing a claim against you that he can be held liable for damages and compensation man to man.</p>

<p>If you dont have time the first thing you do is to write that on a piece of paper and submit that to the court before answering any questions and have the judge read it into the record. Continue to repeat that your claim has been handed to the court if they try to distract from your claim.
If he asks you if you understand the charges against you, let the court know that you do not speak legalese and you are an idiot (Man that is not a professional within that particular statutory jurisdiction) and that there is no law requiring you to speak the courts legalese language.</p>

<p>Stick to your story no matter what happens.</p>

<p>If you have done no wrong under common law, its really better to submit a claim of trespass against your property (rights are property) who arrested you before you go to court so that you are on the offense instead of on the defense. Then you can call attention to the fact that their case need to be suspended until your case is heard in a common law court. Common law takes precedence over statutory law. You need to move that case into your court ( a common law court) and you need to know how to move your own cases so I would research karl lentz&#39;s talks on talkshoe if you have to go that far.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry but this is idiocy and doing this in court will only fuck your case.
I&#39;m well aware of the nasty corruption that exists in our government but showing up to court and saying that youre exempt from laws in a court of law is the most ridiculous thing you can do. By being in the US you tacitly or explicitly state that you agree to live under its laws. What he should have done is gone the route of &quot;this is my property, property is used to hold or maintain items he owns, therefore it is completely lawful to use his property as he pleases, then include a rough sample of how cars have been getting broken into around the city and he was plainly protecting his property and is planning to turn his front yard into a larger drive way to accommodate the several cars he or his family owns&quot;. The point is to get the judge to see the reason of your actions not to act like an anarchist and accusing a persons life&#39;s work (judge) a fraud. A judge interprets laws, laws which can imprison or even kill you. Always try to get the judge on your side do not act like this man in court ever. You will never get the outcome you desire acting like this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only problem with this is that if you do not agree with them that JOHN DOE is your name, and you do not give an alternative name or identification, then you WILL be thrown in jail for contempt of court, at least in the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (Corporate entity). For every time this works, hundreds of times it does not. I&#39;ve actually read a lot about this and have considered doing this myself, but people should be aware of what they are getting themselves into by standing up to the system in this way.</p>

<p>Your link is relevant to the canadian system. The US system does not play by the rules the way the canadian system does. </p>
