        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First off:  Don&#39;t do anything to violate Reddit&#39;s terms of service.  I&#39;m posting this as awareness of this person and his subs dedicated to harassment.</p>

<p><a href="/u/duckvimes_">/u/duckvimes_</a> also mods quite a few other subs dedicated to harassment of users in this sub besides the two mentioned in the title.  He monitors postings here and then posts them to his harassment subs and then the users come here and downvote your posts, as well as say terrible things about you in their harassment subs and oftentimes violate the terms of service and harass you here too.  I believe he may also being working to dox you, as he is mod of <a href="/r/splcenter">/r/splcenter</a> which is a real life <a href="http://www.thesocialcontract.com/answering_our_critics/southern_poverty_law_center_splc_info.html">hate group</a> dedicated to destroying the lives of people who don&#39;t agree with the party agenda and he uses bots to track and document user post history such as <a href="/u/IRCR_Info_Bot">/u/IRCR_Info_Bot</a>, his sub wiki is dedicated to tracking certain users of this sub, and <a href="https://www.np.reddit.com/r/duckvimes/comments/33xrk9/alt_accounts_v2/">he attempts to link different usernames to a single person.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.np.reddit.com/r/isrconspiracyracist/wiki/topracistposters">https://www.np.reddit.com/r/isrconspiracyracist/wiki/topracistposters</a></p>

<p><a href="/u/redditlogsyourposts">/u/redditlogsyourposts</a> was my account that was shadowbanned, you can see the final postings of mine in <a href="/r/isrconspiracyracist">/r/isrconspiracyracist</a>, I reported his abusive behaviour to the Admins using the report process and asked for his subs to be banned after he wouldn&#39;t stop harassing me and other <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> users.  I have to assume he is working with the Admins at this point, and that they don&#39;t want <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> here, because I was shadowbanned after reporting his violations of the terms of service.</p>

<p>This all started because <a href="/u/duckvimes_">/u/duckvimes_</a> was mad at me because I called him out for defending the practice of New York Rabbis sucking on baby penises, giving them genital herpes, and it leading to their death, as part of a legally allowed (in the US) modern day barbaric circumcision ritual (<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2304793/Two-babies-stricken-HERPES-ritual-oral-blood-sucking-circumcision-New-York-City.html">yes, this really happens)</a>   Since then, he has been trolling my comment history, looking for things I have said to submit to his hate subs, and then using his subs and their users to harass me.</p>

<p>If you are a victim of this guy&#39;s harassment, I suggest you take steps to 1.  Document the occurence with screenshots of before/after vote counts with timestamps so you can submit them to the Mods for violation of Reddit&#39;s terms of service.  2.  Make sure you can&#39;t be identified on Reddit.  Scrub your posts of identifying information, and use a VPN.  3.  Realize that the Admins don&#39;t care about certain types of harassment, if it goes along with the party agenda it is allowed, so consider leaving for greener pastures.  </p>

<p>EDIT:  As expected, this post was linked to in <a href="/r/topmindsofreddit">/r/topmindsofreddit</a>:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.np.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/39qcpz/was_just_shadowbanned_frosic_calling_out/">https://www.np.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/39qcpz/was_just_shadowbanned_frosic_calling_out/</a></p>

<p>When will the Reddit Admins step up and do something about <a href="/u/duckvimes_">/u/duckvimes_</a> and his army of trolls?</p>

<hr/>

<p>Edit: I know it would be a real PITA for a mod to babysit this thread and to go through and keep approving comment by comment, so many of my comments here will only be seen in my user history. Rest assured, I&#39;ve responded to most of you.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Edit in response <a href="/u/ramblinrambo3">/u/ramblinrambo3</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Did you OP ever get a response form the admins?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Admin Response was Deafening Silence. I also sent them a second message asking them to explain why I was shadowbanned while <a href="/u/duckvimes_">/u/duckvimes_</a> and his subs were not. I can explain why I was shadowbanned, but I can&#39;t explain why <a href="/u/duckvimes_">/u/duckvimes_</a> is allowed to continue harassing us. I created another account to continue my discussion with <a href="/u/duckvimes_">/u/duckvimes_</a> ABOUT ME, after he posted ABOUT ME, after he banned me from his precious sub <a href="/r/isrconspiracyracist">/r/isrconspiracyracist</a>. </p>

<p>Order of events: He and his trolls continually trolled my comment history, harassed me, were total dicks to me, and I called them out for it, I reported them to the Admins, then <a href="/u/duckvimes_">/u/duckvimes_</a> or another mod in his sub banned me, I created another account to continue the discussion ABOUT ME, and I was shadowbanned by the Admins for creating a second account to continue a discussion ABOUT ME.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s very weird to me that this kind of thing resulted in DEATH.</p>

<p>Death.  As in, those parents took that healthy child of theirs to their local religious nutjob and he sucked on their junk and they died, kind of dead.  They LOST their child.  Brand spanking new kiddo!  Fucking dead!  </p>

<p>OK, sorry for the nutjob comment and religious stuff but......fuck that bullshit.  Just my opinion obviously.</p>

<p>David, I don&#39;t want to make assumptions here based on your username but are you Jewish?  If so, can you give me some more of your opinion on this or other &quot;weird Jewish rituals&quot;?</p>

<p>If you have the time, could you then also comment on the current state of Israel and their actions against people/places/things?  Maybe just a &quot;for&quot; or &quot;against&quot; kind of thought?  I just like to get as many opinions of that subject as possible.  Especially from Jewish people.</p>

<p>If not, never mind and have a good &#39;er.</p>

You created a sub about being &quot;transracial&quot; in order to troll the Transgender community. You also seem to have an extreme distaste for Jewish people. While I don&#39;t agree with a lot of what you say and do, I can at least respect your right to say it. You should understand though, that what you put out there will get a response, and learn to accept the criticism of others even if it hurts your feelings. Hell I totally agree that circumcision rituals are barbaric and terrible. Honestly though, there are better ways to share that opinion along with others that won&#39;t make you come across like such an asshole(note, I&#39;m not calling you an asshole, I&#39;m describing how your behavior comes across. So before you claim I&#39;m harassing you please understand that difference. Also, I&#39;m in no way shape or form that guy who keeps trolling you).</p>

<p>Uh, yeah you are. You&#39;re calling him an asshole and an &quot;anti-semite&quot; -- you&#39;re just being passive-aggressive about it.</p>

<p>Hell I totally defend your right to call people names, but, you know, it just makes you <em>seem</em> like a dick. Now, I&#39;m not calling you a dick, I&#39;m just saying, I could totally understand how <em>other people</em> might think that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See - you&#39;re calling the good guys the bad guys and that&#39;s why you get called out. The SPLC exposes EVIL PEOPLE. Hint: if you&#39;re on their hit-list, you have evil, hateful views. &quot;Men&#39;s Rights&quot; is a misogynistic group that imagines they&#39;re oppressed as  reason to hate women. If you go to their group, every post is about attacking women. You don&#39;t go to the NAACP and see a wall of text about the evils of white people, do you?</p>

<p>The link you use to support your claim is itself an evil, disreputable and fringe organization. </p>

<p>From Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Social Contract Press (SCP) is an American publisher. It is a 
proponent of immigration reduction and population control, with an 
emphasis on issues such as culture and the environment. It was founded 
by John Tanton and is headed by Wayne Lutton, who in 2001 joined the 
editorial advisory board of the newspaper of the Council of Conservative 
Citizens (CCC).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note: the CCC is a <strong>white separatist organization</strong>.</p>

<p>Wikipedia continues:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It reprinted Jean Raspail&#39;s 1973 novel The Camp of the Saints, which was 
a best-seller in France when first published, and had originally been 
published in translated English form by Scribners. Due in part to the SCP&#39;s 
publication and endorsement of the novel, it has been described as a 
&quot;hate group&quot; which &quot;publishes a number of racist works&quot; by the Southern 
Poverty Law Center.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note: the book in question &quot;depicts a hypothetical setting whereby Third World mass immigration to France and the West leads to the destruction of Western civilization&quot;. It&#39;s a favorite among racists much like The Turner Diaries is </p>

<p>Wikipedia continues:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In response, the Social Contract Press devoted its Spring 2010 issue 
criticizing the SPLC, calling them &quot;profiteers of hate&quot;. Tanton has &gt;responded to the SPLC&#39;s characterization by saying that the SCP simply 
felt that the controversial novel should be available for those interested to 
read. The SPLC counters that those interested to read the novel tend to 
be American white supremacists.</p>

<p>Roxanne Lynn Doty wrote that their website included links to VDARE, FAIR, 
Numbers USA, the Center for Immigration Studies, American Renaissance 
and other groups. As of September 2013 these groups were still on their 
website, with the caveat &quot; Listing a link does not imply endorsement of 
past, present or future material posted to that website.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In summary: you claim you&#39;re a poor victim of evil harassment. You and your defenders object that you&#39;re perfectly decent people and victims. And yet,</p>

<p>1) You cite a misogynistic subreddit and link to a website run by a white supremacist to defend your position,</p>

<p>2) You call the good guys the hatemongers and cite a website run by white supremacists to defend this position,</p>

<p>3) You are so lost in your delusion that you don&#39;t realize that normal people will find your sources noxious and odious and honestly expected them to be well-received.</p>

<p>Pro tip: Take a look at WHY you&#39;re being ridiculed. It&#39;s a wake-up call to realize you&#39;re in the fever grip of some sick and twisted ideologies. Listen to <a href="/r/topmindsofreddit">/r/topmindsofreddit</a> and change your life and you&#39;ll feel better about yourself and others will feel better about you.</p>

<p>If I may interject -- I&#39;m not a white nationalist or separatist (although I support indigenous rights movements everywhere, including Europe), but I need to point out that the SPLC is not opposed to Jewish separatism (i.e. Zionism). That seems inconsistent to me.</p>

<p>In my experience, they, like <a href="https://archive.org/details/TheUglyTruthAboutTheAdl_217">the ADL (a wing of the Israel lobby)</a>, play fast and loose with information, and far too often unnecessarily pull the trigger on labeling people and groups as &quot;racist&quot;, &quot;extremist&quot;, or &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;.

<p>And, of course, the people who think that are those who generally <strong>are</strong> extremists and racists. Loook at the reply you got: &quot;It&#39;s pretty clear who runs it and why.&quot; </p>

<p>And there&#39;s the dangerous mindset that runs through this sub (and didn&#39;t run through conspiracy culture in the good old days): there are two kinds of people - those who agree with you and those who are too dumb or too paid-off to agree with you. </p>

<p>Think about it: you&#39;re suggesting 99.9% of the human population is either naive or in league against you. Per Sagan&#39;s notion of the &quot;extraordinary claim&quot;, isn&#39;t it more likely that you&#39;re the one in the wrong and need some significant evidence to persuade people otherwise?</p>

<p>Which group do you think is unfairly labelled a hate group? You never cited any facts that could be checked, but suggested everyone who disagreed was naive or a shill.</p>

<p>Er, and how does that reply show he&#39;s a racist or an extremist? It&#39;s painfully obvious to critical observers that the ADL is a lobbying/PR/espionage agency of the Israeli establishment. Perhaps you&#39;re unfamiliar with <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3a8g93/declassified_documents_about_the_israel_lobby_the/">the ADL&#39;s history</a>.</p>

<p>[By the way, to be &quot;aligned with&quot; the ADL&#39;s agendas =/= to be a paid shill, although obviously such people <em>are</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasbara">employed and recruited by the wider Israeli PR network</a>. Rather, I&#39;m talking about political, ideological, philosophical, and/or ethnocentric alignment -- i.e. those who identify with, sympathize with, or otherwise support their agendas, often through uncritical assimilation of their PR output.] </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the worldview is praising redneck Nazi things, then it really is ok, isn&#39;t it? It&#39;s not harassing someone to label them what they really are.

<p>This sub up-votes this stuff though. 194 up-votes at the moment, and I can dig up a lot more.

    <div class="md"><p>Do I support the right of a moderator to disallow hate speech on his subreddit? Yes, I do. </p>

<p>See, this is what you people don&#39;t understand - <strong>No one is censoring you.</strong> You have this entire platform - that is, Reddit, - to say whatever kind of silly bullshit you want. But your right does not supersede the rights of other people to criticize you. The same right that ensures your freedom to express your conspiracy theories also ensures that a moderator, if he/she deems your speech to be outside of the bounds they set for their subreddit, to remove said speech. That is not censorship, it&#39;s moderation. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t get to run around saying stupid things and not be criticized for it. Free speech works both ways. Usually when somebody like me comes and challenges you people on your home turf for saying some thing we think is stupid or racist we get unceremoniously banned, yet I never see you people stand up for any of us. Why do you think subs like <a href="/r/isconspiracyracist">/r/isconspiracyracist</a> exist in the first place? <em>Because you people ban everyone who tries to talk about it in r/conspiracy.</em></p>

<p>So don&#39;t give me this malarkey that you think you&#39;re being oppressed because somebody made fun of you for saying something racist. No one is oppressing you. </p>

 myself to making personal attacks on the Internet however, because I feel people with integrity can defend their ideals without resorting to such childishness.

    <div class="md"><p>Questions are fine, but that&#39;s not your disingenuous intent. Attempting to demonstrate this place in a negative light, conflating those who discuss what Zionist policy has done with racism. The fact that Zionists control Israel and a Jewish population is of no matter, as Zionism is separate from the true national identity of israeli&#39;s. Just as Hamas is separate from palestinians. It is an ideology. </p>

<p>It&#39;s sad how often others jump to asinine notions and cling to their misconceptions. </p>
