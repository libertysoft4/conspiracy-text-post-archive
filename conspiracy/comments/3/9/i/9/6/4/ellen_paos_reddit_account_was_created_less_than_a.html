        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In the wake of all the recent mess that&#39;s been going on, I was curious about how long Ellen Pao had actually been around on reddit. I have been here over 5 years, and I don&#39;t even consider myself a senior member. I joined right before the Digg v4.0 exodus.</p>

<p>I found that her account is 2 years old. She is massively under qualified to be CEO of a reddit that she has only even been a member of for a fraction of the time that a large portion of its users have.</p>

<p>Looking for something to gauge this by, I wondered if she&#39;d even been here since before Aaron Swartz died.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.redditcakeday.com/index.php?username=ekjp">/u/ekjp was created on Jan. 6, 2013</a></p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz">Aaron Swartz committed suicide on Jan. 11, 2013</a></p>

<p>Coupled with the fact that about a year prior, Aaron Swartz and reddit were a huge factor in the success of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protests_against_SOPA_and_PIPA">protests against governmental attempts at gaining control of the internet</a></p>

<p>This isn&#39;t about body shaming. It isn&#39;t about sexism, or homophobia, or stopping piracy, or child porn.</p>

<p>All of this is 100% about gaining control of the internet.</p>

<p>All of Pao&#39;s history shows that she is not at all to be trusted. Ponzi schemes, frivolous yet massive lawsuits.</p>

<p>Events like what has been happening in the past 24 hours here don&#39;t happen on accident. They are planned years in advance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The guy was suicided or at least driven to a no-touch-suicide by coming down on him with the judicial hammer for a petty &quot;crime&quot; on an MIT honey pot network so grossly under-protected it just had to be a set up.</p>

<p>&quot;The arrogant government prosecutors who, in effect, murdered Aaron, as well as the irresponsible academics who shrugged their shoulders in indifference and the various media outlets that casually reported on his arrest, should think carefully about the lack of proportion in the American criminal justice system, and the devastating impact it can have on real lives.</p>

<p>Authorities in New York have undertaken a similarly disproportionate assault on Internet freedom and academic whistle-blowing, arresting and prosecuting a blogger who sent out “Gmail confessions” in which a well-known New York University department chairman appeared to be eccentrically accusing himself of plagiarism. Again, there appears to be nothing but silence from the relevant communities.&quot;</p>

<p>Pao is the equivalent of a cointelpro plant. Her job was to hijack the brainchild and turn it into the exact opposite of what it was meant to be ... Assuring Swartz wouldn&#39;t be yet another renegade who got away with challenging the establishment succesfully and peacefully. </p>

<p>I took that screen clip last night after seeing my whole front page melt in this miasma of Fattening commentary. I&#39;ve never seen the gold goal meter go higher than 105% in my time here. And with the apparent outrage over the bannings, why would it even top 75%?</p>

<p>Either the admins dropped the goal to inflate the percentage, or they are pouring money in to to accomplish the same goal... Or last night marks the beginning of an influx of SJWs to the internet&#39;s newest hug-box.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They don&#39;t want you to be able to say anything anonymously, because if you are anonymous, then they can&#39;t punish you for what you say, they can&#39;t impose consequences to control your speech. They can&#39;t control the narrative; and power comes only from the gun (which they also want to take away) and control of the narrative.</p>

<p>If politicians and media cannot control the narrative and cannot control the guns, then they have no power.</p>

<p>Consider this recent quote from career narrative controller, Bob Schieffer, bemoaning the current state of the nation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We now don’t know where people get their news, but what we do know is they’re bombarded with information 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Most of the information is wrong and some of it is wrong on purpose,” Schieffer said. “It is our job, I think, in mainstream journalism to try to cut through this mall of information and tell people what we think is relevant in what they need to know. That is the job of the journalist and I have to say it’s harder and harder.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://washington.cbslocal.com/2015/05/29/schieffer-we-now-dont-know-where-people-get-their-news/">http://washington.cbslocal.com/2015/05/29/schieffer-we-now-dont-know-where-people-get-their-news/</a></p>

<p>The whole system was based on the idea of controlling the news source, and controlling the opinions people could derive from that news source. Present the story, then present option A and option B to give people the illusion of choice to feel like they are forming their own opinions, thinking for themselves, being real free individuals, when in reality their possible choices were already chosen for them. The internet mucks all that up. The narrative can&#39;t be controlled anymore, except through these hugely controversial stories that are regularly put on megablast and follow the same formula: sex, perversion, death, hate, and fear.</p>

<p>The next big policy change for reddit will be the end of anonymity. The powers that be want reddit and anything like it destroyed, or at least made impotent. It will be very difficult to ever again attract this number of users to one platform.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been there man.  I felt the same about Obama right after Bush 2.0.  Only took me about 3 months to realize we had been completely duped, and all of his pleasant sounding rhetoric was a ruse to get into office.</p>

<p>At this point I&#39;m of the mindset that you can only trust 3rd parties after doing your research on the particular candidate you like.  Personally I&#39;m excited to see how Rand does/gets treated as I am an idealist when it comes to him, and have a feeling he is just wearing the wool of a political sheep to get into office before he reveals himself to be a completely Libertarian Wolf and going on a political warpath through the corrupt and the evil.</p>

<p>But I&#39;m probably not going to be voting for him.  He&#39;s been very sketchy recently</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know where to go.  There is so much blame to go around in the media and government officials, but also the apathy of the people.  I know that I can rally behind the ideal of taking corporate money out of politics, no Super-PACs.  A corporations interest is to its shareholders, not the country it happens to be based in; and that&#39;s not something I feel, it&#39;s a fact.  That alone should give people pause before they start to back the legality or righteousness of this subject.  I believe once people stop getting rich (not stupid-rich, just wealthy) from being in office, it may just go a good ways to enlisting superior people for the jobs.<br/>
Pipe dream?  Probably :(</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would be certainly more nefarious if he was murdered. To me it seems he probably wasn&#39;t, but it&#39;s still flat-out evil the criminal pressure that the prosecutors applied. The threat of decades in prison at the mercy of a judge or jury against a prosecutor who is hell-bent on unreasonable penalties is cruel and crushing to almost anyone. JSTOR didn&#39;t support the extreme charges. But even if they did, and he had destroyed JSTOR&#39;s business, the potential punishment was ludicrous. No doubt he played with fire, but his life was most likely snuffed out by heinously over-reaching criminal prosecution. If he&#39;d survived, and felt obligated, he could have easily paid any damages via further innovative business ventures. Facing the charges he was against, the possibility to atone, or even contribute to society, must have seemed bleak to him. I&#39;m not saying I know that he wasn&#39;t murdered (I doubt it) or even that the suicide was 100% caused by the prosecuting attorney. But it&#39;s easy to see how the suicide was incited or accelerated by the prosecution team AND anyone who had little to lose but didn&#39;t speak out against the charges: plenty of comfortable MIT faculty and staff in the latter group.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The degree of &#39;nefariousness&#39; is one of those media ploys to get us onto a hamster wheel. It makes no major difference how much of a direct role the needed to take. All that matters is that the job got done, now we&#39;re currently enjoying the fruits of their handiwork. The fact is that someone was snuffed out so that reddit could become co-opted or destroyed. Clearly that&#39;s where things stand right now. Do we have all the proof? No but we&#39;re also not prosecuting these people. We&#39;re learning how they operate. The information we&#39;ve seen is enough for us to tentatively assume that he was targeted. The more reddit starts broadening its use of censorship and starts acting like the government, the more likely this hypothesis is correct. </p>

<p>But then in the end it turns out he wasn&#39;t in the Batmobile because when Alfred visits a cafe in Florence (Which Bruce visites multiple times in the past), he sees Batman sitting at a different table, thus proving that he didn&#39;t commit suicide in the end.</p>
