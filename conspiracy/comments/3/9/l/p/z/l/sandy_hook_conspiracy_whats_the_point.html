I&#39;m not one who could typically be described as a conspiracy theorist but I&#39;m certainly distrustful of the government and know that not everything is as it seems. </p>

<p>The purpose of this post is to ascertain why people think the massacre is in some way a conspiracy. What would be the purpose of the US government staging or faking a school shooting? We&#39;ve not seen a serious attack on the second amendment since then and I&#39;ve never heard a good explanation of the theory. </p>

<p>Hopefully this post isn&#39;t removed because I genuinely don&#39;t understand the &quot;conspiracy&quot; angle of the incident.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand why you&#39;re not &quot;getting it&quot;.  You&#39;re expecting some sort of major push to take away our guns.  It&#39;s not going to go down like that, because most people would flip out if the government tried to take everyone&#39;s guns.  So, to take our guns, they will need a populace that doesn&#39;t even want guns.  The current populace likes guns, so changing them would be next to impossible.  The kids, in the other hand, can be changed.</p>

<p>Which is why they needed an operation like Sandy Hook.  See, they&#39;re not targeting you, which is why your typical adult either dismisses this confusion as the acts of insanity, or sees this as some sort of scam.  Their target is your children, whom they want to condition in several ways.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>After Sandy Hook, millions of dollars are being pooled into security companies to install cameras and guards in every school.  &quot;Parents&quot; of alleged slain children are teaming up with different security companies and collecting donations, which almost all are going to these companies so they can lobby and expand their influence.  The idea is to get every child so used to being under constant surveillance, that they actually start to enjoy it.  They will reinforce this by constantly telling them that this is all for their protection.</p></li>
<li><p>Now that schools have adopted a &quot;zero tolerance&quot; policy, they are giving ridiculous punishments to children for having anything to do with guns.  A kid gets expelled for twirling his pencil &quot;like a gun&quot;.  A kid gets suspended for biting his poptart in a manner that just happens to make it look somewhat like a gun.  This is all being done on purpose to make an example of that child so all the other children start to think guns = bad.</p></li>
<li><p>More and more schools are adding one or more psychologists to their payrolls.  They claim this is to help &quot;troubled students in order to prevent something like this happening again&quot;, but the truth is these people are simply drug dealers.  If any child shows any sign of not fully accepting and/or complying with the new system, that child will be sent to school&#39;s shrink, who will undoubtedly say that kid needs medication.  If, as a parent, you disagree, they will take your kid away.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So, you see, the gun factor is really only a small part of it.  This wasn&#39;t an attack on your guns.  This was an attack on your children by the powers that be, hidden as an attack on your children by the people.  It&#39;s a classic false flag.</p>

<p>They want us all so scared of each other that we will let them instill all these measures to &quot;protect us&quot;, when the truth is they only want to protect themselves from us.</p>

<p>So, what&#39;s the next step?  Where&#39;s this all heading?  Well, the Obama administration actually talked about it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/culture/education/item/20905-obama-s-education-secretary-touts-government-boarding-schools">http://www.thenewamerican.com/culture/education/item/20905-obama-s-education-secretary-touts-government-boarding-schools</a></p>

<p>That&#39;s right, public boarding schools.  If they accomplish making this nationwide, they will successfully have destroyed the family unit.  They will raise the children into the type of adults they want; sociopaths that are too busy attacking each other, and too ignorant to be able to imagine that there might just be a better way.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a truly disturbing thought but playing the long game is essential in social engineering. Previous to this I honestly didn&#39;t anticipate seeing any argument that would sway my opinion but this is the post to do it. </p>

<p>I had always considered the ridiculous zero tolerance policies in schools but at a certain point it just can&#39;t be coincidence anymore. As we know now, Himmler considered the Holocaust to be a &quot;silent crusade&quot; that the world would never know of. I am truly shaken that the federal government could be capable of such an act. </p>

<p>Are you kidding me?   </p>

<p>Before the bodies <em>(that were never shown)</em> were removed from the crime scene <em>(that was never shown)</em> all media, various elected officials, and various other &quot;grass roots&quot; organizations were literally throwing temper tantrums to pass new laws ...... <strong>THAT WOULD NOT HAVE EVEN PREVENTED THE EVENTS of Sandy Hook even if they were laws at the time</strong>. </p>

<p>History shows us when totalitarian regimes cement their power they do so with a show of force. Assuming the plutocrats in charge wanted our firearms why not simply take them? Of course they risk igniting a civil war but what change ever comes without cost?   Hell, if they are willing to kill children I can&#39;t imagine they&#39;d shy away from some violence. </p>

<p>Just because it didn&#39;t succeed doesn&#39;t mean there wasn&#39;t a conspiracy to force the abolition of the Second Amendment.  History is replete with failed conspiracies, and plots against a domestic population.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Business Plot</strong> was an alleged political conspiracy in 1933 in the United States. Retired Marine Corps Major General Smedley Butler claimed that wealthy businessmen were plotting to create a fascist veterans&#39; organization and use it in a coup d&#39;état to overthrow President of the United States Franklin D. Roosevelt, with Butler as leader of that organization. In 1934, Butler testified before the United States House of Representatives Special Committee on Un-American Activities (the &quot;McCormack-Dickstein Committee&quot;) on these claims.[1] No one was prosecuted.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>I knew of the business plot before actually. I have no doubt in my mind that there are very powerful forces in this world who want to establish a bare faced plutocracy. One where our rights are non existent and they can treat the lower class as true slaves. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that it&#39;s impossible that there was a plot to restrict gun rights but, why risk such an operation that was such a failure? There have been a rash of school shootings lately anyway. I just feel like they could have had a far more effective attack on the public. </p>

<p>Look at how effective 9/11 was. Why operate on such a small scale? Look at the most effective conspiracies: JFK assassination, 9/11, and the sponsorship of Al Qaeda and the armament of ISIS. The conspiracies that truly succeed are on the largest of scales. </p>

<p>Crime scene photos are not typically released to the public before any investigation is complete.  </p>

<p>Also, crime scene photos are generally not released after investigation and ensuing trial is completed because rights of publicity may exceed a person&#39;s death regardless of conspiracy theories about it.  </p>

<p>Additionally, victims&#39; surviving relatives also have valid privacy concerns.</p>

<p>Really?   </p>

<ul>
<li>The internal security camera,and other external footage of the Columbine Shootings wasn&#39;t instantly released?</li>
<li>The falling bodies from the WTC Towers were not repeatedly broadcast?</li>
<li>The post 9-11-2001 beheadings were not instantly released and repeatedly broadcast?  Daniel Pearl&#39;s throat being slashed alone was broadcasted for weeks.</li>
</ul>

<p>I mean we can literally go on for days with examples of the most gruesome videos, and images are chain broadcast for a deliberate effect.  Now ask yourself why that same media would all voluntarily censor all U.S. military members coffins from being broadcasted as they removed from planes returning from Iraq/Afghanistan.</p>

<p>No, the security camera footage was released years later. The other instances you refer to are of the media broadcasting footage they obtained themselves, not a government agency &quot;releasing&quot; footage. Do you understand the difference?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Obviously, keeping the media out of a school building is vastly easier than keeping them out of the airspace and streets around huge buildings that have collapsed.</p>

<p>Furthermore, crime scene pictures of dead bodies from the massacre at the Aurora movie theater have not been released by the police.  Surveillance video from that shooting was withheld from the public until some was shown at recent court proceedings.  Also, crime scene photos with dead bodies have not been released by authorities for the Wisconsin Sikh temple shooting.  </p>

<p>So release of crime scene photos before investigation is complete is not something to be expected just because cameras constantly rolled for the mass casualty event at WTC on 9/11.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never heard a good explanation of the many mystifying Sandy Hook anomalies.  Neither the (federal, state, or local) government nor the media did a good enough job to avoid mass awareness of either an in-your-face incompetence or what you suggest would be a pointless conspiracy.  But, when I was hanging on every word and unaware of anomalies, Obama&#39;s comment that &quot;...we&#39;re not going to tolerate this anymore&quot; blew my mind so bad I said to a friend that Obama shouldn&#39;t include folks who are not homicidal claiming they&#39;re tolerating schoolhouse murders and maybe he tolerates that kind of stuff but nobody else does except Death Row types and presidents.  I won&#39;t go further with subsequent anomalies, but as a regular citizen, Obama&#39;s use of first person plural was never more offensive.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Are we any closer to the total abolition of the 2nd amendment?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just because it didn&#39;t succeed doesn&#39;t mean there wasn&#39;t a conspiracy to force the abolition of the Second Amendment.  History is replete with failed conspiracies, and plots against a domestic population.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Business Plot</strong> was an alleged political conspiracy in 1933 in the United States. Retired Marine Corps Major General Smedley Butler claimed that wealthy businessmen were plotting to create a fascist veterans&#39; organization and use it in a coup d&#39;état to overthrow President of the United States Franklin D. Roosevelt, with Butler as leader of that organization. In 1934, Butler testified before the United States House of Representatives Special Committee on Un-American Activities (the &quot;McCormack-Dickstein Committee&quot;) on these claims.[1] No one was prosecuted.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Crime scene photos are not released to the public before any investigation is complete.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Really?   </p>

<ul>
<li>The internal security camera,and other external footage of the Columbine Shootings wasn&#39;t instantly released?</li>
<li>The falling bodies from the WTC Towers were not repeatedly broadcast?</li>
<li>The post 9-11-2001 beheadings were not instantly released and repeatedly broadcast?  Daniel Pearl&#39;s throat being slashed alone was broadcasted for weeks.</li>
</ul>

<p>I mean we can literally go on for days with examples of the most gruesome videos, and images are chain broadcast for a deliberate effect.  Now ask yourself why that same media would all voluntarily censor all U.S. military members coffins from being broadcasted as they removed from planes returning from Iraq/Afghanistan.</p>

<p>Holy shit.  Ohio repealed the NFA and is now allowing purchase of actual assault rifles?  How did that fly under the radar.  I&#39;m still stuck here with my semi-automatic weapons.</p>
