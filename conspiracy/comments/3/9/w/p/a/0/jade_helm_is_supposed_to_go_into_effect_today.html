<p>For those who didn&#39;t know what Jade Helm 15 is, <a href="http://american3rdposition.com/wp-content/uploads/Jade-Helm-Martial-Law-WW3-Prep-Document-1.pdf">here</a> is the manual presented to local governmental leaders explaining some of what will be going on. The manual says it will start July 15th, but I have read a significant number of other sources stating that it will start today, a month early. I posted 6 additional sources on some user&#39;s comment to &quot;Put them here.&quot; so just look for a snide comment and follow the thread down.</p>

<p>-edit 2- </p>

<p>I just noticed, the contact numbers all have 910 area codes, which are New Hanover County, NC.</p>

<p>-edit 3-</p>

<p>A user posted wondering if this deal to boost military cooperation between the <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2015-06/15/content_21001723.htm">US and China</a>, that was signed today, has anything to do with Jade Helm. I don&#39;t know, but the timing is quite interesting.</p>

<p>-edit 4-</p>

<p>Apparently the <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/markets/2015/06/15/stocks-monday/71243560/">Greece debt talks</a> didn&#39;t go anywhere, and now stocks are falling globally. Probably unrelated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was in the Coast Guard from 2003 on. RIMPAC wasn&#39;t a big deal. It had more external agencies cooperating, but at just over 18,000 individuals participating, and not on mainland America, it was really nothing. </p>

<p>1200 &#39;service members&#39; are supposed to be in compact areas of Texas alone. That doesn&#39;t account for the civilian and other agencies involved in one single area. Add to that the fact that hard figures of participants, with some even being considered clandestine or hostile, are non existent, and we don&#39;t have a solid figure with Jade Helm. </p>

<p>Another point is that there are an extraordinary number of law enforcement agencies involved here, and this is all taking place on mainland soil, with certain entire states being considered hostile. Just look at the PDF that was released: there are insurgent and compliant states, with others leaning one way or the other on the peripheral, and pockets of insurgent groups within compliant states. This can only be training for how to deal with Americans on American soil. The PDF even states that the training is to give participants the knowledge of how to fight in new, urban areas. I mean, come on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So? If there&#39;s a large scale civil disturbance, preparation and coordination are required to minimize loss of life. The current government wouldn&#39;t just roll over in the case of a civil war 2 and being prepared is what the military is all about. The fact that this large scale of coordination hasn&#39;t happened yet is surprising. There are all kinds of disaster drills that don&#39;t require the same level of response as a civil war would and with all of the rioting and unrest that&#39;s been happening lately, it makes sense to have a plan in place that can be executed quickly, especially if things go wrong quickly. What happens if a cartel/terrorist organization gets a hold in the US? Territories get taken over and have to be deemed hostile. This isn&#39;t about fighting Americans, it&#39;s about being prepared to fight enemies, foreign and domestic. As a member of the military, you should know better than to stir the pot when you don&#39;t have all the facts instead of contributing to the overall level of panic and paranoia. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m confused. Where is it confirmed it&#39;s starting a month early? That &#39;concerned citizen&#39; just gave a statement with no source, and the screenshot said that emergency drill for police, fire, and medical was yesterday at 6:00PM. I don&#39;t see anything in the link that explicitly states it&#39;s starting today </p>

<p>Edit: I did some digging, I just see a lot of blogs making claims of this with nothing substantial. Also, looked into the EMP and nothing really jumps out to me as conclusive...</p>

<p>You are just making stuff up and believing it as you type it. No Proof of anything you said is going to happen. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Martial Law was declared in Boston.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No it was not declared in Boston. I don&#39;t even think you know what Martial Law even means when you say stuff like that.</p>

<p>What was declared in Boston was called &quot;Shelter in Place&quot; which is 100% voluntary. </p>

<p>Martial Law is the imposition of the highest-ranking military officer as the military governor or as the head of the government, thus removing all power from the previous executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government. </p>

<p>No, but you your previous comment mentioned no such thing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The whole point of exercises is to prepare for real events and situations that they think are probable.</p>

<p>Yeah like an Urban War overseas which is what the entire Jade Helm exercise is preparing for. NOT Martial Law.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hmm looking at Baltimore, I wonder why they would be worried about civil unrest.</p>

<p>The government is not using Jade Helm to prepare for civil unrest in the United States. </p>

<blockquote>

From what I witnessed with the lock down and amount of police, it looked like martial law. I don&#39;t think anything is going to happen in September and will agree that it is not a conspiracy. However, they always learn something and the tactics they practice be applied domestically and internationally. Flexibility is a good thing. I don&#39;t know USASOC purpose with Jade Helm and I guess most domestic military operations or exercises could be seen as threatening to some.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for clarifying your beliefs. 
While distrust in government can be healthy at times, seeing domestic military exercises in this matter is nothing novel or new. 
Some people take their distrust to dark places and confirmation bias 
and echo chamber discussions do nothing to ease the distrust.</p>

<p>This exercise has been blown way out of proportion by the conspiracy theory crowd, and wild accusations and claims run rampant. </p>

<p>I can only hope the credibility of those who are certain Martial Law will happen via Jade Helm, receive the tarnished reputations they deserve. </p>

<p>It&#39;s your exact attitude towards any Gov action based on your responses of late. &quot;Well the US didn&#39;t turn into <em>1984</em> in the first 24 hours so it&#39;s all bullshit&quot;. That is very limited thinking. You are completely unwilling to even entertain thoughts about it because you think it&#39;s so absolutely batshit crazy of a claim, when in fact, it&#39;s not at all. Every single ruling body and government in history has been corrupt on some level. Humans abuse power. Calling people idiots for thinking about it and discussing it is absolutely useless and only serves your Ego.</p>

Being that close to a military base, I&#39;ve seen some motion before in the previous years. But in the past month or two, I&#39;ve been seeing convoy after convoy come through the entire Southern Colorado region. I travel through the southern area of the state a lot and about a week ago, I saw this really long convoy pulled over on the side of the highway and they were all patrolling (?) the grounds near the highway. </p>

<p>I see them almost every day now, and it makes me wonder what&#39;s really happening, because something is changing. We wouldn&#39;t be seeing all of this military activity for no reason. Through this thread, some rather interesting light has been shed... </p>

which is very intriguing being that with the &#39;shooting&#39; in TN then they decide to arm national guardsmen in that state along with Florida, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Arkansas...etc ohhhh the irony i guess right? lol</p>

<p>sooo ummm yesss not in EVERY STATE but yes THAT STATE did allow it! sooo maybe before putting your two cents in you should have fact checked yourself. lol yeah its a constitutional right but please tell me the last time our gov has followed the constitution because just during obamas term it&#39;s been violated hundreds of times!!!!....... <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2013/12/23/president-obamas-top-10-constitutional-violations-of-2013/">http://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2013/12/23/president-obamas-top-10-constitutional-violations-of-2013/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>That story links naturalnews, and a broken link as sources.
It does not say cops have the right to enter your home without a warrant,
what it says is that people don&#39;t have the &quot;right&quot; to resist their possibly illegal attempts to enter the home, and only have the &quot;right&quot; to protest it in a court of law, later. Which is still bullshit, IMHO.</p>

<p>It&#39;s safe to say the 4th amendment trumps the Indiana supreme court.
Ultimately YOU decide who you let invade your home, and people should
defend their constitutional rights, with violence, if necessary, but for god
sake if you do, make sure you are in the right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m in NC and live next to an airpark that&#39;s back in the woods a bit, but only a mile and a halfs walk from my house. We frequently see hot air balloons, prop planes, farming planes, and people&#39;s personal hobby/antique planes. </p>

<p>Recently it&#39;s been all helicopters (some are the double rotor ones that look super badass, and can be used to move tanks and houses) and small military craft. The run way isn&#39;t long enough for a commercial sized airliner, so I haven&#39;t seen any cargo craft, other than the massive choppers. There have been black hawk-looking helicopters too. </p>

<p>From what I&#39;m hearing, there is increased military traffic all over. If somebody <em>was</em> up to something, it could be a classic slight of hand move, so while everyone is watching the west coast, something happens on the east coast. Then, when attention is on the east coast, the personnel already in place back on the west coast could make a move, effecting a pincer attack/whatever.</p>

<p>Just food for thought, if you like random speculation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not the guy you were originally replying to fyi, I just grew up in Michigan and felt like chiming in. So that delicious vitriol in the above post is a lil misguided</p>

<p>I kind of see where you&#39;re coming from, but Nevada and California are a bad example because the UP and Michigan are <em>the same state</em>. If you had used the same argument but had used SoCal and NorCal, I might have agreed with you and moved on.</p>

<p>Look back at my first post above. The only thing I&#39;m disagreeing with is that the UP and mainland are not &quot;entirely different geographic area of the country.&quot; Thats just bad semantics. I grew up there. <strong>A helicopter like people are discussing elsewhere in this thread could get from Marquette to Mt. Pleasant in ~2 hours, so for this argument your opinion that they are &quot;entirely different geographic area(s)&quot; is especially moot.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes they would. Its called predictive programing. They play a sick little gsme where they tell the truth about their plans through &quot;fictional&quot; movies and tv shows, then use the publics lack of resistance to said plans as consent. </p>

<p>In june or july of 2001 the pilot epidsode of &quot;the lone gunman&quot; (an x-files spin off) was about a plot to fly a airliner into the wtc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>???</p>

<p>But only a small amount of people even saw that ep of The Lone Gunman, and it&#39;s not likely they would have taken a fictional show as gospel truth to be riled up over enough to mount a &#39;resistance&#39;, so how could that have been taken as any kind of consent?</p>

<p>I agree that sometimes there seems to be a prophetic element that pops up in stories/movies/etc sometimes, but that could just be an aspect of the human collective consciousness picking up on certain things occasionally and expressing them in those stories.  Or it could be that whomever came up with the 9/11 plan was inspired by that episode.  idk.</p>

<p>Even if &#39;predictive programming&#39; were true in the way you mention, the fact that the majority of people on a constant and perpetual basis are desperately striving to live and to protect their children should overrule any supposed &#39;consent&#39; to a small specific plan that was only put forth to a very small amount of people.  There would be a larger mass of non-consent on general principle by the world population at large.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live in Ocala, Florida. 352 area code. We have 600-700 soldiers at one of the high schools (West Port High School). They have set up a military base. I counted probably 15-20 huge trucks that could carry 10-15 people. I saw maybe 10!humvees. And a multitude of very generic white vans. I just drove by 30 minutes ago and they were being very active. Multiple cars moving around. They had very few lights set up but it was around 245 when I drove by. Maybe I can get you guys some pictures when I drive by in the daytime. </p>

<p>I took these from inside of a car in a staff parking lot across the field from &quot;their&quot; parking lot. This is where I went to high school, it&#39;s a pretty big school, More than 2500 kids now. Every spot in that parking lot was filled with either one of the large trucks carrying the white trailer that says 
&quot;US ARMY RESERVE&quot;
&quot;HAZMAT&quot;
&quot;DECON&quot; 
On the side of them, or one of the really large cloth covered trucks that can carry many people. There were humvees lined up in the corner and I couldn&#39;t get a good angle on them. And there were a few sheds in some parking spots as well. </p>

<p>Also, for those who didn&#39;t see the article I included in my last post from a local news site acknowledging the military presence in the upwards of 600 personnel.

<p>I just read that article, and shit is it interesting. First off, the reporter wrote that the military <em>occupied</em> the town, not that they are performing training/etc. And upon looking up info on &quot;Operation Guardian,&quot; I found no specifics; only news articles that it will culminate on the 25th of June...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That story links naturalnews, and a broken link as sources.
It does not say cops have the right to enter your home without a warrant,
what it says is that people don&#39;t have the &quot;right&quot; to resist their possibly illegal attempts to enter the home, and only have the &quot;right&quot; to protest it in a court of law, later. Which is still bullshit, IMHO.</p>

<p>It&#39;s safe to say the 4th amendment trumps the Indiana supreme court.
Ultimately YOU decide who you let invade your home, and people should
defend their constitutional rights, with violence, if necessary, but for god
sake if you do, make sure you are in the right.</p>
