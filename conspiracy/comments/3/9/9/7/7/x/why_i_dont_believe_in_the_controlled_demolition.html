        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As a precursor, I&#39;m not denying the whole conspiracy, there is sketchy parts to it, but from my opinion, logic, and research, the controlled demo and no plane theory&#39;s are entirely false.</p>

<p>Now before you guys just downvote and blindly follow your theories, read what I said, and keep an open mind.
and before you guys cite your &quot;documentaries&quot; I would like you to watch 2 somewhat unrelated videos about media and documentaries.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07NMglQX6gE">TV tricks of the trade: Quotes and Cutaways</a></p>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>Controlled Demolition</strong>:
2 main reasons I don&#39;t believe this one.</p>

<p>Note: There has NEVER been a building the size of any of the WTC towers that has been demolished before, so we have nothing to compare it too, as the sample size is just the 3 towers.</p>

<p>First off, WTC 7 was entirely a steel structure, and while jet fuel/conventional fire cant melt steel, it can sure as hell weaken it because At about 550° C (1,000° F) Steel is at 50% Strength and at about 800° C (1472° F) structural steel loses 90% of its strength, shown by <a href="http://docs.engineeringtoolbox.com/documents/1353/temperature-strength-metals.png">This</a> graph. This is proof that fire CAN bring down a building</p>

<p>Secondly, It would takes months of on site planning, surveying, dozens of people, hundreds of charges, to bring down a building the size of WTC 7. While some people are inherently Evil, most arent, people cant keep secrets, its a fact. The watergate scandal was a small scandal, and got revealed, The NSA spying was revealed, CIA being sketchy as fuck was revealed, etc. People just cant keep secrets. Now If you honestly believe that the dozens of not hundreds of people were directly involved in placing charges then to be honest, your stupid as hell. No amount of money will keep a regular person from murdering 3000 people, The only way this would stay a secret would be if Bush himself put the charges. So the fact that NOT A SINGLE PERSON has come fore-ward with definitive evidence proving who they are, is enough proof to prove this part of the theory wrong.</p>

<p>As for the NIST investigations, it was Illogical to waste resources on this </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;And we found that even the smallest charge would release an extremely loud sound heard half a mile away.&quot; There were no reports of such a sound; numerous observers and video recordings found the collapse to be relatively quiet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did they follow standards? No. they had better things to investigate than all of your ridiculous theories</p>

<p><strong>No Planes Theory:</strong>
I was planning on adding sources on this part, but its a bit late so Il add them later if needed.</p>

<p>246 passengers died on those flights, so if there were no planes, where did the passengers go? Where did the pilots go? What happened to the planes, we knew they were on the radar and took off.</p>

<p>If it was a cruise missile, where did it come from?, How come no military personal saw it being shot? How come none of the hundreds of people on those bases questioned why cruise missiles were magically missing.</p>

<p><strong>Occam&#39;s Razor:</strong></p>

<p>Occam&#39;s Razor states that the easiest solution is often the best one, and this is the true &quot;smoking gun&quot; in this conspiracy. Think about it this way, why make up stories for about 250 people, fake radar signatures, plant hundreds of charges in all the buildings, make planes and cruise missiles vanish, make 250 people vanish,  convince hundreds the demolishers, Air traffic control towers, News stations and Investigators that it the terrorists, and still activity attempt to hide all this evidence, when all to invade iraq for oil when it would be 100000000x easier to lose 1 small nuclear warhead and detonate it. 300 person conspiracy vs 10 person conspiracy, and the latter supports the anti WMD message against Iraq.</p>

<p>if you really think about it, IT MAKES NO FUCKING SENSE TO DO ALL THAT WORK WHEN IT COULD BE DONE SO MUCH EASIER.</p>

<p>You guys are why no one trusts conspiracy theorists, you take anything that looks sketchy and shout CONSPIRACY! CONSPIRACY!
its disgusting, and you guys plague all true conspiracy theorists</p>

<p>and before we start with a link war, just because a few people who have some knowledge have said its fake, there are SO MANY MORE WHO HAVEN&#39;T, but they are all paid by the government too right?</p>

<p>/rant, downvote if you want</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, compartmentalization, plays a huge role. I&#39;m not saying that we had plain clothes dude in there, planting devices, could&#39;ve been wired from the start, which could explain the thermo-nuclear demo that, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAV_BUQoGBw">Dimitri Khalezov covers.</a>. This is all speculation, just trying to figure shit out. I was rocked by this, I was 12 when this happened. I&#39;m now 25 looking back and stuff is not adding up. Whether we we actively did it or just let it happened, idk. But something is off about this. I know about Northwoods and Gladio and wouldn&#39;t put it past them. They actively planned for this, I know the a bomb project is moot, but all of them kept their lips shut for a greater good, apply that to 9/11 and well.... You got tight lips and a tight ship along with drills and cover drills. Something isn&#39;t right....</p>

<p>On one occasion, when in New York City, I was in the night season called upon to behold buildings rising story after story toward heaven. These buildings were warranted to be fireproof, and they were erected to glorify the owners and builders. Higher and still higher these buildings rose, and in them the most costly material was used. . . .<br/>
The scene that next passed before me was an alarm of fire. Men looked at the lofty and supposedly fire-proof buildings and said: &quot;They are perfectly safe.&quot; But these buildings were consumed as if made of pitch. The fire engines could do nothing to stay the destruction. The firemen were unable to operate the engines.<br/>
<strong>written in 1901 --Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9, pp. 12, 13.</strong></p>

<p>But I have no light in particular in regard to what is coming on New York, only that I know that one day the great buildings there will be thrown down by the turning and overturning of God&#39;s power. From the light given me, I know that destruction is in the world. One word from the Lord, one touch of his mighty power, and these massive structures will fall. Scenes will take place the fearfulness of which we cannot imagine.<br/>

<p>First off, WTC 7 was entirely a steel structure, and while jet fuel/conventional fire cant melt steel, it can sure as hell weaken it because At about 550° C (1,000° F) Steel is at 50% Strength and at about 800° C (1472° F) structural steel loses 90% of its strength, shown by This graph. This is proof that fire CAN bring down a building  </p>

<p>&quot;On February 13, 1975, the WTC North Tower was beset by a fire, which &quot;burned at temperatures in excess of 700°C (1,292°F) for over three hours and spread over some 65 percent of the 11th floor, including the core, caused no serious structural damage to the steel structure. In particular, no trusses needed to be replaced.&quot;
