However, flooding this subreddit with semi-off-topic shitposts is only serving as a distraction from everything else that&#39;s going on that we might want to discuss. And, frankly, whatever message you&#39;re trying to convey at this point is being lost in the fecal flood, as it looks like many are just bitching for the sake of bitching. </p>

<p>There are 3 million topics about this issue on this subreddit. If you truly are concerned about the quality of content on this website, why not use one of those to express your disdain rather than create 3 million more?</p>

<p>Bullshit, he&#39;s the &quot;good cop&quot; in their classic &quot;good cop&quot; &quot;bad cop&quot; dichotomy.</p>

<p>Flytape is their black sheep.</p>

<p>This is why flytape did that insanely stupid official unofficial conspiracy podcast and turned that into a whole debacle.</p>

<p>To further confuse people and divide people and further shroud and obfuscate his nefariousness and deception by appearing to be just a genuine while slightly misguided at times person who &quot;truly cares&quot;.</p>

<p>I call BS, it reeks of Alex Jones style Controlled Opposition.</p>

<p>TL;DR - The team to subvert <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> was established at least 2 years ago, with merely the mention of certain members in said team resulting in potential bans.</p>

<p><a href="/u/postnationalism">/u/postnationalism</a> and <a href="/u/Indra-varuna">/u/Indra-varuna</a> are on this team in my opinion, as they always post the same content on a near daily basis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do I seriously have to list what agendas you know you both push?</p>

<p>How about animosity between police and citizens for one, as you both frequently post anti-police stories.</p>

<p>Now, granted, the police are a problem, and we need to massively reform not only the law enforcement organizations of this country, but also the laws which dictate what they must enforce, and how they are to enforce said laws.</p>

<p>The articles which you both post, are not so reasonable and well tempered, rather they further promote hatred of police from citizens, and encourage divisiveness where we should be seeking cooperative solutions.</p>

<p>Your apparent end game is to push whatever agenda will aid in the oppression of the American citizen through divisive rhetoric.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Being fat puts a huge burden on the healthcare system, imagine if everyone really took care of themselves? Universal healthcare wouldn&#39;t be such a hard topic. But when you have 65% of the adult american population that is classified as overweight and obese, and the health problems that arise from being so fat, then you can see why it&#39;s so expensive. </p>

<p>You can even argue that poor diet and lack of moving leads to poor mental health as well. </p>

<p>To top all that off, being fat, for the 99.9999% of people, is voluntary. You can&#39;t hide behind your thyroid, or whatever condition (excuse) you want to use. So are they a hate group? In the same way that it&#39;s a hate group to look down upon criminals. On the micro level, being fat hurts just you, on the macro level, it hurts everyone, even if you&#39;re fit. </p>

<p>Also seeing as how 65% of adults are fat, they are the majority now. That means by default you are going to upset the majority of people. </p>

<p>EDIT: Come to think of it, r/conspiracy is the last untouched place I know of on reddit, where I trust the mods. So where else to talk about it? </p>

<p>This really about censorship. People were already growing aware of the shadowbanning, the manipulation, moderator power, and deleting posts. And this was just like throwing gas on an already growing fire. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said that it wasn&#39;t. Free speech is very important to me. </p>

<p>However, I think it&#39;s also important for us to exercise our right to free speech in an effective and reasonable manner, especially regarding issues we hold to be important. And I don&#39;t believe that is happening here. Rather, it appears that many people here are bitching for the sake of bitching, which is neither effective nor reasonable. Nor is this the most appropriate forum for such bitching, in my opinion.</p>

<p>But they certainly have the right to continue. I just wish they wouldn&#39;t, as it&#39;s not accomplishing anything productive. </p>
