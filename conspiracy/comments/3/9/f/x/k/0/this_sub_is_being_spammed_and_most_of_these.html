    <div class="md"><p>on the fence about moon landings. Would have made a lot of sense to fake them with the cold war, and the space race.<br/>
  Holocaust I believe happened, but considering the jewish population that was killed was almost entirely orthodox jews who are typically anti-zionism, and considering Israel uses the Holocaust as a shield to divert any and all criticism away from themselves (criticize israel, must be an antisemite.) Not to mention WW2, and the holocaust directly led to the formation of israel.  I believe that the whole thing was a zionist conspiracy.  It works out too perfectly for them,  get rid of your opposition, get what you want out of it, and no one can call you out for the bad stuff you do, because of the tragedies of the past.  But yeah I do believe a large number of jews were killed, but I think it was less about them being jewish, and more about them not being &quot;the right kind of jewish.&quot;</p>

<p>See my major problem with FET is that  planets moving across the sky will go retrograde.  Like move one direction, go the other direction for a bit, and then back to the original direction.  This only makes sense if they are orbiting the sun, not if they are moving around above a flat plane of earth.  The constellations in the sky are different in the southern hemisphere, which seems like it would be unnecessary in a flat earth.  </p>

<p>Like to me for the earth to be flat, and the center of the universe, it would absolutely require a creator, and intelligent design.  And the universe would have to be explicitly designed in a way to observers into believing the earth was round.  So the biggest player in the flat earth conspiracy would be god.  </p>

<p>See I do actually think about these things :)  I think the most important thing you can do with any of this stuff is to think logically about it.  And you know, I may be 100% wrong, but for the moment at-least, with the evidence I&#39;ve seen both ways, I have to say that a round earth makes the most sense to me.</p>

<p>But yeah fuck the FPH spam.</p>

<p>Then you&#39;re not ready. If you still can&#39;t decide whether Stanley Kubrick&#39;s masterpiece was real or not (after almost half a century), go research China&#39;s 2013 Chang&#39;e Rover photos, loving recreations of the artifacts and blemishes of 1960s special effects. Just too bad they had to cancel the manned landings planned for this year...</p>

<p>You should go research the subject more; <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/holocaust/comments/36yk5r/recent_additions_to_the_rholocaust_wiki/">here</a> is a compilation of information that will free you from that hoax.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t the correct way to approach any idea. If you&#39;re a conspiracy veteran, you&#39;ve no doubt learned to approach everything with as few biases and assumptions as possible. You have to start over from the beginning and discard all the previous narratives. The truth can always be rebuilt from the ground up, but if you start with incorrect assumptions you&#39;ll end up in the wrong place every time. You make a lot of assumptions about what &quot;stars&quot; are, and then you go into quite a bit of speculation about everything based on not having an immediate answer to this one question.</p>

<p>Starting over with no assumptions: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecDoKWoaATA">does it feel like you are spinning right now?</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW__MZXMA7A">What does the horizon look like?</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afsb39_6QF0">What do the constellations look like?</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ahhh, everyone seems to post the same video: good thing ive already seen it</p>

<p>So around 6 minutes in he finally presents his argument, Im gonna boil it down and tell me if i have his argument right:</p>

<p>A magnetic force exists atop the mountain at the north pole.</p>

<p>Around 7:50 he presents a scientific argument about a force that he cant explain what it is, how large it is, and what its composed of and why its invisble: he states:</p>

<p><em>Every now and then because of the rotation of the planet this force will get stretched out and it will give you this black, mhmmm,ahhh illusion that theres something there blocking your view. Thats not true, its just, theres something that you are looking at</em></p>

<p><strong>a black body that you cant see, but it remains over the north pole and every now and then, it gets pulled to the side and thats what you see</strong>. </p>

<p>Then he goes into a detail of campuses and how nasa is a cult</p>

<p>Did i get the argument right or did i miss something?</p>
