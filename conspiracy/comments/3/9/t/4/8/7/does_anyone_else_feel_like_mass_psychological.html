Only when we take ourselves out of the water do we begin to see the water. Stop watching television completely for six months, and you will find that you are able to perceive the propaganda stream for what it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even just watching TV. I was raised without it, my mom used to say it would make her dream about commercials. When I was young, I thought that was the stupidest thing ever, I just wanted to watch Ninja Turtles, and I actually liked the commercials aimed at kids a bunch, they were so cool and colorful and showed me all these awesome things that I would want sooooo bad after watching them!</p>

<p>Now that I&#39;m older, and having never had TV for any extended period of time in my life, god damn am I glad I was &quot;deprived&quot; of that luxury. Watching TV with commercials to me is psychologically unbearable, and seems like the remnants of some old era where people were more ok with being propagandized too and enjoyed having their mental spaces cultivated and preplanned for them. The future will be strange because the narrative is really falling apart all around us, the curtains are falling down on this show and while some of us have already woken up to this, a lot of people are just now realizing that something <em>very fucky</em> is going on, to quote Bubbles. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you do this, it works. </p>

<p>But something that can achieve the same thing almost overnight is shrooms or a similar psychedelic experience. These things are demonized and looked down upon unnecessarily.</p>

<p>People think all it does is make you hallucinate. </p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>It puts you into a state of mind which is basically one with everything. You love and appreciate everything. It defragments your hard drive. It doesn&#39;t change how much you know about a subject, but it changes fundamentally how you view the world and the chess pieces at play.</p>

<p>This is why it is illegal and a schedule 1 drug. Yea, maybe the whole world could benefit from smoking a joint.</p>

<p>But what would completely change things?... Psychedelics. No more corporatocracies or waging war for rich people in office buildings. Everyone would live to help each other, regardless of ethnicity or any other background. If everyone were able to feel this experience, we could achieve unbelievable things, from technology to unity in the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These things are not a recreational experience. I think it was Watts that said &quot;when you get the message, hang up the phone&quot;. </p>

<p>And lately I&#39;ve been thinking that right now, they aren&#39;t for everyone. Sometimes rapid decompression is called explosion. Not always a positive experience.</p>

<p>I do empathize with the message you are putting forward though, I just think that some members of the tribe are called to shamanism; some members are called to everything else. </p>

<p>I also agree that some of these things are capable of <em>fundamentally</em> changing how you experience life, how you experience your own consciousness, and how you view the world. However as I stated previously, this is not for everyone. Sometimes people just aren&#39;t ready.</p>

<p>I also agree that everyone should smoke a fucking joint once at least. Again, not for everyone, but people should be doing that instead of drinking alcohol. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t agree that the solution is as easy as that though. I can see parts of it, like reintroducing the spiritual aspects of our lives (without the religion part). Or things like approaching problems with new viewpoints...</p>

<p>I think perhaps I can offer an easier solution: educate. You&#39;ll never be able to change what someone else believes. They have to do it for themselves. You can however offer a different solution, or a new piece for their puzzles, and hope that it starts the ball rolling down the hill a bit. If you educate yourself, you&#39;ll know. Knowing is understanding, knowledge is power. The more you know about something, the easier it becomes to find the easiest point to apply force. The tiniest pebble starts the avalanche. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You got it. It&#39;s funny though, I just finished reading &quot;The Book&quot; by Alan Watts. You&#39;re right, the psychedelic experience isn&#39;t for everyone, but the message you get from one is. </p>

<p>Education really is the best way. And that&#39;s what I&#39;ve said for everyone in that boat to people I know. I&#39;m adamant about it. They don&#39;t understand it though, they think the best solution is to kill the people who don&#39;t agree with you, or put them away. That obviously only creates more friction. They don&#39;t think of education because they think it is impossible for some.</p>

<p>I am spiritual, without the religion part. It is entirely possible and useful in creating a system that acts for the benefit of all, not just a particular niche of thinking. Religion has its ups and downs, but for the most part, it is a distraction from the true nature of things and only causes more friction amongst ourselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol! I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any indoctrination, nor is there subtle symbology...it&#39;s pretty up front about everything and actually quite interesting. The main plot has a lot to do with uncovering/fighting against an Illuminati-type group, nothing hidden about it. I&#39;d recommend you&#39;d give it a shot! It kinda creeped me out at first, too, until I realized they were just slow in hashing out the plot and true antagonizers, then I was like...holy shit, this is sweet!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure what you mean by this. Are you saying he is correct? A cult is a cult is a cult. Whether it helps you in life or makes you a better person does not mean it is for everyone. Before, this may have worked for more people than not but you can also admit the times are changing. The real controlling power reveals itself when your consciousness feels guilty as your natural brain tries to question everything. This is not to say that every action done is because of guilt or fear of punishment and is it is most definitely not to say that the lack of fear or punishment will make us immoral. My problem lies when those actions are based off wrong information. The biggest sin here is the absence of construction and unity based on fear of an ending world. I&#39;d rather build a house that might get toppled over rather do nothing because its been foretold we can&#39;t do anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus is messiah and following him should not be viewed as a cult based on organized religion. If anything it should be the opposite. The elite classes worship Saturn and tarnish the works of Christ, leading the masses away from accepting him as savior. This is because they know freeing us from sin grants us with eternal life. The Jesuits and Zionist bankers perform occult rituals to bring about the end of days, and finance both sides of wars for double purposes. Their biggest power grab to date was WW2 which restored Israel, waking up the final generation spoken of in scripture. This is why we are seeing the NWO rise currently, it&#39;s ALL from Revelations.

<p>Call it what you want, it is a cult, with rituals and sacrifices. The rest of your post is a really cool story but that is all it is. Revelations is super vague and should not be used to tell the future.</p>

All of our stupid traditions like trick or treating stems from the occult, which is very telling. Did you even look at the report I linked or do you scoff at the idea that even you are being tricked into not looking at the very thing that could be true. The biggest conspiracy is the life and works of Jesus Christ, and has been attacked constantly since his crucifixion. We are at the time of his return, which is why all this stuff is being exposed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fasting, eating the body and blood of Christ, baptism, weekly meetings... none of this really displeases me. I&#39;m just trying to show that these are the same things you say the elites do, which they might but i put them in the same boat as the others with rituals and sacrifices. Which goes back to my 2 party religious system comment, the world is not black and white and it just doesn&#39;t fall into good and evil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The imagery you perceive of this is false and has been at constant war since he died for our sins. If you have a problem viewing this world as God vs. Satan, or Israel vs. Babylon, then you&#39;ll never be fit for the deep truth within scripture. Those things you speak of are spiritual within our own selves to attack the enemy within, and naturally every urge within us doesn&#39;t want to fight. Again, whatever you conceive of it psychologically is incorrect, and some of what you discussed is within the OT, which is much different than the NT. When the NWO takes their order out of chaos, remember this discussion. I&#39;d advise you to look into the secrets of freemasonry with an open mind. It&#39;d show you how much the occult actually goes against the name of Jesus, as a direct 1v1 opposition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, i have a problem viewing it as God vs. Satan because that is a fairy tale. One that has kept us in the dark for a long time, the same dark oppressive tones you say the NWO will bring. Order out of chaos is what Christianity and all other religions are too, I&#39;m lumping you all in the same group of people making decisions not based on reality, if its a changing of the guard then you&#39;re the old broken system that needs to go. With all this, entertaining ideas while not believing them is healthy, this is not something are allowed to do while following Jesus.</p>

Which is a really bad way to deal with the world today, we have better tools. I&#39;m on the same boat with you that I&#39;ll keep touting this and eventually we&#39;ll see what happens because ultimately, no one knows, I&#39;m just not afraid to admit it, which makes perfect sense when people lack &quot;the fear of God&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&amp;gt; &quot;Forty-four percent of the American population is convinced that Jesus will return to judge the living and the dead sometime in the next fifty years. According to the most common interpretation of biblical prophecy, Jesus will return only after things have gone horribly awry here on earth. It is, therefore, not an exaggeration to say that if the city of New York were suddenly replaced by a ball of fire, some significant percentage of the American population would see a silver lining in the subsequent mushroom cloud, as it would suggest to them that the best thing that is ever going to happen was about to happen—the return of Christ. It should be blindingly obvious that beliefs of this sort will do little to help us create a durable future for ourselves—socially, economically, environmentally, or geopolitically. Imagine the consequences if any significant component of the U.S. government actually believed that the world was about to end and that its ending would be glorious. The fact that nearly half of the American population apparently believes this, purely on the basis of religious dogma, should be considered a moral and intellectual emergency.The book you are about to read is my response to this emergency...&quot; <a href="http://www.samharris.org/letter-to-a-christian-nation">http://www.samharris.org/letter-to-a-christian-nation</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>The imagery we conceive of Christianity is false and has been at constant war since the crucifixion of Jesus. The true spiritual war he has won for us is being more and more understood as time gets closer to his return. Prophecy is being fulfilled before our very eyes, and God is giving his people the needed information to not only prove Christ as messiah, but to expose the works of Satan throughout all history. This gives us definitive proof that those of us who say this is it are correct this time. That&#39;s because the Jesuits and Zionist bankers manipulated WW2 to restore Israel, bringing us the Luciferian age before the return of Jesus. The elite classes know their time is up, and are having their last moments of control.

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re entitled to your beliefs. I&#39;ve just been researching for a few years now, and I know truth when I see it. When you follow things deep enough, you find the elite class is very occult. This stuff explains ALL of our traditions and with it we can see the political and spiritual purposes of every war. It all kinda tells a story, and allows for us to realize nothing ever changed, it simply adapted. Secret societies worship Saturn from <em>mythology</em>. I did say your reality needs to change in order to see the enemy. Believe it or not, this information breaks you free from control, not the other way around. Psychologically you want nothing to do with it because you&#39;re new to this information and the controlling factor within you rejects it strongly. If you think <strong>critically</strong> about the world around you, and give it time, you&#39;ll find that this is truth. There&#39;s plenty of resources in the document linked, check it out some time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Watch what you say dude. If you think it&#39;s fairy tails, that&#39;s the false imagery the enemy wants you to think it is. The truth is that the bankers perform blood sacrifices behind closed doors... Ya know, like the Mayans. Nothing ever changed, it adapted.</p>

<p>Oh, but 9/11 wasn&#39;t a blood sacrifice done by Freemasons to Moloch. Do you even know what you&#39;re talking about? How the hell do you come to the conclusion Satan is savior? It&#39;s easier talking about it to the conspiracy crowd who isn&#39;t afraid to call out the corruptive force in the world, but people here don&#39;t spiritually analyze the force itself. I&#39;d advise you sit back and think about the vague possibility that the &quot;crazy conspiracy theorists&quot; are one step closer to disclosing the satanic force binding this world.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>2 Peter 3</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:<br/>
That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour:<br/>
<strong>Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,</strong><br/>
<strong>And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.</strong><br/>
For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:<br/>
Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:<br/>
But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.<br/>
But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.<br/>
<strong>The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.</strong><br/>
But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.<br/>
Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness,<br/>
Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?<br/>
Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.<br/>
Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.<br/>
And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you;<br/>
As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.<br/>
Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness.<br/>
But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He is waiting for the gospel to be heard in the entire world and is giving every individual the fullest opportunity possible to acquire salvation. Take heed and repent, for the hour of His judgment is upon us.</p>

<p>The people didn&#39;t believe Noah... they scoffed at his warning. They continued making merry until the very day the rain came and by then it was too late. Their fate was sealed and they perished. You don&#39;t have to be like them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The flood was preached for hundreds of years before it came. God does nothing without telling His servants, the prophets. He has His people in every generation and is just; giving all a fair chance to repent of wickedness. He wants you to develop a moral character so that you can be a member of His eternal kingdom. His law is eternal and unchanging. His yoke is light. His character is perfect and Holy and He is the only person worthy of looking up to in this world.</p>

<p>Thank you for fulfilling prophecy today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But doesn&#39;t the fact that Israel was written down thousands of years ago as a prophecy that needed to be fulfilled in order for <em>x</em> to happen, make it less of a &quot;whoa&quot; moment when Israel actually is created?

    <div class="md"><p>The Holy Spirit works through us. We minister one to another and go back to the scripture for ultimate authority.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?<br/>
And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.<br/>
<strong>Acts 8:30-31</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>When we learn something extra-biblically, we must be able to demonstrate it solely via the scriptures. There should be no other text required, but the idea that you should never learn anything from anyone is not backed by scripture. Even Moses took advice from his father-in-law on how to organize and instruct the people (Exodus 18:13-27); He was humble enough to know that, though his position was exalted, he was not above being instructed.</p>

<p>It is not a lack of faith, but rather a demonstration of faith when we look to others for new understandings. The Lord has blessed us all with varying gifts and it is our duty to share them with one another. The Bible is our common ground of agreement so that we can verify everything we hear, but we shouldn&#39;t close our ears to everything and be ignorant.</p>

<p>We must agree on doctrine or we must be separate, because God calls His people to come out of Babylon and be separate. All the world wonders after the beast. There is only one movement and one church that is the body of Christ, and there are a majority of false prophets.

    <div class="md"><p>&amp;gt; &quot;Forty-four percent of the American population is convinced that Jesus will return to judge the living and the dead sometime in the next fifty years. According to the most common interpretation of biblical prophecy, Jesus will return only after things have gone horribly awry here on earth. It is, therefore, not an exaggeration to say that if the city of New York were suddenly replaced by a ball of fire, some significant percentage of the American population would see a silver lining in the subsequent mushroom cloud, as it would suggest to them that the best thing that is ever going to happen was about to happen—the return of Christ. It should be blindingly obvious that beliefs of this sort will do little to help us create a durable future for ourselves—socially, economically, environmentally, or geopolitically. Imagine the consequences if any significant component of the U.S. government actually believed that the world was about to end and that its ending would be glorious. The fact that nearly half of the American population apparently believes this, purely on the basis of religious dogma, should be considered a moral and intellectual emergency.The book you are about to read is my response to this emergency...&quot; <a href="http://www.samharris.org/letter-to-a-christian-nation">http://www.samharris.org/letter-to-a-christian-nation</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe purely on the basis of religious dogma. I believe based on supernatural realities.</p>

<p>The world is coming to an end soon. The papacy is establishing her power once again and will have it in all of its corrupt, ungodly &#39;glory.&#39; Sin is rampant, sin is the problem, and sin must be dealt with; Satan must be dealt with.</p>

<p>The emergency is the fact that a significant portion of the population is at risk of losing their eternal souls. This world is fleeting... it is vanity. There is a much larger reality and wrapping our minds up in the here and now is committing ourselves to ignorance, unhappiness, and death. We should be concerned about the eternal well being of others secured in our faith of deliverance from bondage.</p>

<p>God is absolutely real and His judgment is at hand. Fear God and give glory to Him! Keep His commandments and testify of the name Jesus Christ! As a man sow, shall he reap; shall we not sow the kingdom of God, available to us here and now? His word is as sure as the vast misinterpretations there are of it. Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In your opinion. I&#39;ll stick with God. </p>

<p>And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth. These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth. And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed. These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will. And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them. And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified. And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves. And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth. And after three days and an half the Spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them which saw them. And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up hither. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld them. (‭Revelation‬ ‭11‬:‭3-12‬ KJV)</p>

<p>For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book: And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book. He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus. (‭Revelation‬ ‭22‬:‭18-20‬ KJV)</p>

<p>Surely I come quickly. </p>

<p><strong>Zechariah 4</strong> identifies these symbols for us.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep.<br/>
And said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold a candlestick all of gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which are upon the top thereof:<br/>
<strong>And two olive trees by it, one upon the right side of the bowl, and the other upon the left side thereof.</strong><br/>
So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying, What are these, my lord?<br/>
Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord.<br/>
Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, <strong>This is the word of the Lord</strong> unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord of hosts.<br/>
Who art thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings, crying, Grace, grace unto it.<br/>
Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,<br/>
The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto you.<br/>
For who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel with those seven; they are the eyes of the Lord, which run to and fro through the whole earth.<br/>
Then answered I, and said unto him, <strong>What are these two olive trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left side thereof?</strong><br/>
And I answered again, and said unto him, <strong>What be these two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of themselves?</strong><br/>
And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord.<br/>
Then said he, <strong>These are the two anointed ones, that stand by the Lord of the whole earth.</strong></p>

<p>Revelation isn&#39;t a trip; it&#39;s a detailed, symbolic prophecy. All of the symbolism is covered in the scriptures to paint a very clear picture of exactly what Revelation is talking about. I invite you to check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7VqcnY4rdc">Revelation: The Bride, The Beast, and Babylon</a>.</p>

<p>For a quick and dirty on the Antichrist in Bible prophecy, check out <a href="http://www.bibleprophecytruth.com/topics/who-is-the-antichrist-.aspx">this website</a>. The information contained there is indeed truth, as you can discover for yourself within the scripture and historical fact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know if its more blatant now than in the past. I think its more a matter of personal stages of epiphany. I&#39;ve had quite a number of them through my lifetime. I used to believe that things could be changed through the political process. Say what you will about Obama, but man, the guy is a great actor. He made the last two elections look like they meant something. To come back down from that high as a citizen and see Hillary Clinton who is obscenely rich and a war hawk try to pretend that shes down with blue collar workers and liberals is a disgusting experience.</p>

<p>That, coupled with the rise of soft power drones (social justice warriors, feminists, etc.) to keep people distracted (bread and circuses) by gendered and racial conflict while the world burns has really been a downer.</p>

<p>I thought this new generation was going to be different. But no, millennials are by far the most subverted generation to date. Thats why it might seem like things are more blatant now, the propaganda is geared towards a different demographic now, and people who are removed from the way that generation thinks (regardless of whether you belong to said generation or not) are probably going to be the least oblivious to whats going on.</p>

<p>Networks used to end their programing at night with the star spangled banner. Now they close with news/comedy programs telling your biggest danger is the opposite gender/race. The methods change, but the game is still the same.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>once you become awake, you see it everywhere. I definently have noticed far more obtuse methods though. The IFLS fb page releasing &quot;Conspirarcy theroists believe anything&quot; and &quot;Why conspiracy theorists are dumb&quot; propaganda seemed really super obvious as to what they where trying to do, to further enable congnitive dissonance to people who are starting to wake up. </p>

<p>I think its a good thing when i see that. The entire post had about 19 out 20 people saying how pathetic the piece was and listing memes of conspiracies they believe in, which was numbers i was not expecting to see on those pages.</p>

<p>I think people waking up is becoming easier with the internet and with the progressive funnelling of all major funds into the oligarchs with the slow cutting off of peoples resources, services etc.... </p>

<p>The whole system is imploding. So fascism is the only way the oligarchs get to keep what they have stolen from us all. I think humanity has what it takes to not go down that road.</p>

<p>Too much information out there now, we are too connected with each other.</p>

<p>YES i see it is getting more dramatic, but its always been there. The more awake you are , the longer you are awake the more severe the propaganda seems </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The dumber people get the less covert things need to be.  </p>

<p>When reddit started it wasn&#39;t the Lowest common denominator who flocked here, it was those who were a little more computer savy and interested in things that weren&#39;t seen in the mainstream. 
Now, there is a large following from the general public here.  And with that, the overall IQ of people who browse and post in reddit has collective fallen to around 95.  </p>

<p>So, most people won&#39;t even notice, care or question the banning and the removal of the subs and users because it does not effect them and they probably can&#39;t even track
It mentally.</p>

<p>So there is that..</p>

<p>But for people like us, we notice it,
We see what is happening and we can find ways around it, or choose to ignore it.
I for one am not a fan of the fascist turn this company has taken.   I only really come to reddit anymore to browse this sub and a few others.  Many of the subs I used to go to for &quot;news&quot; I don&#39;t even bother with anymore because it&#39;s the same crap I see on CNN Fox and other mainstream sources.  </p>

<p>Soon I will leave this place and forget that I even had a place I could go and find out info that not everyone was privy to yet. And that&#39;s just sad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just about all news needs to be avoided.  Print stories from select sources can generally provided enough data for analytical considerations but even those can be skewed.  A simple headline can provide substantial bias to prep the mind for a specific viewpoint.  Bottom line, broadcast media is pretty much toxic now, even local news.  It&#39;s addictive and dangerous.  Avoid as often as possible for better mental health and emotional stability.  Bear in mind that they will be bringing us to the brink of fighting each other in the street when the Presidential election kicks off in earnest.  Give your self a break.  Shut the shit off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since the beginning of television I believe, and it&#39;s evolved to a beast that I don&#39;t think we fully grasp.  It&#39;s on the airwaves, radio, tv, movies, the internet.  Subliminal messages are a billion dollar industry in advertisement.  They don&#39;t call it that, they say things like, well we want to make the viewer feel calm here, and cringe at this, and then point them to our product.  Now we&#39;re on overload.  I could imagine if autism isn&#39;t directly linked to some chemicals or exposures of some sort, that much of it may be attributed (or other psychological conditions) to basically a sensory overload.  People that see these messages as conscious thoughts whose minds work differently than ours, might not be able to handle it, as the subconscious decodes all these messages automatically.  It seems like it is being done in a massive effort, by all government, countries, corporations, crime, special interests.  Too broad a subject to cover.  Mass hysteria, mass panic, mass outrage, people are being divided into groups and herded.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&#39;&#39;make a society&#39;&#39; haw haw. That sounds like eugenicist fabian socialist propaganda. I&#39;ll pass on the society planning, thanks though.<br/>
Not trying to be a dick, but don&#39;t you see this as a fantasy: &#39;&#39; If everyone is considering everyone else and working towards their ideal the world will be great.&#39;&#39; ?<br/>
You should look into Alice Bailey&#39;s &#39;&#39;Education in the New Age&#39;&#39; and the essential founding document of UNESCO, written by Aldous Huxley&#39;s brother Julian, inspiring A. to write Brave New World.<br/>
Anyone who hasn&#39;t read the latter, who pretends to know about world society planning, or the UN , is in dreamy fantasy land with little knowledge of what they are speaking of.<br/>
The late 19th and early 20th centuries were filled with world society planners out the ass, influencing the robber barons and the founders of the Federal Reserve bank, I&#39;ve hardly met anyone in my 51 years who has an interest in such literature as I do.<br/>
I do meet lots of dreamers who think that world society planning is the milieu of the lowly citizen and their utopian dreams. Meanwhile the concept was fully co-opted a century or so ago by the elites.<br/>
Read that UNESCO doc. It is no joke.<br/>
Aldous Huxley exposes them in his barely mentioned book &#39;&#39;Ends and Means&#39;&#39;, all about the social planning for a world society, by the elites he spent lots of time with in discussion of such.<br/>
Robert Muller is the top dog of all time at the UN.<br/>
Dig deep into him and see how culty and weird he was, as the most powerful person in the history of the UN.<br/>
You are perfect fodder for their cultish designs.<br/>
Please do more research on world social planning. You are respectfully being duped.  </p>

My game is encouraging people to make things by hand. The only thing separating us from the lowly beasts. Hand crafted useful or decorative items.<br/>

Check out the pride in folks&#39; voices when they say &#39;&#39;My grandfather built that&#39;&#39;.<br/>

The other reply at his core says the same &quot;consider what local actions will do globally&quot; , only difference is he adds &quot;for the greater good&quot; which is not part of the sentence and his interpretation based on his own goals. With every example you get the same core - taking a look at the bigger picture to better understand what action will best serve your own goal. The only difference is the goal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please don&#39;t preach to me. Religion is just control. I&#39;ll be spiritual in my mind and my heart. If God has a prophecy it will not be initiated by sociopathic human beings. You comfort yourself with the bible when convenient. Where&#39;s all of the angels and demons and beasts? Why can&#39;t religious people act as if we have real world problems that can be changed and not just get people to &quot;believe&quot; and join their club. Don&#39;t let people in power invade your truth with their falsehoods.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everything is just control, if you let it control you. Bible does not comfort me, if anything it makes me try and be better. I don&#39;t feel safer knowing God exists. There&#39;s nothing convenient about believing in God. On the contrary, not believing is extremely convenient.</p>

<p>Look at the problems of today and tell me, why do we have them? Why are people so careless with each other? Why is everyone so passive and ignorant of others problems?</p>

<p>It&#39;s because we are being taught from birth that we came out of nothing and will become nothing. The Big Bang theory is meant to make us feel worthless and insignificant. That&#39;s why we don&#39;t do anything about anything. This is the root cause of all the problems today.</p>

<p>If we realized that we actually do have a purpose, a meaning, everything will change. Belief in God puts us in the spotlight, gives us responsibility for our actions. Disbelief makes us savages, exactly what we are today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could be a god or gods but i dont believe in a jealous god, or a wrathful god, or a god that judges you on anymore than your treatment of others....there may not even be a god. If the bible is true, noone is making it to heavan. I especially dont believe we should assume that evil people are anything more than evil people.

    <div class="md"><p>I used to think exactly like you, until I found out about the occult, their sacrifices and rituals. Existence of ghosts or supernatural or demons or whatever you want to call it also helps the case. Try Ouiji board if you thinks they don&#39;t exist. Basically, I found out that God must exist through finding the devil.</p>

<p>Judge us on treatment of others? of course, that is the most important thing. 5 of 10 commandments are exactly for that. The other 5 come naturally once you find out that God is real.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not supposed to be easy to live with God. We are all too used to easy life choices and accept the easiest way as the right one. Rarely it&#39;s the case.</p>
