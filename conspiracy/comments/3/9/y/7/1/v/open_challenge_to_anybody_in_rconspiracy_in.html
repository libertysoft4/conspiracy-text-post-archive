</ul>

<p><em>Principal Authors: David Scott (CTBUH / Arup), Simon Lay (WSP) &amp; Daniel O&#39;Connor (Schirmer Engineering)
 Published by CTBUH, Chicago, October 2008</em></p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a study, more so them giving their professional opinion on the NIST report as an organization. They however didn&#39;t agree with NIST&#39;s mechanism of collapse. NIST believe WTC 7 collapse due to the failure of column 79, while CTBUH believes it was due to:</p>

<p>From page 10. . .</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The Council does not agree with the NIST statement that the failure was a result of the buckling of Column 79. We believe that the failure was a result of the collapse of the floor structure that led to loss of lateral restraint and then buckling of internal columns. This is an important distinction, as NIST appears to be seeking improved performance from floors rather than columns. The Council would like to know if there are any simple changes to the floors and connections that would have resulted in a better performance than occurred.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So instead of it being due to column 79, the reached a different conclusion and said it was from the floor structure. However, none state Controlled Demolition as their conclusion. So you have to find information that disagrees with their conclusion.</p>

</ul>

<p><em>Authors: J. Takagi and G.G. Deierlein</em></p>

<p>From page 18. . .</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The probable sequence of events leading to the collapse of WTC 7 is illustrated in Figure 2-5. The collapse initiation most probably occurred at the column number 79, 80 and/or 81 possibly including other interior columns 69, 72, 75, 78 and 78A (see Figure 2-3) on Floor 13 or lower floors. Because the collapse initiated at the eastern part of the building, traveled west in approximately 7 seconds and the global collapse started almost simultaneously, the column failures progressed horizontally around the transfer stories (between floor 5 and 7) (see Figure 2-3(c)) and ultimately lead to global instability.&quot;</p>

Any existing studies, or submitting your own. If you have information in regards to assumptions they did not take into account when coming to their respective conclusions, then post that too.

<p>Your conclusion, not mine. You keep making the same mistake, namely arguing from a premise not in evidence.</p>

<p>I read through that. It doesn&#39;t refute the study by <em>McAllister, T., MacNeill, R., Erbay, O., Sarawit, A., Zarghamee, M., Kirkpatrick, S., and Gross, J. (doi: 10.1061/(ASCE)ST.1943-541X.0000398) *. That is not a refutation. What the author did was make criticism of some of the assumptions used. Which is fine, you have to make assumptions. CTUBUH came to *different</em> conclusions based on different assumptions also. They claimed the failure emanated from the collapse of the floor structure that led to loss of lateral restraint and then buckling of internal columns. Meanwhile ASCE and another study I believe said it was due to the failure of column 79. They had different conclusions, based on different assumptions and computations made. The author never made a positive claim in <em>favor</em> for controlled demolition, he <em>just</em> criticized the assumptions made, which anybody can do, and is somewhat of a moot point because you can criticize the assumptions of any study in regards to WTC 7 due to the complexity and limited amount of concrete data. How ever, even in the storm of all of this, not once does Controlled Demolition come up, and that is my point. They will have verbatim back and forth in regards to which floor, which column was the culprit of failure. Nowhere is Controlled Demolition even an option of being considered.</p>

<p>. . . .Sure. And <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction_stir_welding">friction stir welding</a> is a thing. Put metal in the presence of pressure and movement and insane quantities of heat can be generated. Yes, enough to melt steel.</p>

<p>What do you think was happening at the bottom of the pile as everything was coming down?</p>

<p>Hint: Movement and insane pressures.</p>

<p>In other words, jet fuel was not required to melt steel. Gravity (and friction) did a fine job of it all by themselves once things started to move.</p>

This paper makes no attempt to explain WTC 7&#39;s collapse itself and agrees that it requires further investigation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The most important point from this review [of past fire disasters] is that no steel building has totally collapsed by fire alone except perhaps WTC 7 [pg. 183]</p>

<p>Because WTC building 7 is the only steel building that is on record as having globally collapsed due to fire...further investigations including analytical simulations are desired. [pg 18.]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m saying what you pasted from that paper was disingenuous. You made it seem as if the WTC 7 collapse description was based on the conclusions of the research presented in this paper, but it is merely a summary of NIST (2004) in a small, rather irrelevant, introductory part of this paper. This paper focuses on nothing specific to WTC 7 (or any other disaster) and it studies the accuracy of the AISC strength design equations by simulating a generic 10-story building fire at various temperatures and burn times. The only reason WTC is even mentioned is because Chapter 2 &quot;provides an overview of the behavior of steel structures exposed to fire&quot; [pg. 9]. </p>

<p>I also find it funny you would ask us to challenge a paper that clearly states WTC 7 requires more investigation. To be fair - do the authors of this paper believe WTC 7 was a controlled demolition? No, probably not. However, that conclusion is well outside the scope of this paper&#39;s research and whatever value this paper has, it isn&#39;t in debunking 911 conspiracy theories.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do understand that an academic paper is not inevitably definitive proof, right?  I mean, if you&#39;re publishing results of a rigorous experiment to construct a phase diagram for some simple chemicals or something, you&#39;re probably going to be spot on.  But other subjects such as this one do not work the same way.  Papers are essentially scientific opinions.  They are not always correct. Many times, someone comes along later and refutes unequivocally something proposed by another researcher.</p>

<p>That all being said, this is from the first line of the paper: &quot;World Trade Center 7 (WTC 7) was structurally damaged by debris during the collapse of WTC 1...&quot;  That is a <em>major</em> assumption.  I would like to know how that happened; how the fires started.  This is hardly discussed.  They say that the building had initial structural damage.  Ok, fine.  Then they say that the fires caused other building elements to fail, and that the entire structure failed as a result of these things.  This assumption of thermal expansion is also a major problem because it assumes enough fire to cause the thermal expansion.  Where did all of these fires come from? How is it that the World Trade Center in general was like a magical fire day.  Three well-built skyscrapers all just happened to be taken down by glorified office fires all on the same day.  And no damage was even cause to WTC 7 other than debris from WTC 1.  </p>

<p>So you can think what you want.  But there are many ways to obscure the truth.  These scientists may have had an agenda, and made sure their results matched that agenda.  Ultimately, some issues are best solved yourself using your own critical thinking.</p>

<p>Your links are just an appeal to a false authority. Two basic facts contradict any certainty that building 7 collapsed due to fire:-</p>

<p>1) No high-rise steel-framed building has ever collapsed through fire before or since. </p>

<p>2) Nobody tested for explosives. Hence, explosives cannot be ruled out as a cause.</p>

<p>There were over one hundred eye-witness statements involving explosions, and nobody tested for explosives. That just shows the tremendous lack of credibility your &quot;study&quot; has.

    <div class="md"><p>Okay if you&#39;re not indoctrinated then I invite you to go look for the truth yourself.  Use critical thinking skills.  When a report defies the laws of physics, and is written by someone who may have something to hide, take it&#39;s contents with a grain of salt.  There is a reason that all of the &quot;Official&quot; reports back up the government&#39;s story.  If the &quot;status quo&quot; wasn&#39;t made up of people drank the cool-aid and didn&#39;t question official reports, the world would be a much different place.  The &quot;status quo&quot; is made up of people who get their opinions from CNN, MSNBC and FoxNews, so that they can get right back to posting their selfies on facebook.</p>

<p>If you are looking for an &quot;official&quot; government sanctioned report that doesn&#39;t support the &quot;official&quot; story, you are wasting your time.  </p>

<p>But if you look into the whole thing with an open mind, and look for evidence yourself, you should be able to find enough to make you question the &quot;official&quot; reports.  But no one can convince you of something that you&#39;re not willing to believe.  You will have to figure it out on your own.</p>

<p>My advice is... don&#39;t.  Stay asleep.  Believe what you hear on the news, and what your government tells you.  You will be much happier that way.  Realizing the things that the people at the top are capable of can add a lot of unnecessary cynicism to your life.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could this be a more condescending answer?</p>

<p>All OP did was post a study that he thought had merit and invited people to explain why they thought it was wrong. </p>

<p>If it&#39;s so blatantly easy to do, why not just do it? If someone posts a theory claiming the sky was red, I wouldn&#39;t need to call him a shill or a troll or a sheep to rebut him, or give him veiled and mysterious suggestions that the truth was out there. I&#39;d just point out the blue sky to him. </p>

<p>Why is that so hard to do? Is there a specific reason why this person shouldn&#39;t be provided facts as rebutal instead of insults and accusations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry, could you please point out the &quot;insults and accusations&quot; I used for my &quot;condescending&quot; answer?</p>

<p>Back to your red sky/blue sky metaphor.  If I thought the sky was blue, but there was a group of people who thought it was red, I would just be happy to believe what I observed.  I wouldn&#39;t post a report I found on &quot;blue sky weekly&quot; about &quot;why the sky is blue&quot;, with the tantalizing promise that &quot;if someone can disprove this report, I will be a red skyer.&quot;  </p>

<p>If it is condescending to say what I said, then I apologize.  But my point stands.  This person doesn&#39;t want to be convinced of something he doesn&#39;t already believe.  If he did, he would be willing to do his own research.  Since he isn&#39;t willing to do that, I&#39;m not willing to try to change his mind for him.  </p>

<p>And what makes you think OP hasn&#39;t done his own research? It seems to me he has done a good deal of research, came across a study that he thought had merit, and invited discussion on it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I accept your apology.</p>

<p>but for the record, his research included the NIST survey.  Which was a non-empirical study with unrepeatable results, based on classified information that is still not available, and receiving no peer review.  So to me at least, the nist study holds just as much water as a shitty youtube video.</p>

<p>And no, I don&#39;t give any fucks what OP believes.  Which is why I didn&#39;t bother refuting his &quot;evidence.&quot;  Because I have no interest in making him a &quot;truther&quot;.</p>

<p>I do find Ops post to be rather condescending, since where going to talk about feelings, and you seem to be in the business of getting butt-hurt on other peoples behalf.  </p>

<p>If he wants to know <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>&#39;s opinion on building seven, there is a handy little search button in the top right of the screen.  Instead he posts &quot;I believe this, and so does almost everyone else.  Here&#39;s some government sponsored documents that agree with me.  Now someone prove me wrong and I&#39;ll be on your team.&quot;</p>

<p>Fuck that, no one cares what Op believes.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s like going into <a href="/r/Atheism">/r/Atheism</a> and posting...</p>

<p>&quot;Hey guys, I believe in God, and so does almost every one else.  All the religious texts that I&#39;ve read support the existence of God.
Including:
The Bible
The Koran
The Torah
and many others.</p>

<p>Everyone but you believes in one true god, so I ask you...
Can you find me a phrase in a Judeo-Christian Religious text that disputes my claim?  If so I will become an atheist.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why? because I refuse to argue with Ops post?  From what I can tell, the people who are trying to argue against information presented in his &quot;evidence&quot; are being hit with qualifiers from op, about why their source isn&#39;t credible.  When op was forthcoming about his position on the argument, and reserved the right to decide on his own accord what evidence is &quot;credible&quot; and what isn&#39;t, I could tell how this thread was going to go.
But yeah, since I&#39;m not going to argue with someone who reserves the right to reject any information I may provide that supports my argument... I&#39;m defecting.   </p>

The reason it will take me a year is I&#39;m not an architect, physicist or structural engineer. The reason I can do it at all is that I am an engineer and am familiar with finite difference modeling and how thermophysical properties of materials respond to things like heat. Having trouble finding what I&#39;d need to build an accurate model? OH YEA THE DATA ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WAY SMARTER THAN ME WOULD HAVE DONE THIS ALREADY AND PUT ALL OF THE TRUTHERS&#39; DEMOLITION CLAIMS TO REST FOR GOOD. NIST won&#39;t release their model and the data used to build it for public review and perhaps more importantly the source of that data. This is literally the only thing the AE911 guys want and I can&#39;t help but agree with them. It&#39;s a pretty reasonable request and would shut all the 911 conspiracy theorists up <em>permanently</em> and save people like you from wasting their time on internet forums asking for proof. What you are asking for literally cannot be done because NIST is witholding all the most important shit. Satisfied?  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve never heard anyone contend it was the landing gear.  </p>

<p>However, I&#39;ve heard plenty of people say it was the blister on the underside that partially housed the landing gear, because that&#39;s what it almost certainly is.</p>

<p>By mounting the gear partially outside the plane of the fuselage, it allows more cargo hold space.  <a href="http://www.itsabouttravelling.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/c-ftjp-03.jpg">Here</a> is a great pic illustrating the fairings on the 767 line.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes, the sun tends to glint off polished metal surfaces, a fact which is accentuated by the camera.</p>

<p>Really, I don&#39;t know how one is supposed to tell <em>anything</em> from such low-quality photos.  Even if there <em>was</em> an additional blister or &quot;pod&quot; on the underside of the plane, it&#39;d be very difficult to tell for sure at this resolution.</p>

<p>To the hypothesis itself:  Have you ever seen a missile launch?  There&#39;s no glint, or flash - <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/US_Navy_030323-N-5642T-001_A_Tomahawk_Land_Attack_Missile_%28TLAM%29_is_launched_from_the_guided_missile_cruiser_USS_Anzio.jpg/403px-US_Navy_030323-N-5642T-001_A_Tomahawk_Land_Attack_Missile_%28TLAM%29_is_launched_from_the_guided_missile_cruiser_USS_Anzio.jpg">there&#39;s a horribly bright, unmistakeable plume of orange fire</a> that streaks out the back of the missile.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also the fact that it&#39;d take one hell of a large missile to do any sort of major damage to a building the size of the WTC towers, especially launched at such close proximity.  With as much open space as resided on the floors of the towers, it&#39;d be as likely as not that the missile would through-and-through the building and wind up landing in the city somewhere.  </p>

<p>It&#39;d be far easier to just pack the cargo hold full of explosives with redundant impact-sensitive fuzes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the sun will reflect light from the building.  Not at the last second from all the different angles in to the camera lens.   </p>

<p>Poor quality or not, there are better quality stills, and even with the quality, you can tell there something on the bottom part of the aircraft that isn&#39;t suppose to be there that casts its own shadow.  <a href="http://i.imgur.com/KVQalXc.jpg">Here is a good pic of the belly of a 767.</a>  How does that at all <a href="http://i.imgur.com/uoen6as.jpg">resemble this?</a>  Again, I do not to claim to know what it is, or what comes out of it.   I claim that is not a normal commercial aircraft.  I claim that a flash occurs prior to impact.  What it is, I don&#39;t know. </p>

<p>I never said it was a missle.  You are making that assumption. Thats the whole point.  I don&#39;t know what it was, you don&#39;t know what it was, but something appears to come from that extra part on the bottom of the plane. That is why we need a new investigation which is the only thing I ever assert.   And the first investigation was faught every step of the way by the Bush administration, and was a total joke.</p>

<p>Let minds smarter than us figure out what happened and who was really responsible.  The fact we don&#39;t know is all the more reason for a new invesitgation.  The fact we dont know how the pyrmids were built, doesn&#39;t mean they aren&#39;t there.  It means we should investigate and try to figure it out.</p>

<p>Finally, you say it would take a large missle to cause major damage to a building like that.  </p>

<p>Would an aluminum bodied aircraft slice through steel like that?  The engines would at that speed, but what about the nose of the plane?  Slam a pop can into a steel beam at speed, does it make a cartoon like hole through the steel?  Or would it crumple up like the aluminum tube it is and bounce off?  Drive a semi truck at full speed into a freight train standing still, what happens?  Does the truck punch a hole through the train? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP has to keep his word and become a truther. Here is a peer-reviewed chemical physics paper from Professor Harrit which directly refutes the papers he linked:-</p>

<p>Let&#39;s for argument&#39;s sake say you&#39;re a shady entity planning to blow up a few buildings and spin a counter story to the public. Are you saying that if it were you, you&#39;d have no counter story? A blind appeal to authority just isn&#39;t going to cut it when the topic is as politically hot as 9/11. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) The study you posted does not refute any of the studies in the OP. Even if your study is 100% correct, it =/ mechanism of collapse, it just mean some thermitic material was found, that is it. You still have the burden of proof of explaining how it can bring down a very large structure, and how thousands of pounds of this stuff was sneaked in complete secrecy. On top of that, you have to explain why this material wasn&#39;t from the burning cars, and other rubble, and why you specifically think it emanated from any one of the towers that collapsed. The burden of proof is enormous. </p>

<p>Secondly, if I had a nickel for every time a truther posted that study, I would be rich. It&#39;s been debunked so many times. There is even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbjYoINw5oI">a video debunking that same <em>exact</em> study you posted.</a> Skip to 3:05</p>

<p>I can clearly see you didn&#39;t d your research.</p>

<p>False. You have clearly not even read the study if that&#39;s what you think. Your denialism is startling.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You still have the burden of proof of explaining how it can bring down a very large structure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no burden of proof that thermite can bring down a large structure. You sound like you&#39;re 12 years old and have just learned what thermite is. The East Sky Ride Tower was demolished using thermite in 1935, for God&#39;s sake. It&#39;s given to the military to blow holes in tank armour.</p>

<p>Your furious denials are just amusing to me, tbh. You&#39;re engrossed in your own ego and it&#39;s covering up how stupid the things you believe in are.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Lol. Peer-reviewed is it? Then forgive me if I ignore it. Harrit&#39;s paper has been out since 2009 and not a single, solitary peer-reviewed refutation exists. I challenge you to find one.</p>

<p>To be clear, let me restate the test which makes a real scientific paper. It has to be published in a respected scientific journal. As an example, The Journal of Engineering Mechanics is a well respected scientific journal. The peer review proccess is tough and precise. The reviewers are well respected in their fields of expertise. The Journal of the American Chemical Society is another which Jones can submit his papers. There are many well respected journals which have an impact in the scientific community. Bentham, where Jones has submitted his latest paper, is the Wiki of Journals. They have been criticized in the past for passing &quot;gibberish&quot;. One editor resigned after learning Jones paper passed their review. It seems the reviewers are told of the paper AFTER they are passed. Amazing! Though Jones may have found the perfect home for his latest attempt at peer-review, it is far from a respected scientific journal. </p>

<p>But is Professor Jones qualified to create a paper which says the towers must have fallen due to explosives? He is a physics professor but what experience does Jones have in building collapse forensics? He has none. His other peer reviewed papers consist of cold fusion technology. He conducts  research in nuclear fusion and solar energy. Nothing in his background would suggest he is qualified to write a civil engineering paper on the infinitely complex building collapse of the towers.</p>

<p>Brigham Young University doesn&#39;t want anything to do with the paper. </p>

<p>A few department chairmen at Jones&#39; university have issued critical statements, though none of these has yet addressed any of the points which Jones made in his paper and at his presentation at BYU. </p>

<p><em>Chairman of the BYU department of Civil and Environmental Engineering</em>, Dr. Miller, is on record stating in an e-mail:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I think without exception, the <strong>structural engineering professors</strong> in our department are <strong>not in agreement with the claims made by Jones in his paper</strong>, and they don&#39;t think there is accuracy and validity to these claims&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p><em>The BYU physics department has also issued a statement:</em> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The university is aware that Professor Steven Jones&#39; hypotheses and interpretations of evidence regarding the collapse of World Trade Center buildings are being questioned by a number of scholars and practitioners, including many of BYU&#39;s own faculty members. <strong>Professor Jones&#39; department and college administrators are not convinced that his analyses and hypotheses have been submitted to relevant scientific venues that would ensure rigorous technical peer review.&quot;</strong> </p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><em>The College of Engineering and Technology department has also added:</em> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The structural engineering faculty in the Fulton College of Engineering and Technology <strong>do not support the hypotheses of Professor Jones.&quot;</strong></p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<p>So that has been debunked numerous times, and he is an intellectual outcast. Why do you choose to believe in foolishness? I don&#39;t get it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You asked for a study which refuted you. I provided one, which, unlike yours, has been peer-reviewed.</p>

<p>At least you&#39;ve been revealed for a silly little troll though, who wasn&#39;t even slightly serious about having the capacity to retract his own bias. </p>

<p>Your smear attacks against the characters of the people involved in the paper do not interest me, and neither does your homemade Youtube video which you absurdly claim &quot;debunks&quot; a peer-reviewed chemistry paper. Predictably, you want to accuse the scientists who wrote it of being Satan worshippers and are not even slightly interested in confronting their actual scientific research. </p>

<p>You&#39;re a joke.  I didn&#39;t ask for 600 words of smear attacks written in bold. I asked for a peer-reviewed refutation of Harrit&#39;s paper. Give me one or gtfo.</p>

<p><strong>Academic freedom at Brigham Young University has been the subject of several controversies regarding the school, mostly focusing on its religious nature.</strong></p>

<p><strong>BYU&#39;s academic freedom policies have been criticized by the American Association of University Professors (AAUP). In 1997, they issued a report documenting the cases of several professors concluding &quot;that infringements on academic freedom are distressingly common and that the climate for academic freedom is distressingly poor.&quot;</strong></p>
