<p>&#39;Edit: I just realized you meant that the building collapsed uniformly, so that means the structure had to lose integrity simultaneously across the entire structure, and your issue was with the &quot;across the entire structure&quot; part. The issue with this is all of the beams are connected, and in a progressive failure, the failure of one component causes the load on the others to become too high, causing them to also fail. I don&#39;t see how this isn&#39;t consistent with what you can see here.&#39;  </p>

<p>how do you reconcile uniform collapse with &#39;progressive collapse&#39;  with WTC7?  there&#39;s no &#39;progressive collapse&#39;  - all structural support disappeared.  that&#39;s an observation.     the only &#39;progression&#39; was the fucking explosive charges going off demolishing the columns all at once you dolt.    why do you think buildings are demolished, rather than a few fires set randomly and wait for the inevitable?  what a joke. </p>

<p>go for it.   of course it makes more sense to examine evidence for the most obvious cause - not the one that you have to handwave like NIST and fudge the data to get a result that isn&#39;t even close.  </p>

<p>Lets get a sample of the dust and do the experiment,  I know how to run it. We can compare against other samples of known thermitic content.  </p>

<p>Like this: </p>

<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_T2gpIK0VzFw/TIuoHpu2r0I/AAAAAAAAAu0/ogp5-FDfaco/s1600/DSCs_comparative2010-08-28_17-22-49.jpg">http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_T2gpIK0VzFw/TIuoHpu2r0I/AAAAAAAAAu0/ogp5-FDfaco/s1600/DSCs_comparative2010-08-28_17-22-49.jpg</a>  </p>

<p>see that peak, the blue one?  it&#39;s a highly energetic exotherm.  much better than even the substance it&#39;s compared to.   it means when you heat this substance that it becomes highly exothermic.   paint chips don&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>of course, because you only believe in the official conspiracy based on authority that you&#39;d need another authority to tell you the science is valid.  </p>

<p>the great thing about science is, you can repeat the experiment yourself. and confirm it.   go ahead.  I&#39;m well satisfied with the methodology and techniques - also the chain of custody of the samples.   I bet there are plenty of samples you could have analylzed - run DSC on the red/gray chips and observe the iron microspheres formed on ignition.    Slam dunk.</p>

<p>So is this you citing your expertise? I really would love the input of an expert. I know that it is a bit much to ask you to send me proof of your expertise, but I know <a href="/r/science">/r/science</a> flairs people who have college degree. I would be willing to accept you getting flair there in the appropriate field as evidence of your knowledge on the topic.</p>

<p>I actually can&#39;t. I don&#39;t have a sample of the dust, the skills necessary to test the dust, or the knowledge to interpret the results. This is why I really want to be sure you have this knowledge before I take what you say to heart.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The substance is either in the dust or it isn&#39;t</p>

<p>Totally. 100% agree on this point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Get a sample and have the experiments repeated</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would love to, but I don&#39;t have a sample of the dust, or the experimental know how. Do you have a sample of the dust?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s science</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Science also allows for us to evaluate evidence provided by others. That&#39;s what I am proposing we do, in the absence of a fresh sample of dust. So are you agreeing with the claims in the article I linked earlier? <a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/essays/thermite/explosive_residues.html">This</a> one? I just want to know what you&#39;re claiming precisely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Isn&#39;t this is a large flaw though? From what I am reading, the lower ignition temperature and subsequent burning in an atmosphere is consistent with the paint burning. </p>

<p>Additionally, you say that burning paint is not consistent with the DSC results. Have we taken a sample of the paint-primer mix used in the towers and compared that against the DSC of the chips? Or do we even have a graph of the DSC results of ANY paint compared against the chips?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To move me to an agnostic stance, you would need to either poke holes in my theory (that the towers collapsed due to fires and being hit by planes) or show strong evidence for a competing theory to a level that it becomes more viable than the alternative. </p>

<p>Poking holes in my theory is straight forward, simply take a look at the analyses by NIST and show how they couldn&#39;t have happened, either with computer models or mathematics. </p>

<p>To give evidence for a competing theory, my primary stopping points are the lack of conclusive evidence for explosives (no seismograph evidence of detonations, no well conducted experiments of the &quot;thermite&quot; in the dust, no feasible way to rig the buildings with explosives) and the sheer breadth of the conspiracy. </p>

<p>However, if you can give me conclusive evidence of explosives or thermite, I will gladly take at least an agnostic stance on the whole issue. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, here&#39;s what I can deduce from the links.</p>

<p>The Szuladzinski paper tried to say some of the assumptions made in the Bazant papers are wrong. I am not sure if this is correct or not. I understand the physics in the paper, but I am not skilled enough in engineering to be able to say whether those assumptions are wrong. The reason I am not sure of the paper is mainly the journal they chose. They didn&#39;t try to write a letter to the editors of the original Bazant paper, and didn&#39;t try (or tried and got rejected) from the journal Bazant published in. Instead, the published in a journal that I can&#39;t even find an impact factor for. </p>

<p>However, all of this being said, I will gladly step back to an agnostic stance on the Bazant paper. To convince me they&#39;re wrong, I&#39;d like to see publications in more serious journals. </p>
