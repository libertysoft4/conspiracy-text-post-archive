<p>Sounds like treason.  Is it legal to say or try it?  As if Obama is radically different from Jeb&#39;s brother or father.  Was it a stunt to create the impression of political diversity?  Alex Jones provided the only news coverage of this oddity, the liberal media ignored it.</p>

<p>These guys are just extremely ideological. Practical real world considerations that there is little differences between the parties and candidates and polices don&#39;t matter, image and projection and that basic fact that they&#39;re not the ones doing it are what is so important and why they&#39;ve been so hysterical about Obama. This is about keeping the party faithful in a frenzy for the next election.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh please.  Any student of world governments is familiar with this term &quot;shadow government&quot;--it simply means a structured political opposition.  For instance, in the UK the minority party in parliament forms a &quot;shadow cabinet&quot; which corresponds in opposition to the majority government. For each gov. minister, there is a shadow minister.</p>

<p>You and so many other dilettantes here should dedicate just some of the time you spend watching YouTube videos on actually educating yourselves on these issues and not assume that your inane hunches and half-cocked theories are worth putting out there until you&#39;ve done some homework. </p>

<p>Only... it&#39;s not. You&#39;re mixing the various uses of term &#39;shadow government&#39;. Yes, there&#39;s the Westminster shadow government which is an opposition government, but that isn&#39;t what this is. And this isn&#39;t a &#39;separate&#39; government either, as far as I can tell anyway.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Deployed &quot;on the fly&quot; in the first hours of turmoil on Sept. 11, one participant said, the shadow government has evolved into an indefinite precaution. For that reason, the <strong>high-ranking officials representing their departments have begun rotating in and out of the assignment at one of two fortified locations</strong> along the East Coast. Rotation is among several changes made in late October or early November, sources said, to the standing directive Bush inherited from a line of presidents reaching back to Dwight D. Eisenhower. </p>

<p>Officials who are activated for what some of them call &quot;bunker duty&quot; live and work underground 24 hours a day, away from their families. As it settles in for the long haul, the shadow government has sent home most of the first wave of deployed personnel, replacing them most commonly at 90-day intervals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With the key part being &quot;high-ranking officials representing their departments have begun rotating in and out of the assignment at one of two fortified locations&quot;. It&#39;s literally a &#39;shadow&#39; of the government. Not an opposition. Not a separate government.</p>

<p>They just take a handful of high-ranking existing members of the government and shove them in bunkers for a while, they perform exactly the same work they would have performed before in Washington, only in a different place.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not like the shadow government is just random people picked in a way that avoids the way the normal US government functions, they&#39;ve already been picked, they&#39;re just moved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So my opinion will most likely be somewhat unpopular but I believe every nation needs some form of COG (Continuity of Government) plan in place. </p>

<p>Given the history of the United States and utter lack of concern for not only their citizens but those of other nations I&#39;m more that somewhat dubious about what form this would be realized. </p>

<p>But, I think many of us here realize that if TSHTF (<em>and it&#39;s probably only matter of time</em>) having some level of officials in place could mitigate even further chaos. In my mind the focus on those individuals would be less top heavy and more middle heavy. Examples would include the right people administrators, engineers, etc. to keep basic health services running, the national energy infrastructure and other similar services critical to basic human needs. </p>

<p>Again, not letting the US off on some of the creepy plans they have on the books but I do think a shadow government or COG plan if you&#39;d like to call it that are necessary. I&#39;d be rather disappointed if there wasn&#39;t some forethought and planning for a really shitty future rainy day on a scale affecting millions.</p>

<p>Also, I believe all but the most key officials of said parallel government should be publicly known. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Er, no, that would defy the entire point of a government continuity plan.</p>

<p>If you say &quot;Yeah, if this guy dies he&#39;d be replaced by this guy&quot; then you&#39;d just plan to kill off as many replacements as you know of since eventually you&#39;ll run out.</p>

<p>Most government&#39;s continuity plan&#39;s aren&#39;t made public for exactly this reason.</p>

<p>For the UK some members of the government started complaining that a clear continuity plan should be made in case the Prime Minister, or multiple members of the government, died. The Cabinet Office said it was &quot;not going to discuss a hypothetical situation&quot;, and more importantly added:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Suffice to say, the appropriate arrangements would be in place to ensure the smooth running of government</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that any plans put in place for succession by a party, like having a deputy Prime Minister would &quot;not constrain the sovereign&#39;s power to appoint a successor to a prime minister&quot;.</p>

<p>Essentially if the entire government is somehow killed off then there is a plan for succession. It&#39;s just that the plan isn&#39;t public. And if a party says &quot;We&#39;d like to put these people in power&quot; then... oh well, the continuity plan is superior.</p>

<p>Same holds true for most countries I&#39;ve tried to find this information for.</p>

<p>The most that&#39;s been made public is what happens if the head of office dies/is killed. The plans for a massive attack targeting the government are never really made completely public.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except shadow governments, and especially the one here, exist solely to leach off the state. It is not benevolent, and cannot by nature be. It has no accountability, and does the sorts of things unaccountable people do. Only that which will benefit its own growth at all costs and with no morality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Er, no, that would defy the entire point of a government continuity plan.</p>

<p>If you say &quot;Yeah, if this guy dies he&#39;d be replaced by this guy&quot; then you&#39;d just plan to kill off as many replacements as you know of since eventually you&#39;ll run out.</p>

<p>Most government&#39;s continuity plan&#39;s aren&#39;t made public for exactly this reason.</p>

<p>For the UK some members of the government started complaining that a clear continuity plan should be made in case the Prime Minister, or multiple members of the government, died. The Cabinet Office said it was &quot;not going to discuss a hypothetical situation&quot;, and more importantly added:</p>
