<p>I see people deny it a lot here, what&#39;s the conspiracy behind it? The greenhouse effect is so simple. Greenhouse gasses are trapped, warming the planet, humans release more and more over time, having a dangerous effect on our climate. Millions die from pollution in China alone. This is a very unhealthy future for humanity.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve noticed that links denying it get 100+ upvotes, but proof the opposite way gets hardly any. Is this one of those conspiracies that is spread simply because it goes against the &#39;mainstream&#39; idea? Or is it about government regulation? </p>

<p>I&#39;m just curious because my stepdad denies it as well. If I show him evidence he doesn&#39;t really care/prove me wrong. He&#39;s not a conspiracy theorist or anything. To be fair, I think he just has fun annoying me at this point.</p>

<p>Would like some input, TY. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I struggle taking Carson seriously. In his last appearance on the JRE (with Hancock) he spent about 20 minutes trying to explain how mass extinction events that timed with human migration into these regions were unrelated to human activity despite this being a pretty well established narrative. He raised the example of there being no such mass extinction in Africa without mentioning that uh... we evolved with all those animals and that presumably they became adapted to recognize us as a danger before our numbers started expanding. Whilst I&#39;m not a climate scientist, I find many of his statements on climate change equally dubious. </p>

<p>Anyway onto some points: </p>

<ul>
<li>The global climate is an <em>incredibly</em> complicated system. Unsurprisingly computer models and theoretical analysis cannot encompass more than a small fraction of the variables involved. As we don&#39;t have a good holistic understanding of this system we do not know which variables are truly important and which are just co-incidental. </li>
<li>The Carbon Cycle is incredibly important for sure. What is important here though is not the <em>amount</em> we put in, but whether or not man-made emissions cause this cycle to fall out of balance. We know reasonably reliably that there is a fairly fixed limit to how much CO2 can be absorbed each year. Logically then it is not the amount of CO2 but how much <em>excess</em> CO2 there is. Producing 6bln tonnes, as you say, is peanuts compared to the natural turnover however is this 6bln tonnes cannot be accommodated by natural cycles then it is simply going to build up over time. </li>
<li>It is completely right to say that historically many &#39;golden eras&#39; have coincided with climatic warm periods however it should also be noted that each of these golden eras has resulted in catastrophic collapse when the warm period has ended. Is this a model we want to follow? Is it even relevant with the dawn of modern agriculture? I doubt it. Also worth noting that yes plants can operate more efficiently with a slightly higher atmospheric CO2 content however it does not follow a linear trend, too much CO2 and the plants (as well as most animals!) begin to suffer harm. </li>
</ul>

</blockquote>

<p>Well you have a good imagination at least ;) Where did I mention &#39;super-hurricanes&#39;? Like in the other thread you are putting words in my mouth and arguing from that. I don&#39;t like it. Extreme weather is unseasonable, unusual, or severe weather. It could include the changes in crop growth patterns due to unseasonably warm/cold/wet/dry seasons etc. Just because it isn&#39;t dramatic doesn&#39;t mean there isn&#39;t an issue. And again as I said in my OP here this is an <em>incredibly</em> complicated system we are talking about here, it&#39;s silly to try and assign specific weather events to climate change which is why the focus tends to be far more on longer-term trends. </p>

<p>Are you implying that the animals which first encountered humans were not afraid of them and therefore easy to hunt?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No I&#39;m saying that a creature which can use tools to kill over a distance is fairly unusual in nature. The development and evolution of <a href="http://www.vnews.com/home/7275690-95/editorial-evolutionary-advantage-the-arm-gave-us-a-leg-up">throwing weapons</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/13/science/13fish.html">trapping</a> are thought to have been key events in human evolution. What equivalent would a giant sloth in America have to understand that those small pinkish things wrapped in dead-fur might be dangerous? These humans would have had <em>hundreds of thousands of years</em> worth of foreknowledge in terms of hunting techniques. The animals would have little if any instinctive response to such hunting techniques. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So we just killed for fun back than and not for food</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anatomically modern humans would presumably have thought-patterns and motives that remain understandable (if not wholly applicable) to culturally modern humans. Humans today hunt for sport and entertainment ergo it seems likely humans in the past would have similar motives. If you can <a href="http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/158">kill a whole herd</a> of animals as easily as you can kill a single animal, why not kill them all? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The thing about things being &quot;a pretty well established narrative&quot; is insofar not a good argument.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I completely agree! Sadly though we are dealing with pre-historic history here, solid conclusions are hard to come-by. We have strong correlation between human migration and mass-extinction events. We have archaeological records of large-scale hunts. From these two points we are drawing a hazy conclusion. That&#39;s all. But yes you are right, apologies if I sound like I am trying to state this as &#39;fact&#39; in any way I am just trying to present the &#39;standard&#39; argument here because...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Scientific truth</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no truth. Honest. I&#39;m all for re-interpreting archaeological finds and trying to create a new narrative which accounts for the inconsistencies with the standard models as per Hancock&#39;s work but I feel Carson <em>often</em> takes this several steps too far, making truth claims about very hazy pieces of evidence from the long-distant past. At least when it comes to anthropology he does anyway. Anyway in terms of other &#39;alternative history&#39; theories I&#39;d love to recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKP9ru_G5vk">Deek Jackson</a>, I really liked his analysis :)   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If we want to change it as a whole, wouldn&#39;t an understanding of the whole system be a much better approach to implement meaningful and effective change?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes I completely agree. I think to a point this goes back to what you were saying about ideology. The &#39;CO2 causes climate change&#39; narrative is extremely easy to understand from a layperson&#39;s perspective and is <em>technically true</em> even if it is <strong>far</strong> from the whole picture. I don&#39;t think it is as nefarious as many dissenters often seem to suggest but yes I would much rather the discussion were more complex and nuanced. That said though it seems hard enough to get the general public off the topic of celebrity culture so... y&#39;know compromises and all that xD That said I&#39;m also not a climate scientist so I am not &#39;in touch&#39; with that field. For all I know, the actual academic discussion behind the public announcements is actually very nuanced but they choose to stick to a simplified narrative for the sake of maximizing public reaction? I dunno man. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>we humans merely adapt to changing circumstances which just happen to suit us very well</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes I think this is exactly the case. Jarred Diamond&#39;s book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collapse:_How_Societies_Choose_to_Fail_or_Succeed"><em>&#39;Collapse&#39;</em></a> (and <em>Guns, Germs and Steel</em> to a lesser extent) goes into some detail on this. The thing is that was the past. I like to think/hope that modern societies are capable of appreciating our place in the world and taking steps to ensure longer-term survival/prosperity. Undoubtedly the technology and resources we have at our disposal today out-shadows <em>anything</em> from the past. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you have more info on this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah sure, <a href="http://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/effects-of-rising-atmospheric-concentrations-of-carbon-13254108">this article</a> is the best summary I can find with a quick search. Basically increasing the CO2 consumption of a plant generally increases metabolic rate as a whole. tl:dr is basically you start to run into <em>numerous</em> limiting factors. The plants might be <em>bigger</em> but the proteins and carbohydrates responsible for giving function are not always able to keep up. Also many issues in terms of soil depletion, over-consumption of water etc. etc. Eventually you also run into the point at which the partial pressure of CO2 becomes so great that you inhibit aerobic respiration but that&#39;s a bit of a moot point as everything else would also start to die by that point :v </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Rockefellers and many of the foundations sponsored by the elite had a set of agendas they wanted enacted.</p>

<p>A world government, fewer people, control of resources.</p>

<p>There are some other agendas, but we can start with these. To make their agenda a reality, they pursued many means of population control, many ways to bring about a world government and basically already had resource control. </p>

<p>CO2 is exhaled by all people and is part of each and every human transaction. There are methods to avoid it, power sources that don&#39;t produce CO2, but they are not discussed by the global warming crowd.</p>

<p>Exxon is now being portrayed as the &quot;bad guy&quot; in global warming. This is true, but not how the media tells it. Exxon published 53 papers supporting AGW. Exxon belonged to the Rockefellers and they were driving the message of AGW through Exxon and other resources. </p>

<p>It&#39;s important to understand the depths of the Rockefellers influence and connections. At the turn of the 20th century, the Rockefellers took over the American Medical Association and made it into what it is today. They took a bunch of everyday Joes and made the idea of a doctor as a status symbol, highly paid and godlike. They simultaneously ensured that diseases would be treated rather than cured and the pharmaceutical companies treating the diseases would be Rockefeller companies. </p>

<p>People couldn&#39;t become doctors without the AMA, they could be dismissed from the AMA for curing people.</p>

<p>They did kind of the same with climate science. The history of climate science is a bunch of people jumping on board with the current trend and not being able to explain it, with some being extremely alarmed about it. This happened during the dust bowl, the 50s to the seventies were a scare of global cooling, and then the uptick in temperature came about and a new thing to jump on board and cause alarm over was put in place. But this time the Rockefellers were there.</p>

<p>The Rockefellers of course provided the land and helped the UN get started as the follow up to the League of Nations which they also got started. Both these groups essentially were moves towards a world government.</p>

<p>Maurice Strong started the IPCC and gave them their raison d&#39;être: find human influence on the environment. Maurice Strong was a high school drop out, from Canada, who found himself living in the apartment of a wealthy and influential New Yorker at the age of 19. He was introduced to the Rockefellers and went into the oil business. He helped make Canada dependent on foreign oil and then was put in charge of PetroCanada to get Canada independent from foreign oil.</p>

<p>And then just as the uptick in temperature occurs, he becomes:</p>

<p>Secretary General of both the 1972 United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, which launched the world environment movement, and the 1992 Rio Environmental Summit, he was the first Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He establishes the IPCC and then 600 scientists are set to work to determine &quot;man&#39;s influence in the climate&quot; during a warming period.</p>

<p>Man&#39;s influence was then obviously to warm the climate and CO2 was a good scapegoat for the cause. People make lots of it, it in fact encompasses every facet of human life.</p>

<p>So they rolled with CO2. </p>

<p>The next step is to get the world to start funding the problem. All that we need to do is fund this world body with a payment from every aspect of our life and also give them the ability to enforce. Enforce against every aspect of our life.</p>

<p>The Rockefellers turned climate scientists into many superstars with very good salaries. And anyone who goes against their story is attacked all around. Only few older scientists are willing to cross them. Young scientists who object to the theory just don&#39;t get hired.</p>

<p>The models have been completely wrong. Antartica&#39;s ice is growing. No hotspots were found, the temperature hasn&#39;t risen in 18 years of the greatest CO2 output, there is no past evidence of CO2 driving warming.</p>

<p>And you can see from the truly &quot;religious&quot; believers in global warming what their sentiments are (many leading advocates for global warming have instructed their followers to &quot;stay on message&quot; i.e. don&#39;t say shit like:) &quot;I&#39;m not going to have kids&quot;, &quot;Humans deserve to die&quot;, &quot;Deniers should be imprisoned&quot;.</p>

<p>Anyways, we have 25% energy poverty in my province. Last year the models predicted a &quot;mild&quot; winter with &quot;high confidence&quot;, it turned out to break the record for the coldest winter, broke the snow record, was what many contractors for snow removal based their prices on and got screwed for. </p>

<p>Their policies and belief in their models which have never been right cause havoc. Less access to energy and people taking taxes for CO2 will certainly result in terrible consequences. But they&#39;ve prepped their faithful for this. Part of studying climate change is to go through moral dilemmas where they basically tell you to save humanity you need to be willing to kill most of it.</p>

<p>The thing that makes it most obvious are their lack of solutions. Thorium can prove a thousand years of energy with no CO2 emissions, but they won&#39;t mention it. Biofuel is supposed to be producing 3000 gallons per acre of marginal land, but gets no mention. </p>

<p>I could go through a long list of technologies that exist and are competitive but are not promoted. </p>

<p>An interesting example is Lomberg. First, I completely disagree with his ideas, but the funny thing is he completely agrees with the premise that CO2 causes warming, but suggests that trillions of dollars aren&#39;t necessary to deal with it.</p>

<p>For that, he is called a denier. He proposes solutions, and so he is a denier.</p>

<p>Climate Change is the apocalypse for athirst/would be scientists. And to say it can be prevented is sacrilege. </p>

<p>That&#39;s the basic story of climate change.</p>

<p>This is probably the main reason, I agree. There is a loose global elite that want to consolidate their power by abolishing nation states. The League of Nations, the United Nations, the European Union etc have all been introduced to this end, albeit without much success. The elite have now decided they need to convince the world there is a &quot;common enemy&quot; that could destroy the planet, and this will bring countries together under a single planet-state. </p>

<p>For a long time, it was thought that the threat of an alien attack (or even a hoax alien invasion) might be used to implement a world government, but for the time being the elite have chosen another (still bullshit, but less idiotic) &quot;threat&quot; - namely <strong>ecological and climatic catastrophe</strong>. This ploy has been quite successful - billions of people have fallen for this unscientific propaganda, and the recent global elite jamboree in Paris shows that the elite may be starting to get their way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are so naive. Are you seriously pointing to &quot;Hurricane Patricia&quot; as your basis for thinking the whole climate change is a hoax? </p>

<p>The Climate Change calamity coming our way is not confirmed by just ONE method of temperature measurement. There are now dozens and dozens of different ways of measuring the climate, from satellite, to ground-level temp measuring stations--more every day. Every single one of these methods are pointing to the same thing: our climate is getting warm at an alarming rate. Why should you care? Because CO2 does its magic and then it releases Methane gas from the frozen Arctic sea floor, and from the vast Siberian permafrost. Methane is at least 30 times more severe as a greenhouse gas. </p>

<p>This could--serious as a heart attack--kill all of us by 2030. I know that sound crazy.</p>

The last few years have been the mildest when it comes to hurricanes despite every model predicting the opposite. I have lived in various states on the east coast for the last 20 years and it is clearly observable that there is no sea level rise. The fact that the weatherman can&#39;t predict beyond a week (sometimes even a day) with any accuracy makes it clear how much more complex the issue is than one molecule with a bad reputation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The number 2030 was put forward by professor Guy McPherson, a Climate Scientist who has been studying this issue for  about 45 years. 
McPherson has two sites: <a href="http://guymcpherson.com/">Nature Bats Last</a> and <a href="http://www.onlyloveremains.org/">Abrupt Climate Change</a>. He studied the question of Methane Hydrates, which are frozen on the floor of the Arctic and in Siberian Permafrost. In case you&#39;re not aware, Methane is 30 times worse as a green house gas than CO2 is. CO2 emissions have permitted the elimination of Arctic sea ice, thereby allowing the current huge spike in Methane emissions from the Arctic. </p>

<p>The year 2030 for complete human extinction is elaborated by Guy McPherson when he is interviewed extensively in this program:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe8enxF6ip0">Look for the Wow moment</a></p>

<p>I assure you this is not just another crop of bullshit.

There now exists a group called the <a href="http://ameg.me/">Arctic Methane Emergency Group</a>. If this were bullshit, why would somebody have bothered to spend the money and dedicate the time to creating something called the <a href="http://ameg.me/"><strong>Arctic Methane Emergency Group</strong></a>?)</p>

<p>I really do not care if you cannot comprehend the science or math behind this issue. As people like me are trying to slap you in the face with something you need to know, you can go on being entertained--like a clown or a mental defective who just doesn&#39;t get it--but this global calamity heading our way will keep coming.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to the satellite data (the most accurate record we have on global climate) there has been no extreme warming for the past 18+ years (it&#39;s in the 10ths of a degree which is quite OK). It really makes me wonder where people are coming from when actual scientific observation is disregarded in favour of preserving a political ideology.</p>

<p>The Arctic, Greenland and Antarctica are all breaking records for ice accumulation, sea ice extent, shortest melt seasons etc. We&#39;ve seen normal sea level rise, which has been rising steadily since the end of the last ice age about 10,000 years ago. Hurricanes, cyclones, monsoons are all in decline and the climate isn&#39;t rising at an alarming rate.</p>

<p>All this, and more, in spite of rising levels of CO2. It seems that nature just doesn&#39;t want to play ball with the UN and its anthropogenic climate alarmism. Seriously, if you&#39;re getting your news from Arnold and Bill Nye (who doesn&#39;t know shit about the climate FYI, Richard Lindzen is an atmospheric physicist from MIT) you&#39;re not helping yourself or anyone else.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve seen a 40% greening of the planet, crop yields are up and the plants are loving it. CO2 only exists in the atmosphere at a level of around 0.04%. Of that very small amount only 3% is man made. Heck, ants all over the world produce ten times more CO2 than humans do each year. Is ant CO2 good but human CO2 bad?</p>

<p>Did you know that if CO2 levels dropped to 150ppm all plant life on the planet dies? By all estimates, before humans came along and started putting CO2 back into the atmosphere, from whence it came, the planet only had about 2 millions years left before reaching that catastrophic level. Levels of CO2 are still less than 400ppm, which is less than ideal for plants to flourish. As an example, owners of agricultural greenhouses pump in extra CO2 up to levels of 1,200ppm so that plants will grow more efficiently and with higher yields.</p>

<p>The UN is an unelected political body that is using anthropogenic global warming as a means to change the world order and accrue power unto itself. Their Sustainable Development document, which I have read in its entirety, is nothing short of a blueprint to establish a technocratic socialist world order. It&#39;s a centrally planned nightmare. If the 20th century is anything to go by, this new version of global socialism will cause way more harm than good. Central planning and socialism in general just doesn&#39;t work.</p>

<p>I have also taken the time to download and analyse John Cook&#39;s 97% scientific consensus paper with the data. It&#39;s a scam. That guy, who lives just up the road from me, literally, faked that consensus. There was nothing like the consensus he claimed there was. In fact, based upon his data, it&#39;s more like a 0.3% consensus if you don&#39;t group unrelated categories or include papers that have nothing to do with AGW. If you knew anything you would know that the only place you&#39;ll find a scientific consensus is at the UN. The Petition Project, where 31,487 scientists have signed a document stating that AGW is not real, refutes the consensus claim, as does the survey conducted by the Scottish, Climate &amp; Energy Forum.</p>

<p>You criticise us deniers as loons and immovable but we&#39;re, at least, prepared to take time out of our days to actually look into the data. Are you? If you&#39;re willing, maybe a good place to start is to research why that bloomberg page linked above is nothing but climate alarmist propaganda. Also, typically, climate sceptics have had their minds changed at least once, so to say they can&#39;t change their minds is also silly. I used to believe in AGW until I started asking questions and looking for answers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>CO2 acts as a strong coolant in the upper atmosphere. For roughly 250 kms (it fluctuates) the incoming energy from the sun is prevented from reaching the planet by CO2.</p>

<p>This is not in dispute. </p>

<p>The energy then hits the earth, clouds, and is absorbed and reradiated. </p>

<p>In the biosphere, it doesn&#39;t warm. In the region dominated by water, it doesn&#39;t warm.</p>

<p>Above the area dominated by clouds it absorbs some of the otherwise out-going radiation. This is a very narrow band. </p>

<p>What the overall effect is has not been determined. NASA isn&#39;t clear:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2010/15jul_thermosphere/">http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2010/15jul_thermosphere/</a></p>

<p>When carbon dioxide gets into the thermosphere, it acts as a coolant, shedding heat via infrared radiation. It is widely-known that CO2 levels have been increasing in Earth&#39;s atmosphere. Extra CO2 in the thermosphere could have magnified the cooling action of solar minimum.</p>

<p>&quot;But the numbers don&#39;t quite add up,&quot; says Emmert. &quot;Even when we take CO2 into account using our best understanding of how it operates as a coolant, we cannot fully explain the thermosphere&#39;s collapse.&quot;</p>

<p>According to Emmert and colleagues, low solar EUV accounts for about 30% of the collapse. Extra CO2 accounts for at least another 10%. That leaves as much as 60% unaccounted for.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, extra CO2 results in cooling but how much is unknown.</p>

<p>How does CO2 in the upper atmosphere compare to models? Models predicted half the rate of increase that observational measurements later determined. In other words, that  &quot;Extra CO2 accounts for at least another 10%&quot; means that the models at least half of that cooling effect as an error, with the potential for much more.</p>

<p>In NASA&#39;s AMA, I asked about the extent of the cooling effect of CO2 in the upper atmosphere. This article is quite old and the only further research I&#39;ve found from NASA suggests the effect is quite significant:</p>

<p>The conclusion was (from the first link):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Important clues may be found in the way the thermosphere rebounds. Solar minimum is now coming to an end, EUV radiation is on the rise, and the thermosphere is puffing up again. Exactly how the recovery proceeds could unravel the contributions of solar vs. terrestrial sources.</p>

<p>&quot;We will continue to monitor the situation,&quot; says Emmett.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 2012, we found out from NASA:</p>

<p><a href="http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2012/22mar_saber/">http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2012/22mar_saber/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“This was the biggest dose of heat we’ve received from a solar storm since 2005,” says Martin Mlynczak of NASA Langley Research Center.  “It was a big event, and shows how solar activity can directly affect our planet.”</p>

<p>For the three day period, March 8th through 10th, the thermosphere absorbed 26 billion kWh of energy.  Infrared radiation from CO2 and NO, the two most efficient coolants in the thermosphere, re-radiated 95% of that total back into space.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, that seems quite informative, but as I said, I asked NASA about it in their AMA, perhaps their direct reply is of more use?</p>

<p>The comment, linking to the same site, NASA&#39;s, using a direct quote from NASA, asked to NASA, with a request that they expand on it, was automodded. During that important time when comments first appear on the thread, it is shadow banned, automatically according to the mod who approved it one hour later.</p>

<p>It still attracted attention and rose to smack dab in the middle of the voted up questions. NASA chose to answer the following questions, but not this one. </p>

<p>In other words, don&#39;t just listen to people saying CO2 warms the atmosphere. It shields us to a certain extent to the full force of the sun, and what gets through is then slightly held back in a small region.</p>

<p>Does that mean that CO2 in the atmosphere causes cooling overall? Since we can&#39;t even mention that it causes cooling without a flock of alarmists descending on us, it will be hard to determine. Where do the politics lie at NASA?</p>

<p>Exactly. Even if anthropogenic contributions are tiny compared to natural turnover, if it causes CO2 output to exceed what natural cycling systems can cope with then there is an issue.

<p>I haven&#39;t mentioned pollution at all but yes I agree that it is a shame so much attention is placed on CO2 <strong>however</strong> most of the CO2-producing processes we usually associate with ACC (transport, industry etc.) also produce tremendous quantities of harmful pollution therefore I don&#39;t feel it&#39;s really fair to make the distinction you are making. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The graph shows temperature vs CO2 levels for the last 400,000 years.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the exact graph that I was shown in climate change courses. I will tell you what I found out online (and what made me become suspicious of &quot;global warming&quot;, a theory I just assumed was true). The professors said, CO2 goes up, temperature goes up. But that&#39;s not what&#39;s happening. Temperature goes up and then 800 years later, CO2 goes up.</p>

<p>In other words, warmer temperature causes more growth. But, they use it to say, look how closely related they are (and don&#39;t mention the 800 year gap following warming)!</p>

<p>It&#39;s like someone looking at a horse-drawn carriage and saying the carriage is what&#39;s making the horses move.</p>

<p>So for the last 400,000 years, temperature increases caused CO2 increases. What about recently? CO2 increases were met by:</p>

<p>cooling,</p>

<p>warming,</p>

<p>no change.</p>

<p>That does&#39;t sound very convincing for CO2 to cause warming, maybe if we go way back we can see some connection?</p>

<p><a href="http://deforestation.geologist-1011.net/PhanerozoicCO2-Temperatures.png">http://deforestation.geologist-1011.net/PhanerozoicCO2-Temperatures.png</a></p>

<p>Nope, no connection. So CO2 didn&#39;t correlate with temperature for most of history, followed warming, and now doesn&#39;t correlate with warming in modern history.</p>

<p>It takes an extremely biased person to glean from these graphs that CO2 causes warming. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We don&#39;t really know as much as we act like we do.</p>

<p>For example, a few years back, NASA printed a few articles on the thermosphere&#39;s collapse and couldn&#39;t explain it by what was understood to be the cooling effect of CO2 in the upper atmosphere alone. </p>

<p>CO2 increases in the upper atmosphere were double the rate predicted by the models. This means that we don&#39;t really understand the balance.</p>

<p>We also don&#39;t really understand the effects of the biosphere very well. Would reforesting a desert cause warming or cooling? TBH, we don&#39;t really know. </p>

<p>Most of the studies done into deforestation often take a model predicted CO2 forcing rate. These have shown to be over-predictions, but then they base the studies on them. We have different studies with different results for water vapours effect on CO2, with some saying the effect is negative and some saying positive, but the models had based it on having a positive feedback and the studies adopted this. </p>

<p>In other words, we do know, but it&#39;s contrary to our narrative. Forests cause warming. We&#39;ve known it for quite a while.</p>

<p>But then NASA comes and does their climate change AMA and when asked about just planting vast forests to sequester CO2, NASA basically hedges and doesn&#39;t get into it. Because forests are green and climate change is a green movement, so they just ignore the issue.</p>

<p>The same with nuclear. The same group who supported it is all up in the climate change videos, at the rallies, and add to their numbers.</p>

<p>Nuclear is not only the safest power source, it doesn&#39;t give off CO2.</p>

<p>If their movement is more important than the science, then it&#39;s not about the science, but about the movement.</p>

<p>I have seen no strong evidence to suggest that CO2 levels correlate with warming. All major hypotheses have failed to materialize.</p>

<p>Oh man. You are completely out of line with this comment.

<p>You, on the other hand, have a post history on this sub of less than two weeks and post almost entirely about Israel. You may not be a shill, but calling out untumulted as a shill with a two week history of posting in this sub is out of line. And you couldn&#39;t be more wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Millions die from pollution in China alone. This is a very unhealthy future for humanity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pollution is obviously a problem and, of course, we should be trying to get ourselves off fossil fuels. But there is no scientific experiment that proves CO2 emissions are responsible for Global Warming. Climate Change is statistical analysis, it is not science. If I am wrong, please explain the methodology of the experiment that proves CO2 is directly responsible for the increase of global temperature.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but proof the opposite way gets hardly any</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What proof? There is only &quot;scientific consensus&quot;. Consensus IS NOT science. Once upon a time, there was consensus that the Earth was flat and that the Earth was the center of the Universe. Do you know what the scientific gatekeepers called Galileo and Copernicus? &quot;Deniers&quot;. </p>

<p>That being said, I believe that CO2 is a huge pollution problem and for that alone we need to get off fossil fuels. But remember, if the Government and Elite think that climate change is seriously a &quot;national security threat&quot;, then why are there still <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title35/pdf/USCODE-2011-title35-partII-chap17-sec181.pdf">3000 renewable energy patents classified by the patent office?</a> Wouldn&#39;t you think they&#39;d release new energy devices to the public and subsidize them? Wouldn&#39;t you think they&#39;d stop subsidizing the Oil companies in favor of renewable energy? </p>

<p>Furthermore, think about the solution being presented. The only &quot;solution&quot; to the problem anyone is talking about is a <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122826696217574539">Global Carbon Tax</a>. So if that gets passed, the UN will have a brand new bureaucracy that collects taxes from Americans and a bunch of other countries. For all intents and purposes, we will be beholden to a new form of government that will collect taxes and make decisions about our industry and the industry of many other countries. The UN will be able to stop small countries from developing their industry if it is deemed that they are producing too much Carbon. This is about control, not saving the world. Will we be able to vote on the people making decisions in this new government? Of course not. No taxation without representation.</p>

<p>&quot;Climate Change&quot; is a smoke screen being used to set up a new form of government. They are playing on everyone&#39;s heart strings and humanity to trick people into paying a new tax that <em>will not do anything</em>. Do you think Climate Change would just magically reverse course and everything would then be cool? Of course it wouldn&#39;t be in reality but the MSM would start reporting &quot;We&#39;ve saved the world! We&#39;ve done it! No need to worry about Climate Change anymore because now you&#39;re paying taxes directly to the UN and now the problem is solved.&quot; Meanwhile the Oil companies will continue to receive their subsidies, pollution will continue to get worse and worse, and all the inventions that could change the world will remain suppressed and hidden in the black projects going on in the bottom levels of S4 and Area 51.</p>

<p>And how do you analyse the results of an experiment?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t believe you are a scientist after this comment. What field of study are you in and what do you do?</p>

<p>The scientific method is this: </p>

<ol>
<li>Form a Hypothesis </li>
<li>Develop testable predictions</li>
<li>Experiment</li>
<li>Check results against predictions</li>
<li>Form further hypotheses and repeat.</li>
</ol>

<p>Examples of this include the Double Slit Experiment, Galileo&#39;s falling objects, the Cavendish Experiment, Foucault&#39;s Pendulum, etc. etc. etc. All of these experiments are repeatable and prove beyond a shadow of a doubt a certain aspect of reality. There is no equivalent to any of these for Climate Change. Climate Change is simply the laying of two graphs over one another, a correlation, and then &quot;97%&quot; (made up number) of scientists agreeing &quot;Yes! We all have a consensus that correlation DOES equal causation in this instance!&quot; That&#39;s not science, that&#39;s the bastardization of science.</p>

<p>But you are right about one thing: so much of the &quot;science&quot; nowadays is actually just bullshit statistical analysis. Most of it is also not repeatable. Have you ever heard of the Lancet Journal of Science (it&#39;s a pretty big one right?). This is what the editor of that journal had to say about the current state of science <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736%2815%2960696-1.pdf">CITE</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The case against science is straightforward: much of the scientific literature, perhaps half, may simply be untrue. Afflicted by studies with small sample sizes, tiny effects, invalid exploratory analyses, and flagrant conflicts of interest, together with an obsession for pursuing fashionable trends of dubious importance, science has taken a turn towards darkness....</p>

<p>It is simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published, or to rely on the judgment of trusted physicians or authoritative medical guidelines. I take no pleasure in this conclusion, which I reached slowly and reluctantly over my two decades as an editor of the New England Journal of Medicine</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The state of science in America is profoundly flawed at the moment. The term &quot;science&quot; is being used to encompass so much bullshit that it&#39;s astounding. Meanwhile, the &quot;scientists&quot; seem to have either forgot or just don&#39;t give a fuck about the scientific method. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What field of study are you in and what do you do?</p>

<p>I am a post-doc research associate in the UK I generate models of neural circuits on chips for the development of models of neurological disorders in the Regenerative Medicine Field. I have a BSc in Biochemistry &amp; Neuroscience, MSc in Cell &amp; Tissue Engineering, and a PhD from the EPSRC. </p>

<p>The scientific method</p>

<p>And clearly you have no idea what you&#39;re talking about here. What is a hypothesis and how do you &#39;check your results against predictions&#39;? You have heard of a null-hypothesis I take it? How do you know when to reject a null hypothesis without statistical analysis? This is science, not philosophy mate. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Examples of this... There is no equivalent to any of these for Climate Change</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually there is. The greenhouse properties of certain gases can be measured using spectroscopic equipment as per this <a href="http://www.weatherquestions.com/A_backyard_greenhouse_effect_experiment.htm">relatively simple demonstration</a>. The issue is that you are trying to compare experiments that demonstrate fundamental properties of the universe with the analysis of system-wide phenomena. As I&#39;ve said multiple times in this thread, the global climate is a <em>ridiculously</em> complex system, one which we still have a fairly basic understanding of. I don&#39;t see why you would reasonably expect a simple demonstration that can somehow summarize the multitude of variables involved in real-world climatology before actually accepting some of the hypotheses. In reality most of our models for most sciences depend upon vastly simplified descriptions of phenomena that we <em>know</em> don&#39;t necessarily behave in this way in real life. That doesn&#39;t mean we reject them wholesale but rather we take these shortcomings into account when assessing what the models show us (or try to). As a biologist this is something that affects me a great deal as the complex, dynamic nature of cells seems to defy any and all attempts at accurate modelling. It doesn&#39;t mean these models have no value, just that we shouldn&#39;t take them at face value but rather interpret them with the understanding that they do not represent the whole picture. Leading to...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Quote from the Lancet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes this is, again, especially true of Biology. As The Lancet is a medical (not &#39;Science&#39;) journal they are talking here about the inherent variability of biological experiments. This is <strong>precisely why</strong> statistical analysis is so god-damn important. Consider that any and all biological organisms are the result of 3+ billion years of evolution. They are adapted to respond to cues from <em>every</em> aspect of the environment, no matter how minute. In fact often it is these minute changes which drive the heterogeneity of a culture. One example I have worked with fairly frequently is the issue of nutrient and waste distribution in static <em>in vitro</em> culture. Cells generally speaking exist in a dynamic environment, some kind of force generally exists to ensure a constant flux and flow around the cell&#39;s environment. When we then try and study cells in a culture flask we face a <em>giant</em> problem from the absence of this distribution - Suddenly individual cells may find themselves in a micro-environment entirely different from that of their neighbours and will respond accordingly. How exaclty do you suggest we control this in our experiments? Another great example that blew my mind a little during my PhD was that of pH. Did you know most labs don&#39;t properly control the pH used in their dH2O? In fact this is nearly impossible due to the amphoteric nature of water and solubility of atmospheric gases. We actually found in our labs that water from the generator dropped from pH7.1 to 6.9 around lunch time (using statistical analysis to compare multiple datapoints from 4 weeks of analysis using 1-hour timepoints...) before increasing again. Why? Not a clue but this is a <em>huge</em> difference for a cell and could well mean that media made-up around lunchtime would have a wildly different effect on the culture than media made at any other time. </p>

<p>Leading back to... </p>

<blockquote>
<p>so much of the &quot;science&quot; nowadays is actually just bullshit statistical analysis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Without this analysis it is <em>impossible</em> to seperate true results from noise. I have literally no idea how anyone who professes to understand how science works can say this. How the hell else do you determine if a result is significant? Your description of &#39;laying two graphs over one another&#39; is a laughable excuse of understanding, I&#39;d suggest watching some lectures and reading some books, maybe try doing your own work to see why this is so important. Statistics really is a beautiful tool once you begin to understand how it works. That said I do accept that there are many, <em>many</em> instances of scientists using the &#39;wrong&#39; statistics and trying to extrapolate something from a non-significant result. The reasons for this are numerous but simply put i) It <em>sucks</em> to find a non-significant result. A properly conducted experiment, especially in my field, can be the result of <em>hundreds</em> of hours of meticulous work. Quite often there is significant pressure to publish <em>something</em> with that data and even more to avoid publishing negative results. This is a sad turn of events but is not the fault of the scientific method so much as financial and professional pressures as this work is <em>expensive</em> and generating publications is pretty much the main metric of how &#39;successful&#39; someone is in academic science ii) Statistics is a ridiculously complicated field. Most scientists have not been taught statistics (though this is changing) but simply put, you&#39;re asking someone who may have minimal education in mathematics to understand an entirely separate field from what they have trained in as a student. People spend <em>years</em> training to be statisticians but there are no-where near enough of them. An ideal scenario would be if scientists had the ability to hand their data over to a professional statistician but again there are issues with this in terms of needing to understand how variables interact, which variables are interesting, how the data can best be represented etc. etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The state of science in America</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not American so I can&#39;t say however from outside observation the main issues I tend to find is there there is a <em>huge</em> gap between the level of knowledge in the public field and in academia. Far too many people seem to have the kind of attitude that you have in terms of feeling like they understand science better than the people who have dedicated their lives and careers to the field. Let me tell you, if scientists wanted to get rich, we wouldn&#39;t be fuckin&#39; scientists. It is a <em>hard</em> job with few prospects and comparatively little pay for the amount of training and work required. People do not seem to have a good grasp of how scientists actually work, the amount of communication and peer-review involved at all levels etc. Genuinely <em>the greatest</em> thing you can achieve as a scientist is to disrupt the <em>status quo</em> and introduce a new paradigm. We <em>dream</em> of achieving this. It means fortune and it means fame. We are not a cabal trying to further our own agenda, we are trying to identify what the fuck is going on in the objective reality outside of our subjective senses. Mathematics, including statistics, is by far the best tool we have for achieving this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As an electrical engineer studying electric engines and clean energy, here&#39;s my input. </p>

<p>1.) doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s a conspiracy. Clean energy (especially electric engines) in their infancy are more efficient than fossil fueled combustion engines 100 years developed. Embrace the new cool tech.</p>

<p>2.) the facts above about how we put a small ass amount of CO2 in the air compared to its natural levels is totally believable. My concern with our current energy usage is pollution. I&#39;m not too concerned with melting the ice caps. Mother Earth has ways to deal with it and there&#39;s plenty of room left in Central US for new cities should the water level rise. I&#39;m more concerned with the after-products of coal and other forms of pollutants being tossed into our water and air supplies by coporationfags</p>

<p>Edit: also, I saw once that really longly-named volcano in Iceland?? (Not sure) a few years back launched so much CO2 into the air that it undid the carbon reducing efforts of a decade. If someone has a source to back this up, then the &quot;global warming from CO2&quot; shit is 100% just political nonsense</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a bioengineer, and I agree with the tech...just a few problems with it. </p>

<p>One of my main interests is hemp. I&#39;ve collaborated on studies and may be the foremost researcher on it in my region. </p>

<p>Hemp is legal in Canada...but not really. The redtape watchdog pointed to hemp three times as an area with too many bureaucratic obstacles. </p>

<p>Farmers must buy pedigree seeds (which cost ten times what they can sell their own grain for), you need a license (good for one calendar year) to grow, store, transport, process and research hemp.</p>

<p>Hemp is specified as having less than 0.3% THC (it can&#39;t get you high) but you need to test it which adds several hundred dollars to the cost of growing. Of course, there are no testers available in my region, so...</p>

<p>Farmers are liable for volunteer plants. If any hemp pops up in the following year, then you have breached your license and are fully liable.</p>

<p>One of hemps most common current uses for the byproduct (hemp shiv) is in a building material called hempcrete. Hempcrete was used to house the archives of the British Museum. It self-regulates humidity, is an excellent insulator and is highly fire resistant. There are many other good qualities: it&#39;s near soundproof, rot-resistant, doesn&#39;t off-gas and is carbon neutral.</p>

<p>In many countries it&#39;s used quite a bit: Australia, France, England.</p>

<p>So, a farmer jumps through all the hoops, gets the grain from the hemp and then has a byproduct which is a renewable building material. So it becomes attractive to environmentally conscious folks. And they apply for a building permit.</p>

<p>6 months of bureaucratic hurdles with the hemp just sitting there and they ok the project, with the caveat that hempcrete buildings will &quot;never&quot; be granted another license.</p>

<p>There are roughly 100,000 acres of hemp being grown this year. Enough byproduct to produce 100,000 2000 ft<sup>2</sup> houses. </p>

<p>It just can&#39;t be used. </p>

<p>Embracing the &quot;new cool tech&quot; is great. But don&#39;t kid yourself. They aren&#39;t in this to make solutions available. </p>

<p>This is not even particularly new. It has been used for centuries, perhaps millennia. </p>

<p>There are countless examples. Rocket stoves can heat a house with 1/4 to 1/8 the fuel and can use scraps not suitable in normal fireplaces. Even Mark Twain recognized this importance and wrote about it. He was talking about masonry heaters, which a rocket stove is. For a hundred plus years the US could have been heating homes with cheap and efficient stoves.</p>

<p>But cheap and efficient mean less GDP. Less tax. Less government. Less control.</p>

<p>In 1916, the Department of Agriculture recognized hemp as a sustainable resource. They then made growing it illegal.</p>

<p>So, it very much does matter if it&#39;s a conspiracy, because the same folks promoting the idea are the same ones able to prevent the solutions from coming around that deprive them the money and control that the &quot;problem&quot; of CO2 is allowing them to demand.</p>

<p>Problem, reaction, solution.</p>

<p>Problem: everyone is evil because CO2,</p>

<p>Reaction: we need to stop CO2,</p>

<p>Solution: gives us the power, money and authority to do it.</p>

I definitely see your point about more money and control, but there are some out there just trying to make the world better.</p>

<p>However, in the case of hemp (and marijuana as a painkiller), the government realized widespread use of these great natural products would result in the destruction of already-established industries. </p>

<p>Most people don&#39;t know why they believe what they think to be true. We may be subject to conditioning, propaganda, peer-pressure, or lies.

Once we see that thinking in a particular way gets positive results we resist change.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe that the entire pro-AGW community is involved in conspiracy. Some, like the more well-known advocates, have flesh in the game and so will go to any lengths to obfuscate and pontificate when holes appear in the theory or predictions. Others are simply dependent on AGW for their livelihoods and so will not hear opposition. Take for example the IPCC. We all laugh when prominent believers are tripped up and aren&#39;t aware of basic details.

<p>While there may be a large-scale conspiracy we can&#39;t assume that to be so. We do see a number of smaller, inter-related conspiracies though, and most of those have to do with money. AGW is called, and considered, settled. Being outside of a settled theory carries professional and personal cost. Many researchers, journals, and others connected tangentially to AGW let their real self-interest guide their thinking.  </p>

<p>AGW is a cause for environmental concern and is therefor a political &quot;mommy&quot; issue. Mommy issue have huge traction in the public mind. Is it any wonder that AGW skeptics are so vilified? Taking a stance against AGW evokes the same visceral response as being against motherhood itself. People don&#39;t know why they&#39;re upset but they&#39;re willing to strike down all opposition if that makes them feel better. AGW is not so much a huge conspiracy as it is a cultural phenomenon that has the same effect.   </p>

<p>Okay. And? What’s your point? They exist. They are, in general, followed. One instance of not being followed does not change the definition of them being followed, nor the fact that they exist, nor is it a proof that there should be more regulations or that the institutions themselves should be shut down. The company in question was punished for them not being followed. The companies are not calling for them to be removed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’d be happy to rewrite it, then.</p>

<p>For what do the energy companies lobby? The continuation of their services. They don’t want their production to be shut down. We know, from both history and through continued operation that they’re not averse to increases in safety (physical and environmental), where necessary. Indeed, increasing profits naturally comes from increasing safety.</p>

<p>Humans are environmentalists at heart. This is something that the AGW crowd has <em>completely forgotten</em>. Environmentalism has nothing to do with believing in AGW, but they have co-opted the term and scream, “IF YOU DON’T BELIEVE THAT WE’RE ALREADY DOOMED TO BURN TO DEATH AND THERE’S NOTHING WE CAN DO TO STOP IT, THEN YOU ALSO BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD DUMP GARBAGE AND TOXIC WASTE EVERYWHERE AND CUT DOWN THE FORESTS.” This is utter nonsense.</p>

<p>No energy company wants to remove their scrubbers or be allowed to destroy the environment. A company cares for its profits, and as no customers would accept such behavior, it would lose all of its profits in engaging therein.</p>

<p>Current energy company lobbying pertains to not putting every single last one of their employees out of their jobs, which is what the AGW crowd demands. Look at Alberta. Canada’s near-marxist government has destroyed the economy. Plants are shut down, no one can work, and suicides are skyrocketing. The government wants complete and utter control over what people can and cannot consume, never mind what they can and cannot do. If it gets bad enough, I hope the “Texas of Canada” gives sincere consideration to leaving Canada and joining the Union, as we’d love to have them, their resources, and wouldn’t deny them their livelihood.</p>

<p>I’ll mention that lobbying should be a felony, but stopping it would be unenforceable. We’re in a bad position.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sir,
I understand that you seem to have a personal connection to the oil industry--and perhaps you or a relative gained employment from it. </p>

<p>I agree with you that what would happen to the entire oil-based industry is tragic for the people who make their lives from it.</p>

<p>Yet, when we are concerned with the health of the public--the health of your grandchildren--we cannot choose today to preserve these jobs if they pose a danger. I&#39;m sure, if it were some other industry affected, you&#39;d say: &quot;Well, those people need to find new jobs.&quot; Harder to say that when it&#39;s your kid.</p>

<p>You and people who share your opinions are really hanging 100% of your point on the hope that, despite the last 20 years of ongoing concern about this exact issue, despite the thousands and thousands of scientists who have been working in competitive fields, writing papers, researching, finding evidence, shooting down the viewpoints of other scientists--despite all that work--scientists have only grown more convinced human-caused climate change is a serious danger, one that could potentially cause runaway global climate change that actually exterminates all human life on this planet by as soon as 2030. Sounds crazy, right? </p>

<p>So, I know what you&#39;re hoping for. Some big giant bombshell that all the world&#39;s scientists have been lying. It was just a big farce. THAT&#39;s what you&#39;re hoping for. But let me ask you this. How often in life do you PLAN and BASE your future life on &quot;what you hoped was true&quot;. Basically, by assuming that this AGW thing is going to be proven as just a hoax, you are risking everything--the lives of your grandchildren. You really that sure? Sure that EVERYBODY is lying?</p>

<p>Since you wrote back in a calm manner, I will make one request from you. Now, I&#39;m betting that you&#39;ve heard of a guy--former Republican Governor of California? Arnold Schwartzenegger? </p>

<p>There is a documentary with Arnold that I will ask you to watch. </p>

<p>You can always come back and ridicule it here. But just watch. What can it harm you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, you provided links to known climate-denier sites. </p>

<p>When asked for any climate research done by either Singer or Seitz, you sent me a link that allegedly contained 1350 links--but that list was actually examined and shown to contain nothing of the sort.</p>

<p>So, as long as we accept all the climate denier bullshit from your side that is funded by the people whose bottom line would be affected by this change, I think it&#39;s clear that your sources cannot be believed.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s look at just one of the links I&#39;ve been hammering: <a href="http://ameg.me/">Arctic Methane Emergency Group</a>. Let&#39;s look at the name of that group of respected scientists that started that <strong>Arctic Methane Emergency Group</strong>. Notice, they didn&#39;t decided to officially call their group the &quot;Arctic Methane <em>Inconvenience</em> Group&quot;. Nor did they call it the &quot;Arctic Methane <em>Study</em> Group&quot;. No, this group of respected scientists put their hard-won professional reputations on the line to form a group called the Arctic Methane <strong>Emergency</strong> Group. </p>

<p>So, to believe your side&#39;s money-tainted opinion--the whole thing is a big nothing myth. </p>

<p>Well, I gather that you just barked out the word &quot;Yes!&quot; but <em>unfortunately for you</em>, most Americans are really convinced that AGW exists and is human caused, by our use of fossil fuels. Most Americans are just about to hate and despise the entire oil industry--even more than they did when it was pushing that ridiculous, Ogalalla-aquifer-endangering Keystone XL that President Obama slapped away, or when BP was spewing millions and millions of barrels of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico, leaving oil dispersed on the bottom of that body of ocean in a way that it will burp up for thousands of years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If everything is hunky dory in the Arctic, why do you think they named it the &quot;Arctic Methane <strong>Emergency</strong> Group&quot;? You think it&#39;s just a big joke?</p>

<p>If we&#39;re talking the financial interests behind the two polar opposites--let&#39;s consider who is better funded--Kochs, ExxonMobile, Chevron on the carbon side and on the green side who are the big pockets? Soros? Who stands to make a lot of money if climate change is a real problem that we have to deal with?</p>

<p>So, you are hanging your entire side&#39;s truth on the hard fact--you allege--that the ENTIRE AGW thing is a hoax designed to allow PhD candidates to get grants? Or maybe Elon Musk with Solar City? Who else? </p>

<p>I will grant you that the deniers side has done its work well. It has done the easy job of convincing Americans to be cynical. The Gallup poll you linked to is worth counting only if you don&#39;t step back and consider that you have Rupert Murdock&#39;s Fox News ready and eager to feed misinformation to all the &quot;low effort thinkers&quot; who watch Fox and take it all as gospel. <strong>You</strong> know that Fox is full of shit--but they&#39;re all your side has. Your polls only merely confirm that the deniers have been successful in triggering the cynicism of Americans. But you know what is the most cynical person of all? A person who has been willfully misled--such as Exxon just recently admitted to having done, by funding all those denier groups that hoodwinked <em>you</em>. Eventually, the American public--and the world--will understand the deception that was orchestrated among the deniers. It&#39;s repellent and you will, one day, feel that you were led down the garden path by the denier community.</p>

<p>Of course I am not okay with a train carrying oil derailing. No, I hate that equally with your pipeline-fed tar sands. I want your Canadian tar sands to stay in the ground where it belongs. It costs 40% of the energy you extract just to mine and process it. Tar Sands oil is bad and should not be used. </p>

<p>Millions die from pollution in China alone. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>climate change was pushed after pollution was deemed too nebulous to act on.   The stakes were seen to fit the agenda for alarmism.</p>

<p>The effort to control the agenda started with money but now the pro-sovereignty crowds have been stimulated into siding with the climate change deniers.    Very interesting and slightly amusing.   Also cringe-worthy.</p>

<p>Its akin to the environmental movement turning pro-nuclear power.   Even to the point of embracing the efforts to claim that the damaging effects of Chernobyl and Fukushima were being blown out of proportion and supporting the reactivation of nuclear plants in Japan,   and condemning the closure of nuclear plants in Germany.</p>

<p>Information and misinformation are truly the new battlegrounds.</p>

<p>My takeaway is that each issue has to be investigated without reliance on the franchise of the media channel we heard it from.    The story being broken is the hero,    not the messenger.    Too many messengers have let a little bit of notoriety go to their heads,   and are distracted by their attempts to profit by the status that their message could afford them.</p>

<p>In other words,  we need to ask questions faster than the media channels can decide for us what the real issues are.    Right now,   the climate change deniers are fixated on the problems of correlating climate change with human industrial activity.    Millions dying from pollution are not of concern to them,  evidently.</p>

<p>We can all be distracted by a Judy Wood from time to time.    That doesn&#39;t mean that Richard Gage is perfect either.    But the real stories stand the test of time.    And the lies do end up getting exposed.    </p>

<p>In the long run,   those who do not come clean on their mistakes are shown to be self-promoters more than they were committed to the truth.</p>

<p>In the long run,   the statistical correlations of human activity with climate interference will prevail.    What other natural event on the planet was the equivalent of man&#39;s consumption of fossil fuels over the last 100 years?   Merely by volume of impact of the mined and burned (vaporized into the atmosphere) of coal,  natural gas,  and crude oil?    How much is just 80 million barrels of oil a day?   That would be 19,000 normal sized supertanker loads a year for global demand.    Every year.    If you can&#39;t imagine this  having an effect on the greenhouse effect,   I would call that make believe.   <a href="http://gadgetopia.com/post/6118">http://gadgetopia.com/post/6118</a>  And remember,  that does not include mountains of coal every year,   or the deforestation of Indonesia or the Amazon.</p>

<p>It reminds me of the dismissal of the Gulf oil spill a few years back,   the dismissal of the toxic effects of the dispersants (corexit) that were sprayed in the Gulf.     The deal is that the media can suppress the news of the impacts to life,   and that other news events eventually drown out the chatter.    </p>

<p>Only this time,   we are rolling much bigger dice.</p>

<p>Just last November 23, 2015, the Proceedings of the National Academies of Science (PNAS) published an extensive report that confirms in detail that ExxonMobile and the Koch Brothers funded allegedly independent groups dedicated to spreading climate denial disinformation. Here is the report: </p>

<p><a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/11/18/1509433112.abstract">Corporate funding and ideological polarization about climate change</a></p>

<p>Quoting: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;<strong>Significance</strong></p>

<p><em>Ideological polarization around environmental issues—especially
climate change—have increased in the last 20 years. 
This polarization has led to public uncertainty, and in some cases,
policy stalemate. Much attention has been given to understanding
individual attitudes, but much less to the larger organizational 
and financial roots of polarization. This gap is due to prior
difficulties in gathering and analyzing quantitative data about 
these complex and furtive processes. This paper uses
comprehensive text and network data to show how corporate
funding influences the production and actual thematic content
of polarization efforts. It highlights the important influence of
private funding in public knowledge and politics, and provides
researchers a methodological model for future studies that blend
large-scale textual discourse with social networks</em>.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<strong>Abstract</strong>
<em>Drawing on large-scale computational data and methods, 
this research demonstrates how polarization efforts are influenced
by a patterned network of political and financial actors. 
These dynamics, which have been notoriously difficult to quantify,
are illustrated here with a computational analysis of climate change
politics in the United States. The comprehensive data include all
individual and organizational actors in the climate change
countermovement (164 organizations), as well as all written and
verbal texts produced by this network between 1993–2013 
(40,785 texts, more than 39 million words). Two main findings
emerge. First, that organizations with corporate funding were 
more likely to have written and disseminated texts meant to
polarize the climate change issue. Second, and more importantly,
that corporate funding influences the actual thematic content of
these polarization efforts, and the discursive prevalence of that
thematic content over time. These findings provide new, and
comprehensive, confirmation of dynamics long thought to be at the
root of climate change politics and discourse. Beyond the specifics
of climate change, this paper has important implications for
understanding ideological polarization more generally, and the
increasing role of private funding in determining why certain
polarizing themes are created and amplified. Lastly, the paper
suggests that future studies build on the novel approach taken 
here that integrates large-scale textual analysis with social
networks</em>.&quot;</p>

<p>No one except you is confused about which side Exxon is on. </p>

<p>Thank you for doing your part to motivate my side. With every outrageous comment people like you make on your side, you further outrage people on my side, and further motivate us to mobilize and come after liars like ExxonMobile and the Koch Brothers. They can pull off their flimflam denial for only so long. </p>

<p>I have no doubt that you personally--eventually--will throw all this aside and say out loud: &quot;I was wrong. This is real and we need to do everything we can to stop it.&quot; But by then, given the way CO2 has a ten year head start on us, it will be too late. </p>

<p>I reviewed all 53 of the papers referenced by Exxon’s spokesman, and they indeed consist of high-quality scientific research. Most of them implicitly or explicitly endorsed the expert consensus on human-caused global warming; none minimized or rejected it. This means that there is a 100% consensus on human-caused global warming among Exxon’s peer-reviewed climate science research – even higher than the 97% consensus in the rest of the peer-reviewed literature.</p>

<p>What a coincidence? Oh, but even better, they are the same guys who are the &quot;big bad wolf&quot;. Amazing. They are simultaneously the supporters and opposers.

Not that they need the help as their own predictions discredit themselves. How many times can they be 100% incorrect and you still believe what they say? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, most sincere climate scientist do not claim that human life will be exterminated.  That&#39;s a totally unsubstantiated view.  The concern is more over severe disruptions that could cause famine and maybe some coastal flooding.  Which, admittedly, is theoretically capable of displacing hundreds of millions of people.</p>

<p>But, no, the other climate records do not agree with the &quot;hottest month on record&quot;.  The satellite data shows cooling, and historic ice cores show hotter global temperatures in the recent past etc etc</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a conspiracy.  It&#39;s politics and hierarchy.  What&#39;s your take on Judith Curry?  A shill?  Anyone who comes out against alarmism is called a shill and a sell-out and loses their job.  It&#39;s not a conspiracy, because it&#39;s not being done in secret.  It&#39;s just massive group think.</p>

<p>What I described about scientific studies was saying that people trust the CRU or GISS data because their professional environment tells them to. And if they raise questions, they get ostracized.  In fact one of the biggest smoking guns of climategate was how prevalent this sort of protectionism was where they strategize do how to discredit intellectual foes, and get only peer reviewers on their side.  </p>

<p>Look academia is screwed up.  It&#39;s economics sucks and is wrecking the world.  It&#39;s history and politics favor terrible killer tyrant leaders.  It&#39;s crap.  There&#39;s very little accountability in the academic system, because it&#39;s so hierarchical and compartmentalized.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When only CO2 is considered, most climate scientists push the harshest effects of warming out to 2050-2100. The IPCC really does not consider Methane. Recall, the Arctic sea floor and all that Siberian permafrost holds gigatons of Methane hydrates. Once the CO2 warming has happened sufficiently to melt the Arctic sea ice cover, the Methane hydrates start to melt quickly. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not a question of sincerity--it&#39;s science. I invite you to start googling for scientific journals that consider the warming triggered by those big belches of Methane-hydrate gas that have already started bubbling up, including a 150km-wide hole in the Arctic ice that was suggested to be Methane bubbles.</p>

<p>I agree that each individual academic would be biased to accept the data coming from their particular set of sensors. But that does <strong>not</strong> explain why the same warming is being replicated from <em>every single other method</em> of measurement. </p>

<p>The curiously named Arctic Methane Emergency Group&#39;s website: <a href="http://ameg.me/">http://ameg.me/</a></p>

<p>On the subject of the methane warming, I will simply ask you to spend an hour viewing these and then telling me where I&#39;ve misread them. The number of <strong>2030 for total human extinction</strong> comes not from me but from this research. Once you consider Methane, 2030 looks all the more plausible.</p>

<p>I agree that there are perverse microcosms in academia, where anything is possible. But that does not explain the vast numbers of datasets that are all agreeing on the warming and its cause. For this to actually be a hoax or academics looking to start gravy trains--it would have to include 100% of the world&#39;s academics. </p>

<p>As for <a href="https://www.skepticalscience.com/curry-ohc-corrections.html">Judith Curry</a>, she predicates her views on the existence of the alleged warming &quot;pause&quot; which has been shown to be fictional. Scientific American, a trusted source of information for over two-hundred years, stated that the &quot;pause&quot; did not happen: <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/no-pause-in-global-warming/">No Pause in Global Warming: A new study suggests that global warming continues to steadily increase</a>. So, without the fictional &quot;pause&quot;, Judith Curry&#39;s claims cease to exist. What you are seeing in the case of Judith Curry is the academic system weeding out a scientist more interested in a pushing a political agenda than in doing objective research and science.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The pause did happen, and it took ten years of hit and miss theories and manipulating surface temperature data to rationalize the facts of the pause away.  Have you read the critique of that blatantly shallow study?  Judith Curry doesn&#39;t seem to have many incentives to be political.  Her claim to want to just pursue the evidence rigorously seems valid, since alarmists tend to immediately accept any half-baked study or explanation to support their viewpoint.  So, your attitude seems to confirm that it&#39;s the academic community that&#39;s broken, not Judith Curry.</p>

<p>As for methane, I have trouble believing that.  Hasn&#39;t the ice melted before?  That implies we used to have all that has in the atmosphere. Life was around back then wasn&#39;t it?  </p>

<p>And if 2030 is when we&#39;ll die, what could we possibly do to stop it today?  How can we possibly stop that train short of self-suicide ahead of time, if that would even stop it.</p>

<p>I think you&#39;re buying into the hype.  Consider this: global warming a not a big deal.  We&#39;re in an interglacial period of an ice age.  It will continue to get warmer for a few centuries and then we&#39;ll transition back into a terrible ice age.  At least, human release of carbon back into the atmosphere favors plant growth since the ice age has left atmospheric carbon levels dangerously low.  Therefore, we should relax, and focus on long term social and technological changes.  Tech that will come to fruition in two or three centuries, to socks our long term energy needs.  Fossil fuels will last at least that long, though the cost will go up as more advanced extraction technology is needed to get harder to access but still fairly uniquitous oil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, by saying the alleged Pause did happen, are you saying that <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/no-pause-in-global-warming/">Scientific American&#39;s article: &quot;No Pause in Global Warming: A new study suggests that global warming continues to steadily increase&quot;</a> is dishonest or incompetent? Which is it?</p>

<p>No, the methane did not come from the atmosphere. In the case of permafrost, the vast quantities that come from its melting come from millennia of frozen plant material that finally all rots once its melted. So, you have demonstrated you don&#39;t understand the science behind Methane. </p>

<p>You offer a theory &quot;interglacial period&quot;. If we on the AGW side were to propose such a theory, your side would instantly clamor for proof or some theory that fits and explains the data. Do you have any such data or foundation for this theory of yours? </p>

<p>I think you are being fooled if you think this climate change is not a problem. Allowing CO2 to reach its current 400+ppm creates conditions that humans have never before seen. It unleashes dozens of positive feedback loops that make it so runaway climate change happens quickly and then it will take 10 million years for conditions to again become conducive to life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I had trouble replying because it turns out that the study was in Science, and Scientific American just wrote about it.  It&#39;s late here.</p>

<p>Yeah, this study is dishonest and incompetent.  The pause is real and alarmist have spent 10 years trying to explain it.  They assume warming must be real, and when it doesn&#39;t happen they assume there must be &#39;missing heat&#39; somewhere.  Each explanation doesn&#39;t pan out, so they come up with new ones.  This one attempt, from June cheats by adjusting historical data in the arctic <em>for which no data exists</em>.  Basically, they&#39;re saying &quot;we can&#39;t find the warming, so it must be in a place we don&#39;t measure, because we <em>know</em> there&#39;s warming even though the data doesn&#39;t support it&quot;.  Again, lefties and climate alarmists have a habit of talking about how empirical and fact based they are, but they trump up one or two data points as incontrovertible final proof of their beliefs.</p>

<p><a href="http://wattsupwiththat.com/2015/06/04/noaas-new-paper-is-there-no-global-warming-hiatus-after-all/">http://wattsupwiththat.com/2015/06/04/noaas-new-paper-is-there-no-global-warming-hiatus-after-all/</a></p>

<p>For a brief overview.  Basically, what&#39;s going on in climate science is that warming is treated as an a priori reality.  And so when warming doesn&#39;t exist it&#39;s treated as an excuse to &quot;improve science&quot; by looking for the warming wherever it <em>might possibly</em> exist.</p>

<p>Even neutral sources say that the Science study suggests more data is needed.</p>

<p>Methane is the new bogeyman because the CO2 case has collapsed so strongly, in the science at least.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That list of lies is not very substantive.  It&#39;s just a list of things he said with &quot;I know you are but what am I&quot; narrative signaling retorts.  I hate to say it, but you realize this is trumped up.  They made substantive critiques of the Science report.  This is ignored.  Instead, half-baked allegations and character assassinations.  Judith Curry went through the same thing.  I&#39;m sorry, but again it seems
The curse of academia is present in your perspective.  There&#39;s a desperate effort to promote narrative conformity, and argue truth from the measuring stick of what conforms or not to the narrative.  But the substance is ignored.</p>

<p>There has been a very noticeable pause in temperature rise.  This has been acknowledged.  They said the oceans ate the heat energy.  That was discredited. This was acknowledged.  They said surface temperature showed warming.  This was discredited by a careful audit of the way station data was manipulated and adjusted.  This was, while not acknowledged, tacitly conceded, because now they are finding warming in the arctic, a region notoriously impossible to get reliable data from (since the surface is generally ice, it remains consistently cool despite global variability, meaning you can &#39;adjust&#39; the data however you choose).  Sorry, this isn&#39;t credible science.  And &quot;oil shills&quot; like Watts have provoked alarmist scientists to <em>admit</em> their half-baked rationalizations about the pause are a joke.  Which is exactly why they keep looking in more and more obscure places for the warming.  The goal is to generate a headline: &quot;pause is disproven, there&#39;s no pause&quot;.  Which is meant to settle the matter in the public mind, when in fact climate scientists are still studying &quot;why&quot; there&#39;s a pause, which there obviously is.</p>

<p>I read an article about sinking atolls in the pacific.  It said coral growth, shifting sand and &quot;rising sea levels from climate change&quot; are why the atolls are sinking.  While climate alarmism predicts eventual sea level rise in the near future, there hasn&#39;t been any observed sea level rise other than what has been the trend for many hundreds of years, in other words, not yet.  But media can get away with blaming sinking islands in the present on climate change.  Because that&#39;s the environment, the anti-intellectual anti-science anti-evidence environment the alarmists have created.  The island sinks because of climate change, because the government said so.  Why does the government think this - why, it&#39;s the party line: global warming <em>is</em> causing extraordinary sea level rise <em>today</em>.  Not because of facts, but because that is the government line which harmonizes with the hypotheses, not evidence, of lousy climate scientists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, other than your blanket, ideological objection to regulation in principle--do you have some insights on why you do not accept the SCIENCE?</p>

<p>Also, I gather that you do not trust President Obama. That is your right. </p>

<p>But that DOES NOT explain how and why every other country on earth also accepts the SCIENCE behind human-caused global warming--how do you explain that? Also, this problem had been recognized years before President Obama was elected. </p>

<p>No one is saying that CO2 is a poison. </p>

<p>So, are you just a loud idiot who is afraid of the science? You will die just the same in your ignorance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fine. I will assess your article point by point, <em>while knowing that you will fail to do me the same courtesy and not review any of the information I have linked to previously</em>.</p>

<p>Your article attempts to make 10 points, which I will address in sequence:</p>

<p>Assertion #1: &quot;Temperature records from around the world do not support the assumption that today’s temperatures are unusual.&quot; [<em>No sources provided whatsoever so impossible to pursue those sources</em>.]</p>

<p>Evidence against assertion #1:
Source: <a href="http://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/">NASA Climate Evidence</a></p>

<p>Quoting: &quot;<em>All three major global surface temperature reconstructions show that Earth has warmed since 1880.[<a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/indicators/">5</a>] Most of this warming has occurred since the 1970s, with the 20 warmest years having occurred since 1981 and with all 10 of the warmest years occurring in the past 12 years. [6] Even though the 2000s witnessed a solar output decline resulting in an unusually deep solar minimum in 2007-2009, surface temperatures continue to increase. [7]</em>&quot;</p>

<p>[6]: T.C. Peterson et.al., &quot;State of the Climate in 2008,&quot; Special Supplement to the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, v. 90, no. 8, August 2009, pp. S17-S18.</p>

<p>[7]: I. Allison et.al., The Copenhagen Diagnosis: Updating the World on the Latest Climate Science, UNSW Climate Change Research Center, Sydney, Australia, 2009, p. 11.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>Assertion #2: &quot;Satellite temperature data does not support the assumption that temperatures are rising rapidly&quot;</p>

<p>Evidence against assertion #2:</p>

<p>Source #1: <a href="https://www.skepticalscience.com/satellite-measurements-warming-troposphere.htm">Satellite measurements of warming in the troposphere</a></p>

<p>Quoting: &quot;<em>Previously reported discrepancies between the amount of warming near the surface and higher in the atmosphere have been used to challenge the reliability of climate models and the reality of human-induced global warming... This significant discrepancy no longer exists because errors in the satellite and radiosonde data have been identified and corrected. New data sets have also been developed that do not show such discrepancies.</em>&quot;</p>

<p>Source #2: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/03/24/ted-cruz-says-satellite-data-show-the-globe-isnt-warming-this-satellite-scientist-feels-otherwise/">Ted Cruz says satellite data show the globe isn’t warming. <strong>This satellite scientist feels otherwise</strong></a> [Emphasis Added]</p>

<p>Quoting from the <strong>original researcher whose work Cruz cited</strong> on evidence of the alleged satellite discrepancy: 
&quot;<em>Mr. Cruz (and others who seek to minimize the threat posed by climate change) likes to cite statistics about the last 17 years because 17 years ago [1998], the Earth was experiencing a large ENSO [El Nino-Southern Oscillation] event and the observed temperatures were substantially above normal, and above any long-term trend line a reasonable person would draw. When one starts their analysis on an extraordinarily warm year, the resulting trend is below the true long term trend. It’s like a pro baseball player deciding he’s having a batting slump three weeks after a game when he hit three homers because he’s only considering those three weeks instead of the whole season.</em>&quot; [Emphasis added]</p>

<p>Source #3: <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/mar/20/ted-cruz/ted-cruzs-worlds-fire-not-last-17-years/">PolitiFact rates this as a MostlyFalse</a></p>

<p>.</p>

<p>Assertion #3: &quot;Current temperatures are always compared to the temperatures of the 1980’s, but for many parts of the world the 1980’s was the coldest decade of the last 100+ years&quot;</p>

<p>Evidence against Assertion #3: In this case, the author&#39;s <em>previous point</em> picks an arbitrary starting point of 17 years ago--which was 1998, the last biggest El Nino year--and that is by definition cherry picking. Had the author picked 20 years ago, his entire point would be gone. So, after the severely damning response to assertion #2, I don&#39;t think this is worth any more proof.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>Assertion #4: &quot;The world experienced a significant cooling trend between 1940 and 1980&quot;</p>

<p>Evidence against Assertion #4: <a href="https://www.skepticalscience.com/global-cooling-mid-20th-century.htm">Why did climate cool in the mid-20th Century?</a>
This is an area of intense research. Two points have been made that may have relevance. Starting in 1940, industrial output surged--first for the war and then for the rapid industrialization. Because of lax pollution controls at the time, significant aerosol particulates were released into the air, thereby decreasing solar radiation that reached the planet surface. Ironically, once the 1970s pollution-control measures went into effect the aerosols decreased and so did the cooling effect of those aerosols. Also, starting in 1945, the method used to calculate ocean temperature changed significantly. Finally, following the observation that nighttime temperatures would not be affected by aerosols, when they looked at that, the discrepancy went away. </p>

<p>. </p>

<p>Assertion #5: &quot;Urban heat island effect skews the temperature data of a significant number of weather stations&quot;</p>

<p>Evidence against assertion #5: <a href="http://www.skepticalscience.com/surface-temperature-measurements.htm">Are surface temperature records reliable?</a>
&quot;<em>Independent studies using different software, different methods, and different data sets yield very similar results. The increase in temperatures since 1975 is a consistent feature of all reconstructions. This increase cannot be explained as an artifact of the adjustment process, the decrease in station numbers, or other non-climatological factors.  Natural temperature measurements also confirm the general accuracy of the instrumental temperature record.</em>&quot;</p>

<p>This article is chock full of original science and explanations of all the details of how these measurements were made, how these results have withstood analysis by many independent groups and how these results have been replicated all over the place.</p>

<p>&quot;<em>Conclusions: The well-known and widely-cited reconstructions of global temperature, produced by NASA GISS, UEA CRU, and NOAA NCDC, are replicable. Independent studies using different software, different methods, and different data sets yield very similar results. The increase in temperatures since 1975 is a consistent feature of all reconstructions, and is also a feature found in reconstructions from natural temperature proxy measurements.  This increase cannot be explained as an artifact of the adjustment process, the decrease in station numbers, or other non-climatological factors.</em>&quot;</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>Assertion #6: &quot;There is a natural inverse relationship between global temperatures and atmospheric CO2 levels&quot;</p>

<p>Evidence against assertion #6: 
Source: <a href="https://www.skepticalscience.com/co2-temperature-correlation.htm">Does CO2 always correlate with temperature (and if not, why not?)</a></p>

<p>Quoting: &quot;<em>The Earth’s climate is a complex system, acting in ways we can’t always predict. The energy that man-made CO2 is adding to the climate is not currently showing up as surface warming, because most of the heat is going into the oceans. Currently, the heat is moving downwards from the ocean surface to deeper waters. The surface gets cooler, humidity reduces (water vapour is a powerful greenhouse gas), and air temperatures go down</em>.
&quot;<em>The rate at which surface temperatures go up is not proportional to the rate of CO2 emissions, but to the total amount of atmospheric CO2 added since the start of the industrial revolution. Only by looking at long-term trends - 30 years is the standard period in climate science - can we measure surface temperature increases accurately, and distinguish them from short-term natural variation.</em>&quot;</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>Assertion #7: &quot;The CO2 cannot, from a scientific perspective, be the cause of significant global temperature changes&quot;</p>

<p>Evidence against assertion #7: 
Source: <a href="https://www.skepticalscience.com/empirical-evidence-for-co2-enhanced-greenhouse-effect.htm">How do we know more CO2 is causing warming?</a></p>

<p>Quoting: &quot;<em>As temperatures started to rise, scientists became more and more interested in the cause. Many theories were proposed. All save one have fallen by the wayside, discarded for lack of evidence. One theory alone has stood the test of time, strengthened by experiments.  We know CO2 absorbs and re-emits longwave radiation (Tyndall). The theory of greenhouse gases predicts that if we increase the proportion of greenhouse gases, more warming will occur (Arrhenius). Scientists have measured the influence of CO2 on both incoming solar energy and outgoing long-wave radiation. Less longwave radiation is escaping to space at the specific wavelengths of greenhouse gases. Increased longwave radiation is measured at the surface of the Earth at the same wavelengths.</em>&quot;</p>

<p>So, each of your points is a well-known and discredited attack on the solid--and nuanced--actual science. </p>

<p>I understand that the average &quot;low effort thinker&quot; who thinks AGW is a hoax will never understand the science. The great tragedy is that Joe Sixpack/Fox News viewer and his peers with Libertarianism-induced dementia will never understand any of this until it&#39;s way too late.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for attempting to refute the ten points in the article that you claim are all dishonest. I know you think there are NO scientists that study the climate that do not 100% agree we are all going to fry and fry soon. Hopefully, you will research this point a little to see that is not the case. Once you do, you will realize that these scientists, all extremely persecuted for their beliefs as if they were flat earthers, are all liars according to your beliefs. </p>

<p>Before global cooling became global warming and before global warming became climate change, a catch all that cannot be disproven as it can be blamed for all occurrences, the arguments for were much more simple. They didn&#39;t have to be &quot;nuanced&quot;. I read your rebuttals, all of which I have read before since I read the other side&#39;s arguments, and what I see is massive confirmation bias. </p>

<p>Every time a major flaw is pointed out in the theory, the data gets adjusted, the data set gets moved forward or back in time, or some new incredibly nuanced explanation is literally pulled out of someone&#39;s ass like NOW the oceans are absorbing the heat or war causes global cooling. It is like the little boy running around sticking his finger in the holes in the dike. There is always a more nuanced and complicated explanation which if anything, seems to me to be the definition of confirmation bias.  </p>

<p>Why not take it back the basics and use just plain old common sense? It is a well known fact that the climate models include  hundreds of assertions and variables, many that represent areas of science that have yet to be fully understood. These UNKNOWN variables have resulted in the multitude of times the climate model predictions over the last three to four decades have not only missed the mark, but not even come close to observable data. </p>

<p>I totally get the desire to use &quot;clean&quot; energy so our air, water and earth remain clean for future generations. I believe technology will get us there eventually. I, like most conservatives and libertarians, care for the earth as much as leftists do. However, unlike leftists, I care more about humans than the earth. </p>

<p>The reason it seems so obvious to me global warming is a giant scam, other than the demagoguery and wealth redistribution, is because it fits so perfectly with the leftist&#39;s anti-growth agenda which has been around a long time.  Be it eugenics or population control or now climate change, they all have the same anti-growth, anti-human, elitist totalitarian agenda that guarantees the death of tens if not hundreds of millions of poor on earth. It seems obvious to me that these elitists have co-opted climate science and made it into the perfect vehicle for their anti-growth agenda. After all, now it cannot be disproven, there is always a more nuanced explanation for holes in the science, 90% of it is pure speculation, and if you dissent some politicians want you arrested. </p>

<p>I know that probably sounds crazy but it is where the evidence leads.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was only ONE study in the 1970s that predicted cooling and yet that one is trotted out as if it equates to the hundreds since then with an opposite conclusion.</p>

<p>I guess I am just not willing to accept that there is a worldwide conspiracy to hoax this. Surely, as you suggested, there are scientists who dissent from the currently accepted situation--AGW. But to say that the rest are lying to make a buck--it would have to be huge numbers--I am not willing to consider. </p>

<p>If you are looking for nuance-free data, you&#39;re going to be disappointed. For example, on the satellite measurements, it&#39;s critical to have the measurements occur at precise 24-hour intervals. That does not happen because the orbit of the satellite is decaying. So, that has to be considered as a justifiable reason to account for that when interpreting the data.</p>

<p>Bottom line: you think the scientists are lying.
I think the scientists are reporting accurate, truthful data to the best of their abilities. </p>

<p>You want us to gamble that you&#39;re right. The price of the gamble? Extermination of the human race by runaway climate change. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that cooling study is used so often because the press ran it on the cover a magazine, Newsweek maybe. I had not heard of the satellite temp data being questioned before. Every where I have seen it mentioned it is presented as the most reliable from a technical perspective. That probably says more about the ground station temp issues than anything else.</p>

<p>You summed it up rather well I think. I certainly do not think we are going anywhere any time soon and I think it is ridiculous to think we can destroy our planet with CO2 emissions in the span of a couple hundred of years. We could certainly pollute the planet but that is an entire other issue and something we have already moved past in America. </p>

<p>I just feel for the poor people in the developing world who will be prohibited from getting electricity so they must continue to breath in ash and animal dung particulates to cook to survive. Is it not the height of elitist arrogance to say to these people, &quot;because we have a theory with hundreds of unknown variables in a model that tells us we MAY have run away temperatures in a thousand years, you have to remain destitute and die young.&quot;?

    <div class="md"><p>This article is horribly written and actually proves the point it tries to contradict. Just look at all the ambiguous terms and clarifying words used, no facts. In fact, the reasons they use to try to discredit, not disprove, the warming hiatus, are contradicted by the facts in the article I first posted. You know, the one with the scientific facts you &quot;chose&quot; not to believe. Or did you even read the article? </p>

<p>The simple fact is that the data had to be manipulated to reverse an obvious cooling period and every scientist or scientific publication that attempts to discredit the raw data REFUSES to use the most reliable and consistent temperature source, the satellite data. Why is that? </p>

<p>The graph they even use proves without a shadow of a doubt that the entire CO2 causing warming theory is bullshit. It clearly shows a dramatic decrease in temperatures from 1940-1980. The Vostok ice core data also backs this up. Can you bear the obvious scientific question? How do temperatures decrease for 40 years while CO2 levels are exponentially increasing if increasing CO2 is the direct cause of increasing temperature????</p>

<p>Mull that simple question over for a few days and then reevaluate why you allow your political ideology to bar your ability to think critically. Try researching this question your self and see how the supposedly unbiased &quot;scientists&quot; twist themselves into a pretzel trying to explain away this glaring evidence that their theory is utter bullshit. </p>

<p>Moreover, have you ever heard of the logical fallacy of &quot;confirmation bias&quot;? If it’s cold, it’s climate change. If it’s warm, it’s climate change. If there are big hurricanes, it’s climate change. If there are no hurricanes, it’s climate change. If Antarctic ice is receding, it’s climate change. If Antarctic ice is growing, it’s climate change. Everything and anything confirms climate change, apparently. If that’s not confirmation bias, I don’t know what is. Under the umbrella of confirmation bias is cherry-picking (where only favorable data is emphasized), special pleading (where unfavorable data is suppressed), and the anecdotal fallacy (where someone’s personal experience—like, “Hey, it’s warmer than usual today. Global warming”—is used as evidence for a conclusion).</p>

<p>One of the most important things to remember about confirmation bias is that you don’t have to be an idiot to fall prey to it. Leo Tolstoy seemed to think that smart people were more susceptible to it, actually, because they had usually done more work to arrive at their wrong conclusions and therefore had more to lose if they changed their minds. Tolstoy said, </p>

<p>&quot;I know that most men—not only those considered clever, but even those who are very clever, and capable of understanding most difficult scientific, mathematical, or philosophic problems—can very seldom discern even the simplest and most obvious truth if it be such as to oblige them to admit the falsity of conclusions they have formed, perhaps with much difficulty—conclusions of which they are proud, which they have taught to others, and on which they have built their lives.&quot;</p>

<p>That about sums up the situation with many climate scientists and all climate change alarmists. </p>

<p>As for the Scientific American, you are not making an argument. On the contrary, you are making a logical fallacy called &quot;appealing to authority&quot;. Apparently, “scientists” agree that climate change is true. And most politicians too. The only people who won’t accept it are the ignorant selfish anti-science backwater gun-cradling yahoos from the sticks. I get it. A lot of smart people have bought into anthropogenic climate change theory. I won’t call them stupid for doing it. It’s often the smart thing to do. If you’re a Democrat or a climate scientist, you would be an idiot to publicly deny climate change. Because you’d lose your job.</p>

<p>The fact is that most people on both sides of the climate change debate have picked a side for political, not scientific, reasons. Maybe you’re a Republican, and you want to appeal to your voter base and your friends in Big Oil. Well, you need to deny climate change. If you’re a Democrat and you want to appeal to the Prius drivers and stick it to the greedy capitalists, you need to confirm climate change. The difference is that climate change deniers generally can’t appeal to authority. So they’re safe from at least that fallacy. It’s the climate change alarmists who are constantly talking about the scientific and scholarly consensus when, at least logically speaking, it doesn’t matter.</p>

<p>All in all, climate change alarmism has become a clinic in logical fallacies. Actually, you can pretty much close your eyes, open a book on logical fallacies, and put your finger down at random to find another problem with climate change logic. I’ve merely scratched the surface here. Try thinking for your self. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please see my other, detailed analysis of the article you sent. It was extremely easy to shoot down most of those points because there is an active scientific community around this issue that is tired of having people cherry pick and manipulate the data so that they can go on burning fossil fuels with abandon.</p>

<p>Having a great familiarity with Tolstoy myself, I know that he would point out that the quote can easily be turned against a group of individuals--with invariably an unmentioned conflict of interest with regards to the fossil-fuels industry--who <em>want</em> to believe that climate science is a hoax. All of your comments regarding logical fallacies can easily be applied to <em>you</em>. Funny you don&#39;t see the irony in all that.</p>

<p>Finally, sir, short of opening my own lab and having you standing there performing experiments with me--neither of us has any choice but to accept the construct of our civilization and accept that our scientists as a collective will be honest, and that any wrongs there will be found out by rigorous application of the scientific method.</p>

<p>Take the example of Scientific American. You are, in essence, saying they published lies. If that happened--if someone could <strong>prove</strong>, not just make potshots from the peanut gallery, that Scientific American had committed fraud, don&#39;t you think it would be on Fox News? It&#39;s not, because you&#39;re living in a fantasy land where every scientist on earth is keeping some hush-hush secret that everybody is in on, and that every scientist working on this on earth is quietly changing the data to create a problem out of thin air. Really? Do you really think that&#39;s possible, that NOT ONE disgruntled climate scientist researcher has come forward to stay there&#39;s this big communal lie?</p>

But I also am a student of history and have studied political wealth redistribution scams like this perpetrated on peoples many times before. Why this time is different, even when the leaders of this movement admitted many years ago that it was a wealth redistribution scam, and now have proven as much in the Paris accord, I do not understand. To further prove my point here is an anti-alarmist article from, guess who.....the Scientific American!
<a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/climate-change-will-not-be-dangerous-for-a-long-time/">http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/climate-change-will-not-be-dangerous-for-a-long-time/</a></p>

<p>Is it really that crazy of an idea that an industry can be created out of whole cloth (climate science) and the people that enter this industry have a bias to support their receiving a portion of the now tens of BILLIONS of tax payer&#39;s dollars politicians have shifted from traditional energy sources to this now &quot;favored&quot; energy source? Do you not see money as a corrupting influence on &quot;scientists&quot;? Why is it that when an oil company funds a dissenting view it is discredited but when politicians fund the favoring view that is OK? Where is the logic in that? Why is it that all government employees, including the scientists, are forced to sign massive non-disclosure agreements and when they try to whistle blow under the supposed lawful protection of whistle blower laws they are attacked and persecuted by the government like they are terrorists?</p>

<p>It really is not difficult to find scientists, and yes, even climate scientists and other scientific disciplines that study the effects of climate change, that dissent from the narrative. It is VERY EASY to find scientists that disagree with the climate alarmism you hear Obama, Clinton and Kerry spouting all the time, that the world is going to end.</p>

<p>Here is a recent report on dissenting views: <a href="http://www.pbl.nl/sites/default/files/cms/publicaties/pbl-2015-climate-science-survey-questions-and-responses_01731.pdf">http://www.pbl.nl/sites/default/files/cms/publicaties/pbl-2015-climate-science-survey-questions-and-responses_01731.pdf</a></p>

<p>Here is an article summarizing it: <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/london/2015/07/31/new-study-majority-of-climate-scientists-dont-agree-with-consensus/">http://www.breitbart.com/london/2015/07/31/new-study-majority-of-climate-scientists-dont-agree-with-consensus/</a></p>

<p>The 97% consensus that so many lay people bought hook line and sinker, including you, was discredited long ago. This is why you only hear politicians, professional liars, still spouting this lie. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.populartechnology.net/2013/05/97-study-falsely-classifies-scientists.html">http://www.populartechnology.net/2013/05/97-study-falsely-classifies-scientists.html</a> </p>

<p>Even the IPCC report states they do not know to what degree man is causing the climate to change. It could be 100% like Obama would have you believe or it could be 1%. Is that fact not substantive? </p>

<p>The IPCC report also admits there is no correlation between CO2 emissions and dramatic weather events like hurricanes, tornadoes, etc. Yet, the Democratic politicians scream exactly the opposite. Why are you OK with them lying about that major point but believe everything else they say?</p>

<p>I did not see your post refuting the article I posted but will read it.</p>

<p>Have you ever watched any of the congressional hearings where you hear both sides of the argument without commercial spin?</p>

<p>There is a lot of good information here, both supportive and non-supportive. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.justfacts.com/globalwarming.asp#f25">http://www.justfacts.com/globalwarming.asp#f25</a></p>

<p>And as for the alarmist&#39;s predictions, every scientist on earth as you say, how many times can they be wrong before you start to question their agenda? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are saying that ALL the world&#39;s Climate Scientists, thousands and thousands--not just your oddball crank physicists Singer and Seitz--would have to be actively lying, continuing to lie every day. For what you are saying to be true, NOT ONE climate scientist could break their silence. There are no examples of scientists claiming to be part of such a conspiracy. The whistle-blower prizes alone would be huge. If there were ANY SUCH conspiracy, somebody would step forward. Or, worst case scenario, we would see Climate Scientists involved in dubious suicides. Yet, none of that is happening. </p>

<p>Your allegation--that the Green Movement is doing this all for the money, your alleged &quot;HUGE economic incentives&quot;, only stands if NOBODY gives up the gag. </p>

<p>And really--not everybody is like you Conservatives. Not everybody is about greed, as you folks are. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The conspiracy theory is that many thousands of scientists from many different countries and many different institutions over the course of several decades at least have somehow created a scientific hoax (which in reality would be impossible to pull off), but luckily a brave heroic band of politicians and oil companies have seen the &quot;truth&quot;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s one of many conspiracy theories which simply cannot be true because organising something on that scale involving that many people would not be anywhere near possible. It would be impossible to organise it within one country, let alone almost the entire climate science community across the whole world.</p>

<p>The real conspiracy here is that fossil fuel companies and those with financial links to them have heavily funded various organisations and politicians promoting climate change denial over many years, because oil companies and the like don&#39;t want climate change action taken that would hurt their profits.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are so naive. Are you seriously pointing to &quot;Hurricane Patricia&quot; as your basis for thinking the whole climate change is a hoax? </p>

<p>The Climate Change calamity coming our way is not confirmed by just ONE method of temperature measurement. There are now dozens and dozens of different ways of measuring the climate, from satellite, to ground-level temp measuring stations--more every day. Every single one of these methods are pointing to the same thing: our climate is getting warm at an alarming rate. Why should you care? Because CO2 does its magic and then it releases Methane gas from the frozen Arctic sea floor, and from the vast Siberian permafrost. Methane is at least 30 times more severe as a greenhouse gas. </p>

<p>This could--serious as a heart attack--kill all of us by 2030. I know that sound crazy.</p>

<p>You strike me as someone who is hanging on for dear life to a dead opinion. You are in the process or realizing that you have been wrong on this issue.</p>

<p>Have you heard of that periodical called: &quot;Scientific American&quot;? </p>

<p>Well, they disagree with you in regards to warming.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/no-pause-in-global-warming/"><strong>No Pause in Global Warming: A new study suggests that global warming continues to steadily increase</strong></a>
<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2015/06/15/a-pause-in-global-warming-not-really/"></a>
&quot;<em>The rate of global warming during the last 15 years has been as fast as the warming seen during the last half of the 20th Century, according to new study published in Science this month by scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)</em>.</p>

<p><em>The new study used the latest global surface temperature data and other improvements in the quality of the observed record. This study refutes the notion that there has been a slowdown, hiatus, or Pause, in the rate of global warming in recent years. The Pause has been a rallying cry for those not wanting to accept climate change as real.</em>&quot;</p>

<p>By losing your cool and all the other obvious bullshit you wrote, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Thrice_Baked_Ham">Thrice_Baked_Ham</a>, such as: &quot;<em>Will you commit suicide in five years, ten years, or in exactly fifteen when you realize that humanity HASN’T died off because the world hadn’t warmed? You’re obviously mentally ill enough to do it, because you’re too fucking stupid to learn how to count and see that the temperature isn’t rising. So when will you die? When will your prophecy self-fulfill?</em>&quot;, you&#39;re showing that you <strong>realize</strong> your side is in the wrong on Climate Change, and that every day brings fresh and compelling evidence of that reality. You&#39;re through and are simply too cowardly to accept that fact.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That list of lies is not very substantive.  It&#39;s just a list of things he said with &quot;I know you are but what am I&quot; narrative signaling retorts.  I hate to say it, but you realize this is trumped up.  They made substantive critiques of the Science report.  This is ignored.  Instead, half-baked allegations and character assassinations.  Judith Curry went through the same thing.  I&#39;m sorry, but again it seems
The curse of academia is present in your perspective.  There&#39;s a desperate effort to promote narrative conformity, and argue truth from the measuring stick of what conforms or not to the narrative.  But the substance is ignored.</p>

<p>There has been a very noticeable pause in temperature rise.  This has been acknowledged.  They said the oceans ate the heat energy.  That was discredited. This was acknowledged.  They said surface temperature showed warming.  This was discredited by a careful audit of the way station data was manipulated and adjusted.  This was, while not acknowledged, tacitly conceded, because now they are finding warming in the arctic, a region notoriously impossible to get reliable data from (since the surface is generally ice, it remains consistently cool despite global variability, meaning you can &#39;adjust&#39; the data however you choose).  Sorry, this isn&#39;t credible science.  And &quot;oil shills&quot; like Watts have provoked alarmist scientists to <em>admit</em> their half-baked rationalizations about the pause are a joke.  Which is exactly why they keep looking in more and more obscure places for the warming.  The goal is to generate a headline: &quot;pause is disproven, there&#39;s no pause&quot;.  Which is meant to settle the matter in the public mind, when in fact climate scientists are still studying &quot;why&quot; there&#39;s a pause, which there obviously is.</p>

<p>I read an article about sinking atolls in the pacific.  It said coral growth, shifting sand and &quot;rising sea levels from climate change&quot; are why the atolls are sinking.  While climate alarmism predicts eventual sea level rise in the near future, there hasn&#39;t been any observed sea level rise other than what has been the trend for many hundreds of years, in other words, not yet.  But media can get away with blaming sinking islands in the present on climate change.  Because that&#39;s the environment, the anti-intellectual anti-science anti-evidence environment the alarmists have created.  The island sinks because of climate change, because the government said so.  Why does the government think this - why, it&#39;s the party line: global warming <em>is</em> causing extraordinary sea level rise <em>today</em>.  Not because of facts, but because that is the government line which harmonizes with the hypotheses, not evidence, of lousy climate scientists.</p>
