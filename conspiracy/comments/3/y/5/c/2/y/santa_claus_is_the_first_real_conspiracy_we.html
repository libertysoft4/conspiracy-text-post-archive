    <div class="md"><p>I PM&#39;d rockran and called him/her out on his/her user account only replying to /conspiracy and I accused him/her of being a shill and this was rockran&#39;s response:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t really use this account for much beyond <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> stuff, generally space-related since that&#39;s a personal interest. Other sciency stuff too, sometimes, like GMO stuff or 9/11 thermite, and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve talked about vaccines at some point?</p>

<p>As for getting paid, my NWO Illuminati masters are pretty stingy on my monthly shekels, so I get extra from the NSA&#39;s secret MKUltra-controlled Bilderbergers. It adds up! :P</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This guy/gal has multiple accounts for different agendas.  </p>

<p>Although he/she tries to bring in MKUltra and all that other bullshit into this to try and make light of the subject, I&#39;m thinking rockran is a shill of some sort.  </p>

<p>I feel he&#39;s something like <a href="https://archive.is/PoUMo">CaptainObviousMC</a> which I PM&#39;d rockran that&#39;s what I felt about him/her and that&#39;s how I got that response.</p>

<p>EDIT:  My bad, it was that other shill Roarian, not Rockran but I think they&#39;re the same person anyways.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For the longest time I gave everybody on this sub the benefit of a doubt - but the shilling after a while becomes obvious. The same usernames fighting the same agendas typically using abuse, etc. The really good ones are a little harder to spot, because they usually use the 80/20 rule - 80% truth and 20% disinfo. But their achilles heel is that they keep using the same combination of truth and lies and thus can be spotted after a while. </p>

<p>We have just to keep in mind what Lenin said - the best way to control the opposition is to be the opposition (not that I&#39;m a Lenin fan btw). In fact the shilling can be useful to us Goyim, because after a period of observation you can tell what their agenda and pressure points are which can reveal what the TPTB are thinking.</p>

<p>I&#39;m waiting to see what happens to that recent Stanley Kubrick confession video that came out a few weeks ago. Yes, there is some circumstantial stuff on that video that can&#39;t be explained and I myself was ready to dismiss it, but instead of using this their the advantage, the usual moonhoax conspiros heavily suppressed it (Jay Weidner, etc.) - which got my attention. Indeed, while the family has &#39;rubbished&#39; it - they haven&#39;t taken any legal action for impersonation (which is easy to do when you have a video of the impersonation). Funny thing was one aggressive shill challenged me to prove that impersonation was actually illegal. I&#39;m glad he did - because I dug up the law (NY state) and showed that impersonation (without permission) for a benefit is illegal - and clearly the filmmaker has benefited because he got funding for the interview. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because impersonation (for benefit) is illegal - wouldn&#39;t you think his estate would sue? I know I would. I guess so you can say it doesn&#39;t matter at this moment because it&#39;s not viral or anything. But years and years of rumors caused by that video will take a toll on that estate of his - at least reputation wise. I figured an easy legal injunction or cease/desist would shut this down immediately. Yet they have not done anything yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but what would make a NY state law applicable? Is the entity that created the video even in New York? I can&#39;t have you charged for breaking a Chinese law. Can you establish a tangible benefit? Is that benefit at a cost to an estate&#39;s worth? Would that even matter? </p>

<p>Whether or not portraying a dead person is legally crossing a line is always a matter of dispute. Many estates have tried to sue and failed (think every single biopic portrayal that didn&#39;t involve the decedent&#39;s estate). Generally they fail or take a small settlement to get them out of a film producer&#39;s hair.</p>

<p>According to your interpretation every biopic that ever portrayed a person in a negative light is illegal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Controlled opposition to any ideas or rumors that might be getting popular that may not paint an entity in a good light, these entities could be govts (both local and foreign, specifically an middle eastern country bordering the Mediterranean) or private individuals (like political candidates). Basically some rich person or powerbase pays people to monitor social media and push their own agenda or most like just sow disinformation (typically by mixing truth with lies). Is there documented proof? No, not yet (of course this would be complete black budget within govts). But as explained earlier in the thread, they can be spotted based on repeated patterns of behavior.</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is excellent for them because it sort of funnels such anti- establishment ideas into one place that can monitored and shilled. But like I explained earlier, over a period of time, shilling becomes easier to spot - and can even be used to decipher what the TPTB are thinking. It&#39;s an information battle.</p>

When you go on that kind of territory, the kind thinking it is more likely to have millions of people keeping a secret that huge rather than believing that it&#39;s just an unlikely theory, it is a very direct proof that you went full paranoia.</p>

<p>The goal of the shill is to derail the commentor from gaining traction and having a popular opinion.</p>

<p>And since most users don&#39;t change their filters, once a comment is downvoted past -4, then the comment gets buried.  What happens next are all the mindless bandwagoners start piling on the downvotes.</p>

<p>Like I&#39;ve said, it&#39;s not paranoia.  I&#39;ve provided a link where a user admits to what they do and I along with countless Redditors have been derailed by these shills.</p>

<p>Yes, according to CaptainObviousMC, it&#39;s very expensive to have paid shills sway the opinion the way they want but CaptainObviousMC does state that it is very effective.</p>

<p>Maybe I am, Maybe I&#39;m not but I&#39;ve been in many situations where the Redditor I&#39;m going back and forth would try and start a flame war and on 3 occasions, it seemed like I was talking to a bot becasuse their responses made no sense and were totally out of context to what we were talking about.</p>

<p>You can attribute that to paranoia all you want but it&#39;s something you would easily dismiss if it hasn&#39;t happened to you and I&#39;m going to assume that it isn&#39;t going to happen to you since it looks like you think conspiracies are bullshit.</p>

<p>But I&#39;ve learned to take my flame wars private but you know what?  These assholes take screenshots and then post it for other Redditors to see?   The only reason to do this is to try and gain support instead of going mono-a-mono.</p>

<p>How can you say that with the brief exchanges we&#39;ve had?  You have no idea what my ideaology is unless you&#39;re a stalker and have been monitoring my activities this whole time but I doubt that. </p>

<p>One thing about me is that I&#39;ve learned that anything is possible and everything has a bullshit element.  It&#39;s up to me to get the info and make the best educated decisions based on what I know, but that doesn&#39;t mean that what I think is concrete.  If I&#39;m proven wrong, I&#39;ll freely admit it and correct myself, in which I&#39;ve done many times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He says it is effective without any proof or argument of that. His bullshit post would have no weight if he said &quot;but it doesnt work&quot;.</p>

<p>Posts like that are created with that very specific goal : troll gullible people like you. The author is probably from 4chan. I&#39;ve been on threads or communities like this, where you target gullible people and toy with them. Conspiracy people are actually the ones able to trust anything, so you&#39;re the best audience.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve been in situations with dumb people. Your conclusion, again I need to say it for you to realize it, is that the cause is a secret worlwide organization whose goal is to troll people away from important matters.</p>

<p>So I&#39;ll take that theory. Tell me, who&#39;s behind the shilling on PCmasterrace ? On heroesofthestorm ? Who&#39;s paying user679 to post dumb things and troll on <a href="/r/kniting">/r/kniting</a> ? Obama ?</p>

<p>Finally, I&#39;ll come back to what should be the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> moto : possible is not likely. I&#39;ve said it&#39;s possible. I&#39;ve also said it is extremely unlikely, and that with zero argument or proof to back it up, the only sane action is to dismiss it. </p>

<p>But you trust the word of a stranger on the internet that provided no proof or argument. So yes, you trust shit. And that&#39;s actually the right word: &quot;shit&quot;.

<p>Decades of internet debating allow me to tell you that this is the average internet poster behavior. Not a bot, not a network with a secret agenda.</p>

<p>You&#39;re missing the point: the same exact behavior you believe is the one of a bot exists in environment where shilling has strictly no possibility to exist. It shows that what you think is bot behavior isn&#39;t.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Now this is deviating alot from what we were discussing. I never said all conspiracies are dumb. Some are actually valid, and what it takes to tell the 1% true from the 99% bullshit is what you&#39;re showing a lack of: the ability to analyze the proofs and arguments provided. The shilling conspiracy has none. Nothing else to see here. Also, if you actually believe the moon landings is a debate, you should consider that you are way too easily manipulated by conspiracy bullshit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No, to dismiss it without really investigating it for yourself makes your ass lazy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Alrighty then. I&#39;m lazy. You are not. You investigated, and found nothing, else you&#39;d shove it down the throat to anyone disbelieving, and furthermore, if you found anything, it&#39;d be on display on every media. Conspiracies that prove to be true are largely relayed by the media, Snowden says hello, and he&#39;s not an isolated example. So again: you have nothing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nobody in their right mind is going to explain every fucking detail of every conspiracy they know about because it&#39;s too much info to type into a small fucking text box and nobody has the time for that shit.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a fallacy. Everybody in their right mind would explain every fucking detail if it was actually anywhere near being true. The &quot;I don&#39;t have time to explain&quot; fallacy doesn&#39;t work. Either you have proofs and/or arguments, or you don&#39;t.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Ah, the mask falls. If I&#39;m not on the same side than you, I am not independent (I guess I must be brainwashed by the media ?) and I am a lemming. Nevermind that I carefully explained step by step how and why you&#39;re wrong to believe such a theory, I am the one here that is not thinking ! :)</p>

<p>You should try to reconsider your relation to conspiracy theories. You are displaying every sign of the blind believer: you believe anything crediting a theory with blind faith, and refute any form of proof existing discrediting with the hardest bad faith.</p>

<p>1) Do you agree that the way a kid is taught to think will affect his psyche for his entire life?</p>

<p>2) Do you agree that believing in Santa is exactly the same as believing in almost any other divine entity including Abraham ones (give or take a few minor details which are not important)?</p>

<p>I know several people who aren&#39;t stupid but still believe in an adult version of Santa. Some of them were brought up with this belief (which explains a lot), some were not. All of them were taught Santa is real at some point. It&#39;s extremely difficult for me to understand how a person without any serious mental health issues would come to believing in religious gods, but the Santa thing would explain a lot.</p>

<p>However, I&#39;m lacking a control group of people who were never forced into believing divine entities exist while in childhood, so this observation is not really scientific.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>If the kid actually believes he&#39;s Bruce Wayne (to a point his parents are worried), he will probably be diagnosed with a severe psychosis. But pretending for a while and then switching back is different. When I launch Fallout, I pretend to be a badass roaming the wastelands and oneshotting Deathclaws. In dialogs, I act the way I think the protagonist would act (for example, the real me would never do lots of things Badass me does, from killing people left and right to touching the baby in the very first scene). That does not mean I&#39;m unaware that it&#39;s all fake. Still fun.</p>

<p>No. Kids are malleable and people can change. </p>

<p>People have been believing in god or gods long before Santa came along. </p>

<p>If the kid doesn&#39;t grow out of it, i&#39;d agree with you. Kids believe all kinds of stupid shit that they grow out of. Some even think they have imaginary friends, big whoop. If they don&#39;t grow out of it, then be concerned. </p>

<p>But there would be something else in its place most of the time.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>But Santa is exactly the same as Jehovah and most other gods. </p>

<ul>
<li>If you do what a particular person tells you to do without questioning it, you will be rewarded by a mysterious entity with an unconfirmed link to that person.</li>
<li>Nobody has ever seen that entity or linked the reward to the entity. No proof of the entity&#39;s existence has ever existed. The confirmed rewards can always be easily explained without involving the entity.</li>
<li>There is zero explanation of how the entity dies what it does. </li>
<li>The existence of the entity directly contradicts what we know about nature. </li>
<li>There are lots of logical contradictions in the ideas (&quot;why do rich kids get better presents from Santa if the presents are determined by behavior and rich kids don&#39;t really behave better than poor kids?&quot;)</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>People have been believing in god or gods long before Santa came along.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>True, because Santa is a god no different from others.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some even think they have imaginary friends, big whoop.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s considered a sign of some relationship problems with his parents and is a mental health issue, although a minor one.</p>

<p>Why would you try to inflict another type of psychosis on a child, force him to believe in something nonexistent?</p>

<p>add:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But you&#39;re a grown person, not a little kid so things are different.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many grown men believe in gods. That&#39;s their brains malfunctioning, not a good thing. You should probably avoid forcing a child to accept these thought patterns.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tried telling my own child Santa doesn&#39;t exist and she didn&#39;t believe me. It would go in one ear, she would go to school/friends house and it would get pushed right out the other ear. It&#39;s pushed super hard in school. They made countdown chains, reindeer food to sprinkle the night before, a cookie for santa, wrote to Santa in school for the radio station and newspaper to publish, plus all the coloring sheets and activities they did on top of that. Her logic is that nobody would spend that much time convincing her of a lie because we consider lying a very big offense in our house.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>the fact you think its okay we we fucking lie to our kids?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely. </p>

<p>I told Timmy his drawing was great, it was fucking scribbles. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like the tooth fairy, just silly shit we tell our kids, they get a kick out of meeting Santa, or meeting Scooby Doo and other fantasy characters.</p>

<p>If a kid dresses up as a princess and plays pretend, do you slap them with reality and tell them it&#39;s just a costume and their bloodline isn&#39;t royalty? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>you buy each and every fucking Syrian refugee a gift from santa</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why would I do that? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Controlled opposition to any ideas or rumors that might be getting popular that may not paint an entity in a good light, these entities could be govts (both local and foreign, specifically an middle eastern country bordering the Mediterranean) or private individuals (like political candidates). Basically some rich person or powerbase pays people to monitor social media and push their own agenda or most like just sow disinformation (typically by mixing truth with lies). Is there documented proof? No, not yet (of course this would be complete black budget within govts). But as explained earlier in the thread, they can be spotted based on repeated patterns of behavior.</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is excellent for them because it sort of funnels such anti- establishment ideas into one place that can monitored and shilled. But like I explained earlier, over a period of time, shilling becomes easier to spot - and can even be used to decipher what the TPTB are thinking. It&#39;s an information battle.</p>
