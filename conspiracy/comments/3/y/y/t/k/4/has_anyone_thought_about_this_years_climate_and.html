    <div class="md"><p>Sorry about that. I&#39;m on my mobile and Reddit Is Fun glitches up on me sometimes and doesn&#39;t allow me to refresh. But you&#39;re right, but human influence on the initial changes in climate seem to be undeniable, which is what I&#39;m emphasizing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, we shouldn&#39;t be polluting, I agree. But the thing is, man is not affecting the climate like these charlatans are saying we are. It&#39;s a scam. The carbon trade stock market is going to make the elite even more wealth. It&#39;s not about the climate. It&#39;s about power/control/money. That being said, even if we add to and already natural cycle, there is nothing we can do about it. For all we know, doing something like HAARP, chemtrails, weather modification, etc etc. Could make the natural cycle even worse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your welcome. Basically what the cap and trade tax market would do is, give out a certain amount of credits to various industries/corporations. These credits can be bought/sold/and traded on a new &quot;wall street&quot;. We all know that wall street is a bubble/ponzi scheme. </p>

<p>This new market, however will be in the trillions. Just because a company sells off a credit, doesn&#39;t mean they will be obliged to actually not pollute to the cap set. They can make money buying selling/trading, and still pollute. It&#39;s a scam and does nothing for the environment. It&#39;s a scam and will make companies even more money.</p>

<p>This is kind of an eli5 explanation. There is a great short doc explaining it further. I&#39;m looking for it, so you can get a better understanding. Will edit when I find it.</p>

<p>Hope that helps, a little.</p>
