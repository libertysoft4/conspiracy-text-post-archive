    <div class="md"><p>Because inconvenient history is not history at all, it is wiped from the record and hopefully forgotten in time. How many Americans know we had foreknowledge of Pearl Harbor (yes even Pearl Harbor could&#39;ve been prevented) so why the fuck would they care now? The entire Vietnam war which many potential great Americans were lost in was waged on a farse, research the truth behind the Gulf of Tonkin. History is a fucking lie, that&#39;s why. But on a less dramatic note, it&#39;s hard to video tape something being done by those who control some of the most sophisticated technology and networks on the planet. Al-Queda has a hell of a computer team huh? America #1</p>

<p>You mean like John McCain and John Kerry, drug-addicts, criminals, psychos, and dregs of society? Anyone who was bright/sane/nos-psycho enough knew that the Vietnam war was unjust. Going miles away from your country to kill other human beings living poorly but simply who had enough of foreigners deciding what&#39;s good for them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anyway I admit that I have been too harsh. When one sees a wrong sometimes the mind shuts down and perceives everything to be classified into black, and white, as enemies to be killed/despised, or not. Just what probably happened to a lot of soldiers up to today , and definitely what happened to me, lumping all American soldiers with the nasties and the responsible officials. What I said was proof enough that humanity, compassion and empathy takes a back seat when emotions and thinking are prepped/triggered by aggression/hate/threat.  Again, I apologise. In  memory of the deceived fallen and the suffering survivors. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I&#39;ve heard of it. I also heard you can dodge it and go to jail. Just ask Cassius Clay. The ones who willingly went were psychos/bloodlusters or too naive easily fooled(they could probably be fooled into doing a lot of nasty things too)  into fighting for a non-defensive war. The ones who were &quot;forced&quot; saw abetting/participating industrial-scale murder as a preferable hell than jail. </p>

<p>There are a lot of things better to do for the country than fighting for an unjust war, even selfish/self-preservation reasons are waaay better. So yeah. Good riddance, I suppose. Salute to the National Guard and Militias, underpaid, underfunded and lacking recognition and praises but way more honorable than the idiots to be/deployed out of the homeland</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The plane was a Boeing 757-200. It is big, over half a football field long, about 125&#39; wingtip to wingtip, and the tail is 44&#39; tall. It has over 200 passenger seats, two titanium engines, a massive landing gear, and literally miles of wiring.  Here are the specs.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.boeing.com/history/products/757.page">http://www.boeing.com/history/products/757.page</a></p>

<p>Take a look at the Pentagon, after the floors collapsed.  Zoom in.</p>

<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Pentagon.Nach_Einsturz.Rasen.jpg">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Pentagon.Nach_Einsturz.Rasen.jpg</a></p>

<p>Look carefully. There are no wings, no engines, no landing gear, no tail, no seats, no wiring, no luggage, no bodies. There is no plane there.</p>

<p>Go to google images and look for yourself. If you search long enough, you will find a couple of scraps of aluminum. You may also find a few other pics of plane parts that were purportedly found at the Pentagon...but the Pentagon is absent from those pictures.</p>

<p>You see, there should be thousands of pictures and videos showing the plane. There are none.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.911myths.com/images/composite.jpg">This is the Pentagon <em>before</em> the floors collapsed</a>.  You can see the wire spools in front of the hole.  There are no &quot;wing holes&quot; nor is there a &quot;tail hole&quot;. </p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/TjvAl.jpg">This plane</a>, 125&#39; across, 44&#39; tall, and over half a football field long, did not go into <a href="http://www.911myths.com/images/composite.jpg">this hole</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think some people get tripped up in the wreckage photos and forget to think of other options. Who&#39;s to say if it was even a boeing 757. I believe a plane did impact the building, but theres a chance that it was something different than a 757. Look into the light poles knocked over as the plane decended and made it&#39;s approach. In order to knock those down you would have needed wings. One key thing to note is that the pilot voice recorded and flight data boxes that were found never had their serial numbers released. Without those serial numbers we can&#39;t tell what plane did hit it, but it backs up the plane impact story. Don&#39;t bother looking for the serials either, pretty sure people have filed and had their freedom of information act requests denied.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right. That&#39;s why there&#39;s a photo of the engine in the pentagon.</p>

<p>No. Have you? I really don&#39;t think any of those pieces of wreckage correspond to missile parts. If I&#39;m wrong please show me an example.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>What kind of missile are you referring to? For reference a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harpoon_missile">Harpoon missile</a> is 12.6 feet long while a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cessna_152">Cessna 152</a> is 24 feet 1 inch long. So the missile is only half as long as this specific small plane. If you&#39;re talking about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-7_Semyorka">R-7 Semyorka</a> however, then it&#39;s 112 feet long. Missiles vary greatly in size.</p>
