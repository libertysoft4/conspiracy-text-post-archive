<p>Complain all you want about numbers or content, regardless of politics voat attracts the sort of people that, in general, prefer less authoritarianism in the expression of ideas.  Those people are the ones that I want to interact with.</p>

<p>Also since FPH got banned I checked it out and lost 20 pounds.  If a forum is an authoritarian &quot;echo chamber&quot;, it might as well promote something like healthy living instead of Cultural Marxism.</p>

<p>Reddit is dead man, we have lost any and all semblance of control we ever had over it and it&#39;s time to move on.  Whether that&#39;s to Voat or back to forums or wherever you want to go is fine but trying to salvage this site is like trying to put out a tire fire.  The best you can do is find a new place to share ideas while trying as hard as you can to keep this sinking ship afloat until they finally put the clamps down hard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea. With the numbers, it just tried to grow to fast and every tried to create all the same subs on Voat that existed on Reddit. So a lot of them are empty without any posts for the past month.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure over time Voat will get their own subs totally different from Reddit. Over time, it too will hae to do a lot of the same thing Reddit does though to not turn into a chan-anonymous sess-pool.</p>

<p>As much as I hate the censorship in Reddit, anonymity leads to trolls. Just look at YouTube comments. I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s a bad thing. It&#39;s just a reality. I&#39;ve been working on an article about it; will post when I&#39;m done.</p>

<p>But yea, everyone should be on Voat...and here...and other sites. Don&#39;t put everything in one bucket. Go. Explore. Remember the time when people went to Lycos..then Hotbot...then Yahoo...back and forth to get different results.  </p>

<p>As for discussion, what do you think Reddit was like 4 or 5 years ago? This sub had less than 10,000 readers, most major subs had less than 5,000. If you&#39;re saying that you like to follow the crowd then so be it, but don&#39;t confuse quantity with quality. </p>

<p>For me, I use both for now, but I have dramatically cut back my Reddit use. I only visit a hand full of subs now and pretty much spend my time 50-50 between the two with my time on Voat increasing every week/month. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Realist?</p>

<p>&quot;Realism&quot; is an untenable view of the world. We can only experience the world via our senses and we make models of the world based on that subjective experience. The best we can do is know what is evident to our senses... claims about &quot;the real world&quot; are dubious. But very dogmatic people like to assert that they have somehow transcended the limitations of knowledge... they call themselves &quot;realist&quot; when in fact they are anything but.     </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You asserted that voat was for &quot;realist&quot; in response to my description of the racists views and attitudes of many of the contributers to voat. I assume you are saying that people who believe that white people are persecuted in Europe and the USA, who believe that muslims are taking over the west and who believe that men are oppressed by woman hold views that conform to the &quot;real world&quot; which is absurd on many many levels. The most basic way it is absurd is that nobody can know anything about the &quot;real world&quot;, we only know our perceptions of it.   </p>

<p>A belief in a clash of cultures implies the irreconcilable nature of intersubjectively-constituted <em>ways</em> of viewing the world.  He&#39;s culturally-biased, not a proponent of the philosophical position sometimes called &quot;naive realism.&quot; </p>
