    <div class="md"><p>People always bring up the moon landing as an example of a &quot;wacky&quot; conspiracy that could never happen. Probably because the lie is so great, no one thinks it could be pulled off. If the moon landing happened, there would be overwhelming scientific evidence that it happened. Instead, there&#39;s a massive amount of scientific anomalies. Here&#39;s a list of such anomalies:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>No evidence of any radiation other than visible light on the pictures.</p></li>
<li><p>No evidence that the PLSS ever vented any gas, water exhaust, or other materials</p></li>
<li><p>Insufficient shielding on the spacesuits to protect against ionizing radiation</p></li>
<li><p>Liftoff pattern as filmed by NASA shows a linear progression, rather than an exponential progression. (Exponential progression is how a rocket would act. Linear is how being lifted by a crane would act.)</p></li>
<li><p>No evidence that the liftoff engines used hypergolic fuels.</p></li>
<li><p>No explanation for how the LM weighed all the alleged moon rocks they brought back. (Fuel is precious, and they allegedly brought back hundreds of kilos of rock.) (EDIT: I did find a link to a scale - <a href="http://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11LM5structures.pdf">link</a>) </p></li>
<li><p>Dosimeter readings don&#39;t agree with modern radiation levels. (In other words, when the astronauts &quot;got back&quot;, the scientists said their dosimeter readings were within expected calculations. Then 30-40 years later, scientists find out the moon is much more radioactive than once believed. Why wasn&#39;t this reflected in the dosimeter readings?)</p></li>
<li><p>Insufficient shielding on the capsule to prevent against micrometeors</p></li>
<li><p>Insufficient shielding on the capsule to prevent against ionizing radiation</p></li>
</ul>

<p>That&#39;s just off the top of my head. There&#39;s many more. And this isn&#39;t taking into account the ludicrous engineering standards we&#39;re supposed to believe went into this. For example, the first time anyone tested how mammalian cells would behave beyond Earth&#39;s magnetosphere was allegedly on Apollo 8, when the first manned test of the Atlas V rocket was sent on a circumlunar orbit. It seems insane to test whether or not the environment outside Earth&#39;s magnetosphere is suitable for humans by sending humans as your first test subject.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s add to that that no other country has been back in 40+ years - despite the fact that technology increases over time, not decreases. We allegedly went to the moon 40 years ago but don&#39;t have the technology to do it now? (And the argument that it costs too much is moot. The proposed moon landing mission by Bush (which has since been cancelled) set a landing date of 2020 when first announced. Why such a long date? Why not use the tech that worked 6/7 times in the first place?)</p>

<p>Finally, the idea that Russia would &quot;blow the whistle&quot; as a counterargument to the above is insufficient. Not only does this not explain away any of the scientific anomalies. But one may argue (calling upon the work of Antony C. Sutton) that the US financed the USSR from Day 1, and that the cold war was a scam to line the pockets of the military industrial complex. One might also point out the great grain robbery of 1972, which also might buy a lot of silence from our alleged enemies.</p>

<p>If you think the moon landings happened, and think it&#39;s just too far fetched that this could have been faked, I urge you to do some basic research. The behaviour of NASA surrounding the Apollo missions is bizarre. (BTW, NASA lost all the original telemetry data and film footage of the alleged greatest engineering feat of all time. Whoops.)</p>

<p>The more research one does into this subject, the more obvious it becomes the moon landings never happened.</p>

<p>Finally, I will repeat, if the Apollo missions happened, there should be overwhelming evidence that it happened. One can view the multiple pieces of evidence, and the multiple anomalies, and decide for yourself. For me, there&#39;s just too many scientific anomalies that can&#39;t be explained away. These far outnumber and outweigh the arguments that show we went.</p>

<p>EDIT 2: The radiation questions are very thorny. This user has arguments in favor of the Apollo missions having sufficient shielding, and enough protection against ionizing radiation. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3y82df/the_moon_landing/cycrajm">link</a> </p>

<p>&quot;An investigation showed that United States Ambassador J. William Middendorf II had presented Drees with the &quot;moon rock&quot; on October 9, 1969. The Apollo 11 astronauts were visiting the Netherlands at that time on a goodwill tour. Drees&#39; grandson speculates that his grandfather formed the mistaken impression that the &quot;moon rock&quot; he received was from the Apollo 11 mission. When Drees&#39; &quot;moon rock&quot; was received by the Rijksmuseum in 1992, the museum phoned NASA to verify its provenance and was told over the phone, without seeing the piece, that it was &quot;possible&quot; it was a Moon rock.&quot;</p>

<p>So yeah. Some guy just gave some guy a lump of carbon and then sometime down the road they claimed it was a moon rock with zero verification.</p>

<p>The way a photograph works is that, for a brief moment, a photographic film is exposed to the elements. The light hitting the film will produce an image, properly developed. However, when this film is exposed, other sources of radiation will cause interference to this image. This is why, for example, you don&#39;t put your photos through the x-ray machine in the airport. Beyond Earth&#39;s magnetosphere, one would expect to see evidence of high-energy particles on these photos.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some expelled water is fed throughh a sublimator which leaves the suit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In your initial response, you claimed that nothing was expelled. I pointed out the error in your statement.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why must we see this small about of sublimating liquid?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn&#39;t say we <strong>must</strong> see evidence of this venting. I am saying there doesn&#39;t appear to be any evidence of this venting. By itself, this is not very damning.  But taken together with all the other anomalies will lead me to my conclusion. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Notice how they&#39;re completely different videos taken from two entirely different viewpoints, and more importantly, two completely different atmospheres.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The point of the two videos is to point out the difference in acceleration. One would expect both crafts to follow a similar pattern; slow at first and then speeding up. It costs more at the beginning per fuel than it does at any other point in the journey. I don&#39;t see evidence of this pattern in the Apollo video.</p>

<p>Indeed, as the moon has little to no atmosphere, the Apollo craft will need less fuel. But the LM is still heavy and should show that initial thrust. Regardless of the pattern of takeoff, there&#39;s still no evidence of thrust, in particular, a bright flame beneath the LM indicative of thrust. </p>

I see you didn&#39;t bother to actually look into that either.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed. I haven&#39;t done in depth research in this area. For example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Lunar_Module">wiki</a> entry doesn&#39;t list the scale as equipment. However, after a quick Google search, I found the 1969 Apollo 11 <a href="http://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11LM5structures.pdf">equipment listing</a>, which does have a scale.</p>

<p>You were the first person to challenge me on this point. Thank you! Because of this, I can eliminate this anomaly from my investigation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because they make good test subjects.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly. So why would NASA then use only humans to test circumlunar orbit? If they had used dogs and monkeys before on suborbital and orbital journeys, then one would expect them to use dogs and monkeys for circumlunar tests. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have this weird metric for calling something sufficient.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My point is that if we did it 6 times before, 40-some years ago, we should be able to do it again. This should be a scientific endeavour that is reproducible. What&#39;s more, as the Americans are able to do it, the Russians should be able to it as well. </p>

<p>This was done 40 years ago. Think of the technological difference between then and now. One would expect, due to improvements in technology and manufacturing, NASA would have gone again. Or Russia would have sent a manned mission. The idea is that society maintains its technological abilities as it moves forward. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh, so someone talking to someone on the phone is all they need?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In your initial statement you claimed that there was zero verification. I pointed out the error in your statement.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sure, if you&#39;ve made up your mind and don&#39;t know what a re-breather is, or that apollo missions took scales with them no amount of &quot;facts&quot; or &quot;logic&quot; or &quot;evidence&quot; will help you pull your head out of the sand.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m happy to admit when I&#39;m wrong. My whole argument is that if the Apollo missions happened, then there should be overwhelming scientific evidence that they did. Instead, I find there are more anomalies and high probabilities than what is expected. </p>

<p>You are free to disagree, of course. </p>

<p>Beyond Earth&#39;s magnetosphere, one would expect to see evidence of high-energy particles on these photos.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why would one &quot;expect&quot; that? You&#39;re making up all these nonpoints. The radiation on the moon was not significant to interfere noticeably with the processing of their film, which was designed to be done under such an environment. Buzz wasn&#39;t just snapping selfies with  a polaroid.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is why, for example, you don&#39;t put your photos through the x-ray machine in the airport</p>

<p>Liability. A single trip, even multiple trips will have no perceptible affect on your film.</p>

<p>And radiation gives you three eyes too, right?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In your initial response, you claimed that nothing was expelled. I pointed out the error in your statement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And you still have no idea what a rebreather is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I didn&#39;t say we must see evidence of this venting. I am saying there doesn&#39;t appear to be any evidence of this venting. By itself, this is not very damning.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>End of argument.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But taken together with all the other anomalies will lead me to my conclusion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Taken together with all the other ways I don&#39;t understand this, I pronounce this as hoax.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The point of the two videos is to point out the difference in acceleration. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The point of the two video is comparing two situations which, aside from them both being about vehicles leaving a surface, couldn&#39;t be less alike.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One would expect both crafts to follow a similar pattern; slow at first and then speeding up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And you can glean this from the footage of the lunar ascent module? (Hint, you can&#39;t. Not using the angle the camera follows the craft). However, reading the <em>readily available</em> data about its trajectory, one gets a much better picture of just what was going on.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>should show that initial thrust.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It did. Where it zooms into space.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Regardless of the pattern of takeoff, there&#39;s still no evidence of thrust,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh you mean like where it launches itself into space?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a bright flame beneath the LM indicative of thrust.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh you mean like the very clear moment of liftoff where propellants are seen ejected from the craft? Or their engines&#39; characteristic &quot;clear&quot; flame which undergo full-operation (and thus clean burning) in a very short amount of time? Of course, watchin as the module changes its pitch you can quite easily see the flame.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Indeed. I haven&#39;t done in depth research in this area.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So your obvious answer was &quot;wow NASA I clearly see through hour lies. They had no scale how&#39;d the bring back all those rocks!!&quot;</p>

<p>As if NASA were going to go through all that trouble of fabricating such a hoax and just leaving that part out. Quickly, get on the horn with Neil and tell him to make up some lie about a scale....</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For example, the wiki entry doesn&#39;t list the scale as equipment. However, after a quick Google search, I found the 1969 Apollo 11 equipment listing, which does have a scale.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe reconsider incomplete wikipedia articles as part of your &quot;investigation&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Exactly. So why would NASA then use only humans to test circumlunar orbit? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dogs can only provide so much feedback.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If they had used dogs and monkeys before on suborbital and orbital journeys, then one would expect them to use dogs and monkeys for circumlunar tests.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why would one expect that?</p>

<p>The plan was never to send dogs to the moon.</p>

<p>At some point there would be a first human up there.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My point is that if we did it 6 times before, 40-some years ago, we should be able to do it again</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And we can do it again.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This should be a scientific endeavour that is reproducible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What&#39;s more, as the Americans are able to do it, the Russians should be able to it as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And if they want to, they might try.</p>

<p>Can and should are different words.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One would expect, due to improvements in technology and manufacturing, NASA would have gone again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why would one expect that?</p>

<p>They went. They accomplished their mission (mission being: go to the moon). You don&#39;t keep at it one it&#39;s already done if there&#39;s no reason to. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In your initial statement you claimed that there was zero verification. I pointed out the error in your statement.</p>

<p>An anonymous phone call is not verification.</p>

<p>You not understanding a very simple concept isn&#39;t an anomaly.</p>

Well since Wikipedia is &quot;garbage&quot; that you refuse to read, here it is straight from wiki.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Apollo 11 telemetry tapes were different from the telemetry tapes of the other Moon landings because they contained the raw television broadcast. For technical reasons, the Apollo 11 lander carried a slow-scan television (SSTV) camera (see Apollo TV camera). To broadcast the pictures to regular television, a scan conversion had to be done. The radio telescope at Parkes Observatory in Australia was able to receive the telemetry from the Moon at the time of the Apollo 11 moonwalk.[138] Parkes had a bigger antenna than NASA&#39;s antenna in Australia at the Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station, so it received a better picture. It also received a better picture than NASA&#39;s antenna at Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex. This direct TV signal, along with telemetry data, was recorded onto one-inch fourteen-track analog tape at Parkes. The original SSTV transmission had better detail and contrast than the scan-converted pictures, and it is this tape that is missing.[143] A crude, real-time scan conversion of the SSTV signal was done in Australia before it was broadcast worldwide. However, still photos of the original SSTV image are available (see photos). About fifteen minutes of it were filmed by an amateur 8 mm film camera and these are also available. Later Apollo missions did not use SSTV. At least some of the telemetry tapes from the ALSEP scientific experiments left on the Moon (which ran until 1977) still exist, according to Dr. Williams. Copies of those tapes have been found.</p>

<p>Others are looking for the missing telemetry tapes for different reasons. The tapes contain the original and highest quality video feed from the Apollo 11 landing. Some former Apollo personnel want to find the tapes for posterity, while NASA engineers looking towards future Moon missions believe the tapes may be useful for their design studies. They have found that the Apollo 11 tapes were sent for storage at the U.S. National Archives in 1970, but by 1984 all the Apollo 11 tapes had been returned to the Goddard Space Flight Center at their request. The tapes are believed to have been stored rather than re-used. Goddard was storing 35,000 new tapes per year in 1967, even before the Moon landings.</p>

<p>And? You think every single one of those people knew every single detail of the program? Even without faking it, most of those people would have no idea what was going on except for what they were told by their superiors.</p>

<p>No and I never stated that I did, but when you look at the shear number of people who worked on the Apollo program, if there was really a conspiracy, we would certainly know by now. The government couldn&#39;t even silence everyone involved with Watergate, how could they silence potentially 400,000 people who directly worked on the project, let alone all the military, congressional and executive intelligence involved? </p>

<p>Straight from wiki, Backgrounds were not identical, just similar. What appear as nearby hills in some photos are actually mountains many miles away. On Earth, objects that are further away will appear fainter and less detailed. On the Moon, there is no atmosphere or haze to obscure faraway objects, thus they appear clearer and nearer. Furthermore, there are very few objects (such as trees) to help judge distance.</p>

<p>Alright so your telling me that NASA would have never caluclated that out from the get go? Do you have a source to back up that claim?  </p>

<p>No I am saying that the over abundance of facts and the shear amount of people who worked on the Apollo missions make the whole &quot;Moon Landing Conspiracy&quot; incredibly unlikely and near impossible from contracting this evidence.  </p>

<p>How would NASA know ahead of time how much the moon rocks would weigh? My point here is that NASA claimed to have brought back hundreds of kilos of moon rock - but they had no way to know how much each moon rock weighed. This idea is ludicrous - they could be off by a few kilograms and therefore have insufficient fuel to liftoff.</p>

<p>Because their not pizza faced fedora wearing people who are not employed or schooled that live in their mother&#39;s basement. We are talking the biggest and brightest people here, also there were soil samples taken from previous missions, coupled with the fact that they calculated the amount of materials they could take back to earth.

<p>I&#39;m not saying that they would, straight from wiki again it would have been much easier to really land on the Moon than to generate such a huge conspiracy to fake the landings. There has been nobody from the United States government or NASA who has a link to the Apollo program has said the Moon landings were hoaxes. With the number of people that would have had to be involved, someone would have outed the hoax by now. Look a the Watergate scandal, there is no way the government could not have silenced everyone if the landings were faked, especially with the shear amount of people involved.</p>

<p>I claim that it&#39;s impossible for NASA to calculate ahead of time the weight of a rock on the moon. According to this <a href="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/lunar/missions/apollo/apollo_11/samples/">link</a> Apollo 11 brought back 22 kg of rock. This was the first alleged landing on the moon. How did NASA know the soil composition ahead of time? How did NASA know the weight of the rocks ahead of time without knowing the composition? How did NASA test their alleged calculations without a scale onboard the LM?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Would you like to provide any evidence for the claims that you are pushing?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are asking me to prove a negative. If I claim that, for instance, that there&#39;s no evidence of any other radiation on the photos other than visible light, how would I go about proving that? On the other hand, you can invalidate my claim by showing a photo where there is some other sort of radiation.</p>

<p>Well yeah, but how about trying to fake it when over 400,000 people worked on the Apollo Missions, even if only 1% of the people who worked on it &quot;knew the truth&quot;, we are taking about 4,000 people keeping their mouths shut on one of the most widely discussed conspiracies to date. If 3 people couldn&#39;t keep a secret that the President was getting head from one of his interns, how in the hell could this secret last so long?

<p>Again, the number of people working on the project does not necessarily mean all these people would know every aspect of the project. The idea that a large agency can&#39;t keep a secret is largely invalidated by the success of the Manhattan project - another large government project, worked on by a vast majority of people, which was kept secret throughout it&#39;s duration. Moreover, how many secrets do you think are currently kept by the CIA, NSA, etc... </p>

<p>Regardless, let&#39;s accept the premise that so many people were necessarily in on the secret. Put that in the &quot;evidence for&quot; pile. There still remains a large amount of scientific anomalies that can&#39;t be explained away.</p>

<p>Again not trying to sound arrogant, but look at my post history. Finally, if the moon landings were staged and their is an over abundance of evidence to showcase that, don&#39;t you think it would have been in the best interests of the Soviets to discover that information and broadcast it to the world? They had no incentive to showcase evidence for the validity that the moon landings took place, yet they still did. If there is even half the amount of speculation that the moon landings were staged, it would have been greatly in the U.S.S.R.&#39;s best interests to provide that, I think you and I could agree that information would have been slightly damaging to the U.S.&#39;s image/influence in the world during the Cold War.</p>

<p>Again how many people worked on this project and how long did this secret exactly last? Oh yeah we definitely knew about it when we dropped the Atomic Bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, just like how we definitely knew when we you know actually landed on the moon. Do you seriously have the audacity to essentially call Neil Armstrong and Buzz Armstrong statist shills who lied to help propogate Americana influence around the world, give me a break?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will refer you to the work of Antony C. Sutton which shows that the US financed the Soviet revolution. One can theorize that the cold war was largely an exercise to generate money for the military industrial complex. Further, one can point to the great grain robbery of 1972, which might provide some explanation as to why the Soviets didn&#39;t &quot;blow the whistle.&quot; </p>

<p>Moreover, if we assume the cold war were real, how would &quot;blowing the whistle&quot; have helped the Soviets. The Soviets were the enemy - one can assume the US would explain away the Soviets reasoning as enemy propaganda. Not to mention that such damaging information would be better used as blackmail. Further, this was the height of the cold war. Calling out the Americans could have drastic, nuclear consequences.</p>

<p>But regardless of the actions or inactions of the Soviets, this still does not explain away the large number of scientific anomalies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Radiation hardening is an extensive topic, so I&#39;ll try and be as brief as possible.</p>

<p>By today&#39;s standards Apollo did need shielding.</p>

<p>If you read what I linked (edit: on mobile, thought you were somebody else) you&#39;d have seen Apollo&#39;s strategy was simply to monitor solar radiation and space weather, then to launch the mission at a time when there was a low chance of high radioactive activity.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a bit like looking at a weather forecast and saying there&#39;s a low chance of rain and not taking an umbrella.</p>

<p>Only in this case if it does rain you die.</p>

<p>In the 60&#39;s, in the middle of the space race, this was an acceptable risk. Now standards are far, far stricter and this -even though 99% of the time it&#39;s safe- is a completely unacceptable risk.</p>

<p>Hell I have to sign off a health and safety forms, wear protective gear and use three inch thick lead walls when doing practical work with radioactive sources about as powerful as a banana, standards today are insanely high. </p>

<p>There&#39;s also the instrumentation aspect. 60&#39;s instruments were far less complex and hardier, a few state charged particles would bother them a bit but not much.</p>

<p>Modern technology is far more complicated, tiny interferences and ruin your readings or just flat out destroy the instrument.</p>

<p>Advances in technology are another reason more shielding is needed.</p>

<p>Modern launch vehicles, as well as modern improvements on shielding (it&#39;s not just lead anymore, active radiation shielding is cool as fuck and basically involves force fields deflecting ionising radiation) mean that it&#39;s viable for Orion to actually be properly shielded.</p>

<p>So, where Apollo couldn&#39;t be shielded, Orion can, where Apollo didn&#39;t really need to be shielded, Orion does.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay then, why would they need shielding?</p>

<p>Please enlighten me. Tell me why shielding would be needed for Apollo, give me the estimated radiation doses, say &quot;Clearly they&#39;re too highly&quot; and then conclude &quot;Shielding is needed&quot;.</p>

<p>You won&#39;t be able to, since the estimated radiation doses weren&#39;t too high. Unless an unexpected solar event happened and everybody died, that would have been a bit awkward.</p>

<p>Which is why Orion is doing it properly, so that everybody doesn&#39;t just die in case something random and quite unlikely does happen. </p>

<p>By <strong>1960&#39;s standards</strong> shielding wasn&#39;t <em>needed</em> since they would <strong>probably</strong> be fine.

<p>By <strong>today&#39;s standards</strong> shielding <em>is</em> needed since <strong>probably</strong> isn&#39;t good enough, you need to be sure they <strong>will be fine regardless of what happens</strong>. Which is why seatbelts, hard hats, steel toed boots, fire resistant doors, fire extinguishers, etc, etc, etc, are all <strong>required by health and safety laws now when they were not required in the 60&#39;s</strong>.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Okay, I&#39;ll give you this point, I thought what I was saying was clear but I see why it might not be clear for everybody.</p>

<p>When I talk about radiation shielding I typically mean <strong>additional</strong> radiation shielding, like layers of lead or layers of a composite material <strong>designed specifically</strong> to prevent radiation passing through.</p>

<p>Apollo had <strong>no additional radiation</strong> shielding.</p>

<p>However Apollo did have its hull, and the hull provided some shielding, while not explicitly being designed as radiation shielding.</p>

<p>The hull does, by being a decently thick bit of metal, act as a form of radiation shielding. Shit, a sheet of paper or basically any material can act as radiation shielding.</p>

<p>Apollo&#39;s hull provided enough radiation shielding for the mission to fall within the 60&#39;s safety &#39;standards&#39;, as long as no unexpected solar flares went off at the wrong time and killed the instruments as well as everybody onboard.</p>

<p>Orion, however, will have proper radiation shielding, designed explicitly to be and act as radiation shielding, it looks like Orion will use the following technology for its shielding:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The American Radiation Eradication in Space (ARES) team created a 7” cubic shield called the Tesseract. It will house and protect a dosimeter from radiation while in flight. The final incarnation will be made of Tantalum, Tin, Zirconium, Aluminum, and Polyethylene. The heavy metals will block gamma rays while ions and neutrons are captured by the hydrocarbons of the polyethylene. The students selected their materials based on cost, malleability, machinability, weight, and abundance. Thanks to CAD models, the design was made to have flanges and bolts which allow the Tesseract to be strong, easily produced, and opened.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve been focusing on Earth-orbiting spacecraft and the VA belts (since that&#39;s what this discussion, and the original video, was about), but keep in mind that Orion is designed to go to deep space, not just the moon. So the Apollo-era style of &quot;Let&#39;s time it right and hope no solar events happen, killing everybody on board&quot; combined with the harsh radiation environment of outer space mean Orion would need shielding even by the terrible standards of the 60&#39;s, as the chance of Orion being fine without shielding for an extended deep space mission is essentially zero.</p>

<p>Any more questions on the scientific side? The &#39;fake&#39; moon rocks and &#39;fake&#39; footage (even the one <a href="https://youtu.be/Pqi5ckFr1Ow?t=1m10s">OP linked as &#39;evidence&#39;</a> for the landing being fake is moronic and obviously made by a blind guy, since you can clearly see the astronaut getting up <strong>pushing on the other one with his own hand</strong>) has been analysed to death and always been debunked.</p>

<p>Edit: Just thought of a decent example which should clarify things, I hope:</p>

<p>Any material really has some inherent amount of radiation it blocks. Just like everything has a mass/weight. We have weights designed as &#39;weights&#39;, designed to be lifted to get swole gainz, a dice also has a weight, but nobody would life dice to get fit, so even though it has weight it is not itself a &#39;weight&#39;.</p>

<p>In the same way Apollo block&#39;s radiation since it&#39;s made of metal, so its hull shields against radiation, but it is not a radiation shield. </p>

<p>And the amount blocked by just the construction of Apollo was enough to deem it &#39;safe&#39; without additional shielding.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. Like I said, the chances of something going wrong were low, but low in the 60&#39;s is ridiculously high by today&#39;s standards.</p>

<p>The main risk was an unexpected solar event just... killing everybody. The sun was being monitored and the mission was timed for a period of low activity, but by today&#39;s standards saying &quot;Yeah you probably won&#39;t die, unless this happens, but the chance of that is like... one in a hundred.

<p>If something unexpected did happen they had essentially no protection. 60&#39;s logic just says &quot;Well shit it&#39;s unexpected, probably won&#39;t happen&quot;, today&#39;s logic is &quot;Prepare for literally every single thing that could possibly go wrong or we&#39;ll lose our funding and get sued to hell even if nothing goes wrong&quot;</p>

<p>Tolerances today are stupidly strict. It&#39;s good they&#39;re there, but they are awkward, to the point where when I&#39;m working with radioactive sources I have to take a ridiculous number of precautions, even though the source is weaker than a fucking banana... </p>

<p>Yep. And compared to the Apollo program, two major space shuttle accidents out of 135 missions vs... oh wait you&#39;re the guy I replied to before. Basically answered this in my other reply.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What kind of equipment was being used to monitor the sun?</p>

<p>Something I have <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/tnD7080RadProtect.pdf">already cited</a>. Repeating myself is quite tiring, especially as all of this information is publicly available online and only takes a few seconds of searching to get.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A system of solar monitoring stations, the Solar Particle Alert Network (SPAN), provides a NASA sponsored network of continuous data on solar-flare activity. The various components of this network are described in the appendix (<em>this covers two A4 pages of writing, see above linked paper and scroll to the appendix</em>). Approximately 20 percent of the largest solar flares (importance 2 bright or larger) will result in particle fluxes in the earth/moon region that can be related in intensity to early RF or visual characteristics.</p>

<p>A warning interval of from less than one to several hours (typically, 2 to 5 4 hours) is obtained between the RF /visual indication and the appearance of particles in the earth/moon region. Because only approximately 20 percent of the flares result in particle events, it is not necessary to change normal mission procedures on the basis of RF or visual observations alone. Rather, radiation sensors on board solar orbit and earth-orbit satellites, as well as on board the Apollo spacecraft itself, are used to confirm the particle event. Only after the appearance of particles is confirmed would action be taken to protect the crewmen. For a typical event, approximately 8 hours would be available from the time particles are confirmed to the time of peak radiation dose.</p>

<p>Yes. You said Apollo 13. On Apollo 13 an oxygen tank exploded. It had nothing to do with the radiation environment, which is what I was talking about in the post where you quoted me saying &quot;If anything unexpected [<em>in regards to solar activity</em>] happened [<em>if they were in a location too far away from Earth to return to safety in time</em>] they would have all died&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No, it doesn&#39;t, which is why I used independent data to check the position of Apollo 17.</p>

<p>And good luck keeping over two hundred thousand scientists and engineers quiet about faking the moon landings. As you&#39;ve probably noticed from my posts, scientists and engineers tend to be quite passionate about the truth and facts, if there was the slightest doubt about what they were doing somebody would have mentioned something.</p>

<p>Or, at the very least, another scientist later on would have looked at the data and said it was clearly faked, and then every single scientist or engineer could independently check their math, statements and assumptions. That&#39;s the beauty of science.</p>

<p>Saying that the government has lied in the past about various things has no direct link to the Apollo program being fake.</p>

<p>What the OP of this thread asked for was solid evidence that Apollo is fake, not flaky reasoning like that.</p>

<p>I came here looking for that evidence, and didn&#39;t find any.</p>

<p>&quot;Where&#39;s the evidence?!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;LACK OF EVIDENCE IS EVIDENCE!&quot;</p>

<p>Nope.</p>

<p>And, yet again, there are things that you literally cannot fake. Like doppler readings off of the Apollo missions confirming their speed and altitude, and confirming they landed, done by independent researchers over the world, including the Russians. Or, again, independent pictures of Apollo re-entering.</p>

<p>It&#39;s quite hard to find a source since the NASA website isn&#39;t going to state that they&#39;re compartmentalized but I found this:</p>

<p>So NASA couldn&#39;t take care of one of the most monumental moments in history by making sure that the tapes didn&#39;t get erased?</p>

<p>As smart of a guy you are, are you going to believe that someone or a group of people decided not to look to see what&#39;s on a previously used tape before they started to record over it?</p>

<p>And they claim to have copies that look better than the original?  The ony way that would happen is if they were digitally enhanced and this adds a layer of uncertainty as far as authenticity goes.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s talking about a reorganisation in 2005, not the structure NASA had in the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s during Apollo.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If you read through the entire story, then yes, I see how that mistake could happen.</p>

<p>The tapes were only a temporary backup anyway. They were not intended to be kept or used in the future, they were only there in case the live broadcast failed, in fact there was a large discussion at NASA over if the camera should even be sent since it served literally no scientific purpose.</p>

<p>Either way, the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Apollo_11_Tapes_Report.pdf">full report</a> on the search for the tape answers quite a lot of questions.</p>

<p>Essentially the tapes only existed in the first place because a conversion needed to be made to allow the broadcast to be sent to normal TV&#39;s, they were then taken in a massive batch of over 200,000 tapes set to be recycled.</p>

<p>It&#39;s quite hard to notice something&#39;s important if all you have to go by is a cryptic name like &quot;AP11-LCT-0001&quot;.</p>

<p>Either way, the original tapes still exist for the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a14/video14.html">other missions</a>, so the argument that they were lost on purpose to hide something doesn&#39;t work too well as there are tapes for the rest of the missions.</p>

<p>Even the original quality is still quite shite: <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a14/a14v.1350943.rm">https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a14/a14v.1350943.rm</a></p>

<p>Hmmm, that statement doesn&#39;t sound to me that compartmentalization accomplished very little.  In fact, if manipulation to direct and control research was the goal, then compartmentalization is a success.</p>

<p>Compartmentalization has gone back to at least WW2 so it&#39;s not out of the question that it would have been implemented during the 60&#39;s NASA era.</p>

<p>So our Military has been filming war footage as far back as WW2 for archival purposes but our govt doesn&#39;t see any significance in archiving moon footage?  I feel you&#39;re stretching things a bit.</p>

<p>On top of that, how are you going to defend the erasing of the moon footage when you didn&#39;t even know about it until now.  All you did was do a little research after I pointed to a source and then you found some source of your own and are going with it?  I&#39;ve said this before but you aren&#39;t that skeptical at all.</p>

<p>Just to broadcast it live, since some thought it would be a good idea. Which is exactly why nobody bothered with the tapes further than just having them there as a backup if the broadcast failed.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No, it&#39;s not, but that still doesn&#39;t mean that -if it was done to a large extent- it was done in an effort to split up scientists so that nobody could discover the massive conspiracy of the moon landings being faked...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>govt doesn&#39;t see any significance in archiving moon footage? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obviously they do care, since it was broadcast live to millions of people and recorded multiple times. What nobody cared about was the original footage as it served no scientific purpose and its only use was to be converted to a format that could be sent out live, and as a backup in case the live failed.</p>

<p>Even if the backup had to be used it would need to be converted again, so it was pointless to keep an un-converted copy.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I knew it was missing, just never really cared since it&#39;s not a big deal, things get erased all the time and those tapes weren&#39;t intended as main tapes, they were a form of temporary backup. And all the original tapes from the future Apollo missions are available.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve said this before but you aren&#39;t that skeptical at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the science didn&#39;t line up, I would be sceptical. But the science works perfectly fine, and all of the raw data is perfectly fine, and all of the independent readings are fine. Missing tapes for one out of the six missions is not enough to make me doubt the moon landings happened.</p>

<p>Actual scientific data disagreeing with the narrative would be enough.</p>

<p>No, it&#39;s not, not with engineers anyway. Compartmentalization doesn&#39;t limit any information flow. It just says &quot;You&#39;re the power systems engineer? Great, then you&#39;re put here with the rest of the power systems engineers&quot;. Here&#39;s the <a href="http://imgur.com/g8M4Yen">contents page from one of my spacecraft engineering books</a>, it&#39;s chaos if you just shove four hundred thousand employees together and say &quot;Go on build Apollo then!&quot;</p>

<p>You split them into groups, like propulsions, structure, attitude, thermals, comms, whatever, then all of the group <strong>constantly cooperate</strong>. You cannot stop different systems designers from talking to each other, otherwise you end up with something that literally cannot be built.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So just forget archival footage then, huh?</p>

<p>The converted footage was archived.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t remember when science explained why there wasn&#39;t a blast crater underneath the spacecraft when it landed on the moon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why would there be? Apollo&#39;s landing engines were extremely weak, since Apollo was relatively &#39;light&#39; and gravity on the moon&#39;s weak you didn&#39;t need some Ariane-V-level of Earth-cracking thrust.</p>

<p>Just from experience there&#39;s no reason for there to be a &#39;crater&#39;, either way I&#39;m sure somebody has done the math on this already.</p>

<p>And they have:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>First, some numbers: The lunar module (LM) descent stage engine had a maximum thrust of 9870 ft-lb, but this was throttleable back to a minimum of 1050 ft-lb. Sounds like a lot. But, the diameter of the nozzle was 63 inches, which is an area of about 3120 in2. Dividing this into the force (thrust) and you have a pressure range of 0.4-3.2 ft-lb/in2, otherwise known as psi. This is equivalent to the metric 2760-22,100 N/m2. But let’s stick with psi.</p>

<p>Anyone who owns a car probably knows that this is already significantly less than your tire pressure … by a factor of 10-100. When Apollo 11 landed, the thrust was down to about 1/3 of max, so down to around 1 psi.</p>

<p>Now let’s look at the average adult footstep: The average non-American weighs around 150 lbs. The average human footprint is around 50 in2 (don’t believe me? do the math yourself!). Divide the first into the second and you have the average human footstep exerting a simple 3 psi.</p>

<p>This is 3x larger than Apollo’s engines!!</p>

<p>The very fact that the astronauts walking on the moon did not create “blast craters” underneath them should be explanation enough as to why the engine did not create a blast crater under it — the pressure was simply too low.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s with all the new user accounts trying to get other people banned for schoolyard insults? I mean they are literally sock puppets <em>begging</em> to have someone else banned.</p>

<p>And what&#39;s with multiple users pressuring a mod to do something, then mocking them for not doing it? How about fuck off bro, go mod your own subreddit. Did Timmy steal your favorite swing again? Never seen such petty forum goers in all my life.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the shit post Anti_Vaccination made to <a href="/r/TopMindsOfReddit">/r/TopMindsOfReddit</a> mocking your behavior:</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/3yl7yp/top_mod_refuses_to_ban_member_who_continuously/cyeeq81">https://np.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/3yl7yp/top_mod_refuses_to_ban_member_who_continuously/cyeeq81</a></p>

<p>He actually tries to suggest the user was an alt of mine.</p>

<p>So who is Anti_Vaccination? Notice how he never participated in the discussion here, but made a shit-post to <a href="/r/TopMindsOfReddit">/r/TopMindsOfReddit</a> about it? That tells me he wasn&#39;t just lurking, he was probably one of the sock puppets in this thread. It wouldn&#39;t be surprising, since I exposed him last week for using multiple sock puppets to harass other users. He deleted most of the accounts, but still has his main account P51Mike1980.</p>

<p>So that&#39;s my observation after showing up late here to the party. You can delete this comment if you want, I don&#39;t care.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t kept up with Orion much so I&#39;m not sure what their plans are (doubt it&#39;s this since last time I checked it was just an idea) but these are some active shielding plans I know of: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Confined/unconfined magnetic shielding </p></li>
<li><p>Plasma shielding </p></li>
<li><p>Electrostatic shielding </p></li>
</ul>

<p>There might be newer ideas since I last looked at this topic, but search for any of those and you&#39;ll get a couple of papers on each. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Active shielding still is I believe.</p>

<p>But Orion has moved away from the 60&#39;s era &quot;Lead is best&quot; thinking to more advanced protection, not as advanced as active shielding, but better than just slapping a few tonnes of lead on. </p>

<p>Right now it looks like a more refined version of the following plan will be used for Orion:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The American Radiation Eradication in Space (ARES) team created a 7” cubic shield called the Tesseract. It will house and protect a dosimeter from radiation while in flight. The final incarnation will be made of Tantalum, Tin, Zirconium, Aluminum, and Polyethylene. The heavy metals will block gamma rays while ions and neutrons are captured by the hydrocarbons of the polyethylene. The students selected their materials based on cost, malleability, machinability, weight, and abundance. Thanks to CAD models, the design was made to have flanges and bolts which allow the Tesseract to be strong, easily produced, and opened.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is precisely why it must be tested. The shielding is new and should work, in theory, but theory needs to be backed up by practical tests. </p>

Or maybe I&#39;m retarded when I laugh out loud when they say that man made a 4000 mph descent from lunar orbit to stick a vertical landing using 1960s technology with absolutely no symmetrical testing.

<p>That video was about the Orion spacecraft. Shockingly when saying &quot;We must solve these challenges&quot; they&#39;re talking about Orion, not Apollo.

<p>And if you need different levels of shielding then the challenges of shielding Orion are different.</p>

<p>That video saying &quot;Couldn&#39;t they just use technology from the Apollo missions or the same shielding as it must have worked back in 69&#39;?&quot; is the same as Bugatti saying &quot;We need new technology for our car&quot; and some moron replying with &quot;Well, couldn&#39;t you just use the same tech from this Ford car?

<p>I don&#39;t know why you think it&#39;s up anyone to prove that NASA didn&#39;t go to the moon; it&#39;s up to NASA to prove they went.</p>

<p>You know, not go through long drawn out examples of how it&#39;s different now, but just show the shielding used and how it worked. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t have that though. So you can&#39;t. Instead, you have to string together a bunch of nonsense.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not your fault. NASA didn&#39;t give you the tools to prove they went to the moon, because they can&#39;t give them to you. There&#39;s no solid evidence that NASA went. All &quot;evidence&quot; suggesting they did is utterly corrupted.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Well, I can.</p>

<p>Here are the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/tnD7080RadProtect.pdf">publicly available documents from NASA on protection against radiation for the Apollo mission</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/lunar/documents/NTRS/collection3/NASA_CR_106949.pdf">
Here&#39;s another publicly available document</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.braeunig.us/space/69-19.htm">And another</a>.</p>

<p>Essentially, with what was available to them then, no amount of shielding could have helped (in fact trying to shield would be harmful), so the next best option was to go through the belts as fast as possible, at a time with low solar activity and decent space weather predictions, and hope nothing broke and that none of the astronauts got cancer and died later on.</p>

<p>Why wouldn&#39;t shielding help? I&#39;ll be as brief as possible.</p>

<p>There are <a href="http://www.remnet.jp/english/lecture/b03_01/images/seishitu.gif">four main kinds of radiation</a>.</p>

<p>Alpha fucks shit up, but gets stopped by almost anything, so the spacecraft&#39;s exterior was enough.</p>

<p>Beta fucks shit up less badly, but would still be stopped by the exterior (mostly).</p>

<p>Gamma usually just goes through everything, but if it interacts then it fucks everything up since it releases different kinds of radiation <em>inside of you/the components</em>. Stopping it would need too much shielding, so the best option is to reduce what it can interact with and hope it just goes through everything.</p>

<p>Same-ish for neutron.</p>

<p>NASA probes showed that there was far less radiation in the VA belt than expected, and that if they went through fast enough then shielding wouldn&#39;t be needed.</p>

<p>It was an insanely stupid risk by today&#39;s standards, which is why Orion is doing it properly this time. Although it&#39;ll still go through as fast as possible to reduce exposure.</p>

<p>Boom. Eat it.</p>

<p>You know, there&#39;s this other user Rorian that is just like you and he totally agrees with the narrative.</p>

<p>But Roarian has presented evidence that you don&#39;t address or even mention which is trajectory used to &quot;skirt&quot; around the Van Allen Belt:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;amp;v=YuH4rxda3Z4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;amp;v=YuH4rxda3Z4</a></p>

<p>Also, I found this on the NASA website in which you also don&#39;t address or even mention:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Van Allen belts were the first discovery of the space age, measured with the launch of a US satellite, Explorer 1, in 1958. In the decades since, scientists have learned that the size of the two belts can change – or merge, or even separate into three belts occasionally. But generally the inner belt stretches from 400 to 6,000 miles above Earth&#39;s surface and the outer belt stretches from 8,400 to 36,000 miles above Earth&#39;s surface.</p>

<p>So how could NASA have predicted what shape the belt was going to be in before they launched any of the spacecrafts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yeah, the trajectory was another aspect of it, a course was chosen which avoided the most dangerous areas like the South Atlantic Anomaly. </p>

<p>And the predictions were made using the original readings from Explorer (which, as your source said, was launched in 1958, years before the first Apollo missions) and other subsequent spacecraft which went through the VA belts.</p>

<p>Afterwards in 1962 the US brilliantly decided to detonate a nuke inside the belts, which made predicting the radiation environment even more difficult.</p>

<p>But even after that a large number of spacecraft went through the VA belts and returned readings, namely Ranger 3 to 9, Surveyor 1 to 7 and Lunar Orbiter 1 to 5 all (I believe, at least most) had radiation detectors in board to assess the VA belts status.</p>

<p>Either way, once it was realised what the VA belts were and why they were there it became possible for scientists to attempt to predict the radiation environment theoretically.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what I mean when I talk about how NASA predicted the VA belt&#39;s shape and status. Of course, as they also knew, the VA belt can and does change shape, it also changes how ‘radioactive’ it is depending on what the Sun’s been pumping into it, which is why -even with the data from dozens of missions- nobody could say exactly what it would be like when Apollo went through. </p>

<p>As for why I said the radiation levels were lower than predicted, if you check this document on Apollo’s <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/tnD7080RadProtect.pdf">radiation protection</a> strategy then you&#39;ll see the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It has been proposed that neutron hazard be evaluated by the use of whole-body activation measurement of crewmen to determine the extent of neutron-induced sodium-24 and by use of neutron-resonant metal foils that have a known activation response for the type of neutrons expected. 
Both methods for neutron-dose assessment have been used at the NASA Manned Space-craft Center (MSC). Whole-body counting and neutron-resonant foil techniques had been initiated on the Apollo 11 mission. The results of these analyses indicated that neutron doses were significantly lower than had been anticipated. Activation products were below the limits of detection by whole-body spectroscopy, and activities were extremely low even in the neutron-resonant foils (ref. 7).</p>

<p>And the scientists happened to be 100% correct with their predictions all 6 times? </p>

</blockquote>

<p>So with 6 different mission to the moon, NASA just got lucky all 6 times and not one astronaut was harmed.  </p>

<p>Airbus has had more flight accidents (one) than Apollo despite Apollo going into unknown territory.  Then there&#39;s the Yuasa Lithium batteries that would catch on fire on board Boeing&#39;s Dreamliner but all the components in the Apollo pretty much worked to a T?</p>

<p>The Space Shuttle program had suffered 2 disastrous events during it&#39;s lifetime despite the fact that the Space Shuttle rarely left LEO.  One was a launch accident and one was a re-entry accident but Apollo had neither despite the fact that rocket tech was relatively new at the time and they had no re-entry accidents either, despite the fact that spacecraft tech was relativey new.</p>

<p>You know, even with your wealth of knowledge on the subject, do you not see how a person might be skeptical as the claims NASA makes as far as the success of the moon missions?  </p>

<p>Apollo pretty much worked to a T</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, it didn&#39;t, any research into the topic would prove you wrong instantly.</p>

<p>There were multiple deaths during the design, testing and development phases of Apollo. If you didn&#39;t notice, the moon landing was performed by Apollo 11. 11 isn&#39;t just a random number, it was called Apollo 11 because there were <strong>test missions before</strong>. You&#39;re acting as if NASA just sent Apollo off to the moon and got it right the first time magically with no preparation.</p>

<p>Apollo 1 had a fire which killed all three astronauts on board. So... yeah, three deaths isn&#39;t exactly &#39;working to a T&#39;.</p>

<p>Apollo 2 and 3 tested the launch vehicles and deployment.</p>

<p>Apollo 4 tested engine restart and re-entry.</p>

<p>Apollo 5 tested the lunar module&#39;s descent and ascent, as well as its abort functions.</p>

<p>Apollo 6 aimed to test everything in one go. A huge problem was found with vibrations causing the engines to shut down and fail.</p>

<p>Apollo 7 was the first manned orbit test. Went well-ish, apart from the crew fighting with mission control and there being high tension between them.</p>

<p>Apollo 8 left the Earth and went into Lunar orbit.</p>

<p>Apollo 9 went into LEO and tested the lunar lander as well as the new space suits.</p>

<p>Apollo 10 tested every single stage of the plan, including the lunar lander in  moon orbit. Apollo 10 descended to 15km above Lunar surface, just short of landing, and then returned. This was to test the descend and ascent engines in a Lunar-gravity environment.</p>

<p>Apollo 11 nearly aborted during the descent phase due to a <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.1201-fm.html">computer problem</a>.</p>

<p>Apollo 12 nearly aborted due to issues seen with the <a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-287/ch5.htm">battery and power supply</a>.</p>

<p>Apollo 13 famously had an oxygen tank explode, does &quot;Huston we have a problem&quot; right a bell?</p>

<p>Apollo 14 nearly aborted twice during descent, a (believed to be faulty) abort signal was being sent and was then ignored and the landing radar failed to get a lock and asked to abort as well, but was also ignored, and a manual landing as performed against guidance by NASA.</p>

<p>Apollo 15 went quite well. An engine failed to shut down properly and there was a risk that it might have damaged the spacecraft, but it didn&#39;t damage it as badly as expected.</p>

<p>Apollo 16 went quite well, most of the kinks had been worked out by now.</p>

<p>Apollo 17 went well.</p>

<p>So you&#39;re completely wrong and just making statements without any research.</p>

<p>As for the shuttle, it has two major accidents out of 135 missions. That&#39;s roughly one in seventy.</p>

<p>One in seventy chances for the shuttle to have an accident vs the 6 manned moon missions, most of which had problems anyway. I see no inconsistency here.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes, I see exactly why a person that has done absolutely no research and makes statements like &quot;not one astronaut was harmed&quot; and &quot;Apollo pretty much worked to a T&quot; would see this as a potential conspiracy. It would have been very unlikely to have everything go well throughout the entire Apollo program.</p>

<p>But it didn&#39;t. There&#39;s nothing suspicious at all about what happened.</p>

<p>NASA had far more knowledge of space and the effects of space during the space shuttle era vs. the apollo era.  Apollo was a totally new frontier and they didn&#39;t have any deaths in the sky?  The Russians have at least one confirmed death during the early years of their space missions.  And the Space Shuttle had two disasters in the sky despite the wealth of knowledge that they had.  </p>

<p>But Apollo, going almost 300,000 miles away from the Earth&#39;s surface didn&#39;t suffer one casualty?</p>

<p>I clearly gave you a list of all the problems that happened in the manned missions.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yep, that&#39;s exactly what happened.</p>

<p>You said it all went perfectly and I proved you wrong, so now you move the goalpost from &quot;Nothing went wrong! How&#39;s that possible?!&quot; to &quot;Nobody died! How&#39;s that possible?!&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s possible because hundreds of thousands of the smartest people on earth got together to work on one project.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see what evidence would convince you that it&#39;s entirely plausible for nobody to have died on the missions to the moon, so there&#39;s nothing more I can say.</p>

<p>Shockingly Apollo and the Space Shuttle happened at different times.</p>

<p>NASA peak employment during Apollo (1965): ~411,000 people</p>

<p>NASA peak employment during the Shuttle program (90&#39;s to now, although not as much data is available for employees now): ~20 to 25,000 people</p>

<p>And, again, this is all a game of statistics. It&#39;s not a question of &#39;if&#39; something will go wrong, it&#39;s &#39;when&#39;. And when you have over 100 shuttle missions something very unlikely is bound to slip past the millions of things systems engineers have to try and consider. And when you have under twenty missions planned, hopefully most of the things that can go wrong won&#39;t.</p>

<p>Also, the space shuttle is far more complex than the Apollo missions. Far more could have gone wrong with it, I&#39;m actually surprised there weren&#39;t more accidents with it since it was quite a shitty plan really.</p>

<p>But, again, tell me what evidence you need and I can try to find it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think <a href="/u/untumulted">/u/untumulted</a> didn&#39;t understand the difference between radiation shielding and material that just shields from radiation, while not being designed to be a radiation shield.</p>

<p>Admittedly, that wasn&#39;t as clear as it could have been, then again it&#39;s awkward to talk about radiation shielding shielding (like a lead radiation shield) and things which are shield against radiation (like paper, your skin, or really any material) but aren&#39;t actual radiation shielding, since that&#39;s not their purpose, it&#39;s just a thing they also do.</p>

<p>In the same way Apollo didn&#39;t have proper radiation shielding, but it was &#39;shielded&#39; against radiation just by virtue of it being a metallic capsule.</p>

<p>He thought I contradicted myself by saying Apollo essentially had no radiation shielding, but then I also talked about how Apollo did shield against radiation. It&#39;s not a contradiction as Apollo didn&#39;t have specially designed <strong>radiation shielding</strong>, but it <strong>did</strong> shield against radiation since it was made of metal and other materials which, by their nature, block radiation.</p>

<p>Any material really has some inherent amount of radiation it blocks. Just like everything has a mass/weight. We have weights designed as weights, designed to be lifted to get swole gainz, but a dice also has a weight, while not itself being a &#39;weight&#39;.</p>

<p>In the same way Apollo block&#39;s radiation since it&#39;s made of metal, so its hull shields against radiation, but it is not a radiation shield. </p>

<p>And the amount blocked by just the construction of Apollo was enough to deem it &#39;safe&#39; without additional shielding.</p>

<p>It was never claimed to be a moon rock by the US Ambassador who gave it as a gift, it was a misunderstanding as <em>&quot;My guess is that he did not hear well what was said,&quot; said the grandson. &quot;He may have formed his own idea about what it was.&quot;</em></p>

<p>This is verified by additional facts such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>the rock wasn&#39;t labelled as a moon rock on the plaque it was presented on</li>
<li>the rock was approximately 80 times larger than the other gifted rocks</li>
<li>the rock was given to the former Prime Minister years before actual moon rocks were being distributed</li>
</ul>

<p>It was a misunderstanding.  When you look at what the actual samples look like and how they are contained:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands_lunar_sample_displays#/media/File:Netherlands_Apollo_11_display.jpg">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands_lunar_sample_displays#/media/File:Netherlands_Apollo_11_display.jpg</a></p>

<p>compared to what was given to Drees:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/08/27/article-0-063396B8000005DC-918_468x409.jpg">http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/08/27/article-0-063396B8000005DC-918_468x409.jpg</a></p>

<p>How do you know it was presented as a moon rock?  If they did so, why wouldn&#39;t they make it look like any of the other gifted moon rocks?  Why would they give it to the person 3 years prior to any of the other gifted moon rocks?  Why would it be approximately 80x larger than any of the other gifted moon rocks if they were trying to &quot;pass it off&quot; as real?</p>

<p>Statespeople are given gifts all the time, why would that be odd?</p>

<p>Also, who is the one taking anything at anybody&#39;s word?  I&#39;ve provided photographs comparing the moon rocks and the gift rock demonstrating that they are in no way comparable in size, shape or presentation.  It is <em>you</em> who is trusting somebody (an 89 year old man no less) at their word that it was apparently possibly, even with all of this evidence to the contrary, presented as a moon rock.</p>

<p>Wasn&#39;t &quot;between governments&quot; and it wasn&#39;t &quot;masquerading&quot; as anything.  Again, I suggest you review the information a bit more closely, it seems as though you&#39;re deliberately not taking the time to educate yourself regarding the topic.</p>

<p>How would the museum know what the US Diplomat presented it as?  They&#39;re simply getting a third-hand account of what it was, making it even more likely that it was a misunderstanding.</p>

<p>Regardless, you&#39;re still choosing to believe that it was presented as a moon rock even though:</p>

<ul>
<li>there is no evidence for this fact</li>
<li>it appears completely different than gifted moon rocks</li>
<li>it was gifted three years prior to any moon rocks being distributed</li>
<li>it is approximately 80 times larger than any gifted moon rocks</li>
<li>it isn&#39;t encased in a globe like the gifted moon rocks</li>
</ul>

<p>Rather than it simply being a misunderstanding or misinterpretation.</p>

<p>The &quot;Dutch&quot; weren&#39;t given anything.  It was a private gift given to a former head of state.  The &quot;Dutch&quot; were given their moon rock later and it appeared much different:</p>

<p>What does &quot;confirmation as a diplomatic gift&quot; even mean?  It was a private gift given to somebody.</p>

<p>Do you think the US Government has people going to every museum on the planet fact-checking the items on display?</p>

<p>Again, do you have any idea how many gifts are exchanged on a daily basis between Ambassadors and other parties?  Do you think these are all tracked and documented?  If so, where is this documentation?  Do you have a list of all gifts exchanged in 1969?  Of course they &quot;can&#39;t explain it&quot;, it was a private gift given to somebody in 1969.  Unlike yourself, they aren&#39;t willing to jump to conclusions regarding what happened without any evidence.</p>

<p>How is petrified wood so hard to believe?  You understand that if this was an actual moon rock that according to auctions of other moon rocks it would be worth approximately $160 million going by weight?

<p>He wasn&#39;t the Head of State, he hadn&#39;t been in office for over 10 years.</p>

<p>I think that somebody was given a gift at 89 years old, didn&#39;t propertly hear what it was and drew their own conclusions.  This is supported by comments from his family as well as the fact that it looks nothing like any of the other moon rocks given as gifts.</p>

<p>The museum is primarily a classical art museum, why do you trust them to be able to determine whether or not something is a moon rock?  Furthermore, it wasn&#39;t &quot;finely crafted&quot;, it was a piece of petrified wood glued to a piece of cardboard and looked nothing like the moon rocks that were given as gifts.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Because nobody had ever seen a moon rock before and had no idea what one would look like?  You&#39;re somehow willing to accept that pens are given as gifts but not rocks?  You&#39;d think rock and mineral stores wouldn&#39;t exist if that were the case.</p>

<p>Where did you see that he was nearly deaf and blind anyway? I don&#39;t need a quote - his estate presented it to the museum as such. Is that too hard to follow?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Drees&#39;s grandson, also named Willem, told the AP his grandfather had been out of office for more than a decade and <strong>was nearly deaf and blind in 1969</strong>, though his mind was still sharp.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My guess is that he did not hear well what was said,&quot; said the grandson. <strong>&quot;He may have formed his own idea about what it was.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>So basically, if a nearly blind and deaf person tells you about an object, you&#39;re more likely to believe them than all of the evidence and personal anecdotes to the contrary? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh yeah? Is there somebody higher working the embassies around the world? Somebody higher than rank of ambassador living in foreign lands? Geez. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You said <strong>sole representative</strong>.  There are numerous representatives for any given country in a foreign country.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Amazing that the plaque doesn&#39;t state that the object is what you claim it was presented as.  This is where your argument falls apart.  If it was presented as a moon rock, then you&#39;d think that the plaque that came with it would state <strong>moon rock</strong> somewhere.  But it doesn&#39;t.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Because he was nearly deaf and blind and likely made the association himself?  I have no idea why they gave him a piece of petrified wood, probably the same reason I have a crappy set of ugly beer coasters.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Again, provide any evidence whatsoever and your position will start to make more sense.</p>

<p>Yay - you are being funny again. Apparently not that sharp according to you, because he somehow confused petrified wood with moon rock. Real fucking sharp.

<p>So your evidence is that somebody nearly blind who has never seen a moon rock in their lives <em>couldn&#39;t</em> possibly be confused when presented something at 82 while also being hard of hearing?  <strong>Again:</strong> please provide me any quote where Drees states that he was told he was being given a moon rock.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t say it was anything else anywhere else.  <strong>Again:</strong> why wouldn&#39;t the plaque state the object was a moon rock if it was being presented as such.</p>

<p>I never said that, his grandson was quoted as saying that.  You are having trouble keeping up with quotes from other people, I&#39;m not sure how to make them clearer for you beyond the use of quotation marks and links to the quotes, sorry.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know, maybe because they are fucking lying about it and covering their asses - so we can folks like you can say - well, we never technically said it was moon rock. Why would they use a fake rock like looking substance as commemoration for the moon landing?

That is as ELI5 as it gets. Lets see you wiggle your way out of this one. When you reply - make sure to quote me when I say: why didn&#39;t they disclose this rock like substance as petrified wood during the commemoration or alternatively, what were they trying to represent this rock like substance as? C&#39;mon, give it to me, this should be interesting. They didn&#39;t disclose it because they are lying sacks of shits who never went to the moon in the first place. </p>

<p>All conjecture.  The plaque doesn&#39;t state it was a moon rock, period.  If it were being presented as such, then you&#39;d think that the <strong>label</strong> for it would claim it was a moon rock.</p>

<p>How do you know what they said it was or wasn&#39;t during the commemoration?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>what were they trying to represent this rock like substance as?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have no idea, I wasn&#39;t there.  What&#39;s we do know is that the physical object wasn&#39;t labelled as a moon rock, it doesn&#39;t look like a moon rock, it is larger than any gifted moon rock, it has different packaging than any gifted moon rock and that it was presented prior to any moon rocks being distributed.</p>

<p>You are somehow taking these facts to demonstrate that it was being presented as a moon rock, even though nowhere does it state that it was.</p>

<p>You&#39;d think if this were the case that they&#39;d at least try and make it look like the other moon rocks, yet they failed to do so.  Not sure how you are able to account for this discrepancy.  If they wanted to pretend it was a moon rock, why didn&#39;t they make it look like <strong>any of the others</strong> that were gifted?</p>

<p>I never claimed to have one.  The fact of the matter is that it <strong>is</strong> petrified wood, and there is no evidence anywhere that it was claimed to be anything else.  Your conjecture isn&#39;t evidence.  In fact, the only piece of additional physical evidence (aside from the petrified wood itself) is the plaque, which again, doesn&#39;t state that it is a moon rock.</p>

<p>I&#39;m simply regurgitating what the evidence demonstrates.  You are the one making baseless assumptions that lack evidence.  Certainly you agree that a nearly blind and deaf person could be mistaken in thinking that they were being given a moon rock, but you have no evidence that demonstrates that <strong>anybody claimed that it was</strong>.  Again, it looks nothing like any of the other rocks, you seem to be ignoring this fact.</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t on public display for several decades.  In fact it wasn&#39;t even on display at the museum for the majority of the time it has been available.  You seem to be confused regarding the sequence of events.</p>

<p>Well, it was fun while it lasted. But you still can&#39;t provide anything close to a reasonable rationale as to why they commemorated what is apparently the greatest achievement of mankind with fake rock. And it looks like I&#39;ll never get it out of you. You just keep saying that I&#39;m not reading my information right. I guess, I&#39;ll never know why the diplomat community uses shit rocks as commemoration plaques, specifically when rocks have nothing to do with what we are commemorating.

<p>Once you get past don&#39;t-go-boom-boom rocket science can be remarkably simple. Sure, it is stupidly inefficient and insanely dangerous if you just stick to the simple things, and something like Apollo would never be allowed today (yeah m8 just go through that belt of radiation really fast, you&#39;ll... er... probably be fine), but I have no doubt that with the relatively terrible standards of the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s Apollo was possible.</p>

<p>Well, that&#39;s wrong, since <a href="http://www.physics.ucsd.edu/%7Etmurphy/apollo/doc/Bender.pdf">the Russians themselves</a> (as well as others) made readings from the LLRE/other reflectors on the Moon, and data from the 60&#39;s onwards is <a href="http://polac.obspm.fr/llrdatae.html">available from multiple countries</a>, as well as a literal <a href="http://www.honeysucklecreek.net/other_stations/bochum/index.html">metric fucktonne</a> of other <a href="http://www.astr.ua.edu/keel/space/apollo.html">independent observers</a> confirming that they <a href="http://www.astr.ua.edu/keel/space/apollo.html">received data</a> that <a href="http://www.svengrahn.pp.se/trackind/Apollo17/Apollo17log.pdf">must have come from the Moon</a>, or at least <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IgsAAAAAMBAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA33&amp;amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false">observing the Apollo spacecraft</a>.</p>

<p>I will refer you to the 1966 issue of National Geographic, wherein they bounced a laser off the moon before the alleged lunar landings and alleged lunar ranging equipment. Therefore, there is no need for tiny reflectors on the moon to bounce a laser off it, invalidating the need for the lunar ranging experiment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually the <a href="http://www.physics.ucsd.edu/%7Etmurphy/apollo/doc/Bender.pdf">first lunar ranging experiments were done in 1962</a>, well before the 1966 study you were thinking of.</p>

<p>That was done with Q-switched ruby lasers (extremely high power, extremely short pulses of light). However these readings had a large amount of error and variance, due to the reflection just bouncing off of the surface of the moon in all directions.</p>

<p>Subsequent measurements had far lower error. This is especially true after Apollo 15 specifically as Apollo 15 brought with it much larger reflector arrays than ever before, gave much more accurate readings, which fit in perfectly with the theoretical error (namely the 0.11m RMS residual error) expected by the equipment NASA said had been sent to the Moon.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to achieve such high accuracy, low error results without the reflectors left behind on the moon.</p>

<p>People have said in the past &quot;But a probe/rover could have just put them there!&quot; and, yes, a rover could have done nearly the exact same thing, and reflectors have just been left on the moon by probes in the past.</p>

<p>Which is why I also gave numerous independent sources which tracked the Apollo spacecraft to the moon, proving that it was -in fact- the Apollo missions which left the reflectors behind, and not another spacecraft.</p>

<p>Have there been current experiments conducted wherein lasers were shot at areas of the moon without the lunar reflectors? How much of these results have been improved by more sensitive equipment, better lasers, etc?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve read that a laser pulse will grow wider over a distance. How large will a laser get over 250,000 miles? (If what I&#39;ve read is correct).</p>

<p>I will agree that you have a good argument, and we can put that in the &quot;they went to the moon&quot; pile. However, due to the large amount of scientific anomalies, I still find that there&#39;s insufficient evidence to show that we went.</p>

<p>Not that I&#39;m aware of, the data from just doing that is... okay, but not really worth the time if you can use the reflectors for more accurate readings.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By how much have the lunar reflectors been disturbed by moonquakes? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If they have been it&#39;s not enough to be noticed, this links in with what I&#39;m saying next.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Using <a href="http://www.physics.ucsd.edu/%7Etmurphy/apollo/doc/Bender.pdf">the document linked before</a>, they say the laser divergence is about two arc seconds, you can roughly approximate this as a triangle with an angle of two arc seconds, a side 384,400km long (average distance to the moon) and you&#39;ll get the side opposite the angle as how wide the beam is at the moon.</p>

<p>Awkwardly I don&#39;t know what the convention was in the 60/70&#39;s, so 2 arc sec&#39;s is either the actual beam divergence of half of it...</p>

<p>That gives a beam width of roughly 4km, but there are a lot of other sources of error and atmospheric effects to consider, so the actual beam will likely be larger. Using your value of 250,000 miles this&#39;d give a width of about 2.4 miles (3.9km).</p>

<p>So I&#39;d say the beam width is, to one significant figure, either 4km or (if they gave the half-angle) 8km.</p>

<p><a href="http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEhelp/ApolloLaser.html">NASA cites</a> the beam width ass roughly four miles, which is about 6.4km. Eh, falls within what I&#39;d expect.</p>

<p>Any potential shifting by moonquakes is unlikely to have moved any of the reflectors that much. And, since they&#39;re retroreflectors, even a change in the angle they&#39;re pointing (so it&#39;s not directly towards the earth) shouldn&#39;t affect them too much.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>large amount of scientific anomalies</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure, there might be some anomalies, but that&#39;s science. What matters is finding your sources of error and figuring out what went wrong. In my first year at university I remember getting readings for, say, the speed of light using a Michelson–Morley interferometer (far more boring than it sounds) and being about fifty times off the speed of light. Turns out I fucked up my calibration, explained that, explained how to correct for it theoretically (key point here, you can&#39;t just say &quot;I was twice what I thought so I halved it to get the right answer because... that gave the right answer!&quot; you need to find theoretical justifications first), did it, and then I was only about 20% off the actual speed of light.</p>

<p>People see &#39;wrong&#39; answers or &#39;anomalies&#39; in science and instantly assume it&#39;s wrong or some kind of conspiracy, since they stop at the numbers and don&#39;t bother reading the rest of a 50 page long article or paper on the science which then explains sources of error, what went wrong, corrections, etc...</p>

<p>Edit: As a side note, turns out that the US laser ranging experiments were discontinued since it costs quite a lot of money to get a laser that accurate and powerful firing at the moon a lot. Other countries/universities/independent researchers might still be using the reflectors though.</p>

<p>Like what? I&#39;m decent(ish) at most aspects of physics, along with engineering related to astronautics and most spacecraft systems, I know some topics better than others but after a bit of research I should be able to answer most questions, unless it&#39;s something very specific and obscure.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>None really. Just the distance can be used for a lot of things, you can verify various things like Einstein&#39;s relativity, Newton&#39;s laws of gravitation, orbital motion and a few other things like seeing how fast the moon is moving away from the earth, if it&#39;s accelerating away, decelerating, whatever. Depending on how accurate the distance data was you could even try &#39;detecting&#39; other planets with the moon&#39;s motion.</p>

<p>But all of that could have been done with a (relative) handful of readings, there was no real point in keeping it going after the first few years once enough data was collected. Well, I imagine you could extract some information like... the movement of dust on the moon by looking at the trend in reflected intensity off the reflectors, since a steady downward trend in reflection could let you extrapolate how dust much dust has built up on them over time. Then again the performance of the mirrors would degrade over time as well,, which complicates things. Yeah, this is why you can find 100 page long papers on &#39;simple&#39; sounding things, there&#39;s a lot to take into account.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#39;m surprised the US paid for it for so long considering how useless taking more data points became after the first few years.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot of problems with the radiation, I find.</p>

<p>In particular, after the missions, the dosimeters of the astronauts were said to be within expected limits. <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/tnD7080RadProtect.pdf">Link</a></p>

<p>However, years later it was found that the moon gives off more radiation than expected.
<a href="http://news.discovery.com/space/history-of-space/moon-radiation-gamma-rays.htm">Link</a> In particular, the link provided states &quot;Overall, future lunar travelers face a radiation dose 30 percent to 40 percent higher than originally expected&quot; </p>

<p>Why didn&#39;t the original dosimeter readings reflect this greater than expected radiation?</p>

<p>Moreover, why do none of the pictures suffer from any sort of radiation damage? Outside the magnetosphere, one would expect a photographic plate to pickup stray cosmic rays, in addition to other ionizing radiation.</p>

<p>Further, the spacesuits weren&#39;t made of any particularly dense material. <a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/neil-armstrongs-spacesuit-was-made-by-a-bra-manufacturer-3652414/">Link</a> Why was this deemed to be sufficient protection for the surface of the moon? <a href="https://www.asme.org/wwwasmeorg/media/ResourceFiles/AboutASME/Who%20We%20Are/Engineering%20History/Landmarks/ApolloBR.pdf">Another link</a> It appears to me this fabric is insufficient to protect against ionizing radiation.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Why didn&#39;t the original dosimeter readings reflect this greater than expected radiation?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t believe NASA put much effort into predicting the radiation dose from the surface of the moon in the first place, since it wasn&#39;t thought to be a major source of radiation, and only major sources (like the VA belt, solar particles, cosmic rays and high energy neutrons) were taken into account, so there isn&#39;t a prediction for lunar-surface-based radiation exposure to compare against, only the predictions of additional radiation caused by being outside the protective spacecraft.</p>

<p>And keep in mind that the radiation doses <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/tnD7080RadProtect.pdf">noted here</a> are averaged out over the entire mission, Apollo 11, for example, took about eight days, with only a few hours of that spent on the surface of the moon. So even if the expected radiation dose was, say, doubled (even though at most it&#39;s only 40% more) over four or so hours out of nearly 200 hours of mission time, the average dose wouldn&#39;t increase by a perceptible amount.</p>

<p>Actually the averages did vary between individuals as well:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Individual dosimeter</strong> readings have varied approximately <strong>20 percent from the average</strong> because of variations in the shielding effectiveness of the Apollo spacecraft and the <strong>differences in duties</strong>, movements, and locations of the crewmen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A 20% difference over the entire mission average would more than account for a few hours of heightened radiation from being on the surface of the moon, vs. the astronauts that never stepped onto the surface. There&#39;s no inconsistency with the dosimeter readings since the time spent on the surface was far too small to notice that the moon was radioactive. A 40% increase on estimates that must have been, by NASA not even including them in their analysis, minuscule, is not that much of an increase.</p>

<p>Additionally as the article says:</p>

<p>&quot;We are in a period when the radiation risks are elevated, but still tolerable,&quot; Spence said, adding that the levels were about what an X-ray technician or uranium miner might normally experience in a year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The increase is tiny. And the author on Discovery seemed to know that, since under half of the article is actually on it and the rest is on generic GCR&#39;s.</p>

<p>As for why the increase is small, I&#39;ll try and explain the science behind it.</p>

<p>I tried to find the actual scientific paper this <a href="http://news.discovery.com/space/history-of-space/moon-radiation-gamma-rays.htm">used</a>, but I couldn&#39;t, so there&#39;s not much to go off of.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell they&#39;re talking about parts of the surface of the moon becoming radioactive because of high-energy galactic cosmic rays, which does happen. However GCR&#39;s have a huge distribution of energy from a few eV to 40TeV (IIRC, did some radiation hardening projects a while ago and that&#39;s the upper bound I found), so it&#39;s hard to predict what will happen.</p>

<p>Now, GCR&#39;s can either just decay on their own and randomly release a shower of various particles, or they can interact with whatever they hit. Now depending on the kind of interaction and what was interacted with various kinds of secondary particles will be created and will &#39;shower&#39; out in the original direction of travel. Meaning that any particles which interact with the surface of the moon (so, they were very likely travelling towards the moon) would shower &#39;downwards&#39;, into the moon&#39;s surface.</p>

<p>When the article talks about higher than expected radiation levels on the moon, it is (as far as I can tell) talking about additional radiation caused by the secondary particles created when GCR&#39;s interact with the moon&#39;s surface.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t remember if I explained this to you or somebody else, but there are <a href="http://www.remnet.jp/english/lecture/b03_01/images/seishitu.gif">four main kinds of radiation</a>, all of which could (with varying degrees of likelihood depending on the GCR&#39;s energy) be produced by a GCR interaction.</p>

<p>Any additional gamma rays (or high energy neutron&#39;s, although I doubt they&#39;d occur that often, if ever) will be travelling into the moon, so they pose no extra risk. And, even if they were going towards the astronauts, the likelihood is that they would just pass straight through them (and the sensors) and have no effect.</p>

<p>Alpha&#39;s would be blocked by the suit.</p>

<p>Beta&#39;s are the only one that might contribute more to the radiation dose of the astronauts since they&#39;re mildly penetrating and have a &#39;decent&#39; chance of interacting with them, but the majority of them would be directed towards the moon anyway, so it wouldn&#39;t make too much of a difference.</p>

<p>Back to the tiny chance of neutron&#39;s interacting with materials on the moon. It is possible for neutrons to interact with atoms and &#39;stick&#39; to them, creating a new unstable isotope which becomes radioactive. These would be quite concerning as they could then emit radiation in any direction, even towards the astronauts. But, again, this exposure to radiation is tiny, as is said in the article, that even taking into account the extra radiation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We are in a period when the radiation risks are elevated, but still tolerable,&quot; Spence said, adding that the levels were about what an <strong>X-ray technician or uranium miner might normally experience in a year</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only true radiation concern was solar events. I&#39;d happily go anywhere in space as long as I knew there were no solar flares or CME&#39;s about to happen. Normal background galactic radiation is... not good for you, but it won&#39;t kill you too quickly, unlike a solar event which -if it&#39;s powerful enough and aimed towards you- is just a straight-up death sentence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>none of the pictures suffer from any sort of radiation damage?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Radiation damage would only look like a bit of static/fuzziness/tiny white dots. You&#39;ll definitely see them on film, but the quality of video is so low that you can&#39;t distinguish the static-from-shitty-video from static-from-GCR. As for photos, the chance of taking a photo and having the shutter open at the exact moment when a weakly-interacting GCR does interact is tiny and any interactions would, again, only produce small white dots at most.</p>

<p>Looking at modern high-res pictures form the ISS you still can&#39;t really see the effects of radiation, but it&#39;s quite in some videos since they look a bit static-ish with random white dots everywhere.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It appears to me this fabric is insufficient to protect against ionizing radiation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, from the article you linked:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The next seven layers consisted of alternating piles of [...] that worked together to shield the astronauts against galactic radiation on the lunar surface.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only real concern was alpha radiation, which is blocked by paper, and beta radiation, which can be blocked relatively easily by a thin layer of metal. As for gamma and neutron radiation, you just sort of hope it&#39;ll go through you, since there&#39;s no real way to block it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How would you do that, exactly? Wouldn&#39;t you need a clock?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are a few predicted effects from relativity that can be tested just with light. I believe gravitational droppler shifting (<del>so, instead of an ambulance going past sounding different because it&#39;s moving towards/away from you, it&#39;d sound different because... er... if you&#39;re above it the gravity would &#39;pull&#39; on the sound waves and slow them down</del> actually I doubt that even happens and the mechanics for relativistic shifts are completely different...) was one of the things they tested.</p>

<p>Basically, shine your laser at the moon and when it reflects back relativity predicts it&#39;ll have a slightly different colour.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your answer. Your responses seem quite reasonable. </p>

<p>Couple questions: When you list your 4 types of radiation particles, where do X-rays fit in? As I understand, it&#39;s ionizing radiation which is the real danger. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Radiation damage would only look like a bit of static/fuzziness/tiny white dots.</p>

<p>Would we not see little blips indicating fast moving particles?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Looking at modern high-res pictures form the ISS you still can&#39;t really see the effects of radiation</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The ISS is inside the magnetosphere though. As I understand it, the magnetosphere protects against X-rays, gamma rays and cosmic rays. I would imagine there would be evidence of these on the photos.</p>

<p>This guy <a href="http://ocii.com/%7Edpwozney/apollo5.htm">link</a> seems to think the average amount of radiation received was vastly above safe levels. </p>

<p>Ultimately, I think the &quot;didn&#39;t go&quot; radiation arguments are that there&#39;s too much radiation. And the &quot;did go&quot; radiation arguments are that there&#39;s not enough radiation to do enough damage. I&#39;m not a physicist, so both arguments have validity in my mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>where do X-rays fit in</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anything ranging from invisible radio waves to visible light and X-rays to gamma rays falls under electromagnetic radiation.</p>

<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/EM_Spectrum_Properties_edit.svg/2000px-EM_Spectrum_Properties_edit.svg.png">Here&#39;s a little graph... thingy of the EM spectrum.</a></p>

<p>Shorter wavelength means higher energy. As an easy example, when light hits an object it gets absorbed, excites the electrons of an atom so they go up in an energy level and when the electron goes back down it re-emits the light.</p>

<p>For higher-energy EM radiation, like X-ray and gamma, the electron goes to such a high energy level that it pops off the atom.</p>

<p>This means that the atom now has a charge, making it an ion, which is why high-energy EM radiation is called ionizing radiation.</p>

<p>Luckily for us high energy EM radiation doesn&#39;t really interact too often, it just passes through most things without hitting an atom and making the electron come off, and as the likelihood of an interaction is low it&#39;s only really a concern when you have a high number flux (amount/number of) of ionizing EM radiation, since if you have millions of gamma rays going through you some are bound to do some damage.</p>

<p>Which is why the main concern for Apollo was a solar event causing a huge increase in ionizing radiation flux, as then the chance of serious damage being done is hugely increased.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Would we not see little blips indicating fast moving particles?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You only really see the blips if a particle has interacted with your film, and (for the same reasons I explained before) usually the chance of this interaction happening in the tiny time the film is exposed is very low, so low that even if an interaction did happen you would only see -at best- a single white dot, which would be hard to notice anyway.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The ISS is inside the magnetosphere though. As I understand it, the magnetosphere protects against X-rays, gamma rays and cosmic rays. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The magnetosphere can only protect against charged particle radiation affected by a magnetic field, so beta and alpha radiation would be deflected by the magnetosphere as alpha radiation is (and this a bit of a generalisation) composed of two protons and two neutrons, giving it a positive charge. Whereas beta radiation is essentially just a high energy electron, which also has a charge.</p>

<p>These particles then get deflected in a few different ways, some just go straight past the magnetosphere, some get caught in the VA belts, some go on to make the Aurora Borealis, and some just go through the field anyway.</p>

<p>X-rays and gamma rays are both electromagnetic radiation, they&#39;re just a kind of light, so the Earth&#39;s magnetic field has no real effect on them and they go straight through. I haven&#39;t studied this much but the Earth&#39;s atmosphere protects us from at least some (if not most? Seriously have no idea how important this is to us not all dying) of this radiation as the X-rays/gamma rays tend to interact with the atmosphere, so very few of them get far enough to interact with us.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This guy link[1] seems to think the average amount of radiation received was vastly above safe levels.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He makes quite a few points that NASA though of already, and that I (think) I&#39;ve covered.</p>

<p>He quotes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The fluxes of energetic particles can increase hundreds of times, following an intense solar flare or during a large geomagnetic storm, to dangerous levels. Timely warnings are essential to give astronauts sufficient time to return to their spacecraft prior to the arrival of such energetic particles.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And asks how they were protected against the flares.</p>

<p>They weren&#39;t, which is why the 60&#39;s Apollo practices are seen as very unsafe today.</p>

<p>Not sure if I mentioned this to you, but Apollo&#39;s main way of protecting against solar flares was planning. They observed the sun using multiple Earth and space based systems and timed missions to when they thought the sun wouldn&#39;t be too active. Additionally if a solar flare or CME or whatever did happen, they had roughly eight hours before the main brunt of particle radiation made it to Earth, so there was some time to get the astronauts back and cancel the mission... as long as they could get back in eight hours that is.</p>

<p>The rest of his points mostly just restate this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why would NASA subject people to this kind of risk?</p>

<p>Once you are past the Van Allen shields, for example between the earth and the moon, or on the moon, you would be subject to the full brunt of solar flares. The Van Allen shields protect us here on Earth from this deadly radiation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yep. It was not the safest plan, but NASA was confident they could predict solar activity well enough for it to be safe-ish.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>stimates of human exposure in interplanetary space, behind various thicknesses of aluminum shielding, are made for the large solar proton events of August 1972 and October 1989. A comparison of risk assessment in terms of total absorbed dose for each event is made for the skin, ocular lens, and bone marrow. Overall, the doses associated with the August 1972 event were higher than those with the October 1989 event and appear to be more limiting when compared with current guidelines for dose limits for missions in low Earth orbit and more hazardous with regard to potential acute effects on these organs. Both events could be life-threatening if adequate shielding is not provided</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Completely right, but no such events occurred and NASA&#39;s predictions were right.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The hulls of the Apollo spacecraft were ultra-thin. They would have been unable to stop any significant amount of radiation. The same can be said for the spacesuits.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yep, not the safest plan.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Spacecast 2020 Technical Report puts the space weather radiation hazard to human life in perspective:
&quot;...at geostationary orbit, with only 0.1 gm/cm2 of aluminum shielding thickness, the predicted radiation dose (REM) for one year continuous exposure, with minimum-moderate solar activity, is estimated to be about 3,000,000...&quot;</p>

<p>At geosynchronous orbit, doses are &quot;still low compared to interplanetary space due to geomagnetic shielding&quot;, according to Radiation Hardening In Space.</p>

<p>A radiation dose value from a low energy flare is provided from NASA Mooned America, p. 134: &quot;On page 256 of &#39;Astronautical Engineering&#39; there is a chart that shows the dosage of four different flares. On August 22, 1958 there was a low energy flare that could have been reduced to 25-rem with 2-cm of water shielding.&quot;</p>

<p>So, being conservative and using 25 rems per flare, we have 25 rems x 15 flares/day = 375 rems / day for the Apollo astronauts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not sure how accurate those figures are, and I&#39;m leaving in a bit so I don&#39;t have time to check, but solar activity varies heavily and is not omni-directional. Solar flares and CME&#39;s occur in a particular direction, so even with 15 flares a day it&#39;s highly unlikely that any of them will be directed towards Earth because of how incredibly huge the sun and solar system are.</p>

<p>Additionally NASA also <a href="http://i.imgur.com/om2wNlU.png">provided a graph showing the (additional?) dose astronauts would have received if the missions were badly timed</a> and ended  up running in months/days of high solar activity (given in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/tnD7080RadProtect.pdf">radiation document</a> you&#39;ve already seen)..</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, I think the &quot;didn&#39;t go&quot; radiation arguments are that there&#39;s too much radiation. And the &quot;did go&quot; radiation arguments are that there&#39;s not enough radiation to do enough damage. I&#39;m not a physicist, so both arguments have validity in my mind.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s fair enough. The topic is quite complicated, to the point where radiation hardening is a specific job position and a single person would work in that role for their entire life.</p>

<p>Mostly the problem of people not understanding how dangerous radiation is has been caused by the media. In movies, TV-shows, books, games, on the news, everywhere, it&#39;s cool to portray radiation as this thing that instantly kills you and makes you into a mutant, when it&#39;s really not.</p>

<p>As a quick example your smoke detector probably uses some kind of radioactive source like Americium-241, but since it&#39;s an alpha source it gets blocked by basically anything and is perfectly safe. Wouldn&#39;t surprise me if there&#39;s some article somewhere from around the time they were made mandatory about how the government wants to force everybody to put multiple sources of deadly radiation inside their homes and how it&#39;ll give all our children cancer or something like that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, and lastly for this bit:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For occupational exposure dose limits, the International Atomic Energy Agency states that the &quot;occupational exposure of any worker shall be so controlled&quot; that the limit of an &quot;effective dose of 50 mSv&quot; &quot;in any single year&quot; &quot;be not exceeded&quot;. 50 mSv converts to 5 rems.</p>

<p>How were the Apollo astronauts able to withstand 375 rems per day when the IAEA occupational exposure dose limit is only 5 rems in any single year?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the same NASA radiation document it&#39;ll say somewhere that the maximum allowed dose was 400rems. I would accept a dose of 400rems, sure it won&#39;t be healthy but it (probably) won&#39;t kill you. Hell, even 1,000rems shouldn&#39;t be deadly. 5,000rems kills you in a month.</p>

<p>IAEA has such strict regulations as, unlike for astronauts, they expect continuous radiation exposure over multiple years. radiologyinfo has the estimate that  &quot;Accumulated dosage estimated to cause a fatal cancer many years later in 5% of people: 1,000.00mSv&quot;, 1,000mSv is 100rads. When you have thousands of employees working in the same radiation environment for 10, 20 years even a small dose builds up, and 5% of thousands is still a good few dozen or hundred, so regulations are very strict in such environments because of how many people are exposed and for the length of time.</p>

<p>If the chance of astronauts getting cancer due to their exposure was 5% (which it wasn&#39;t) then... well... there&#39;s like four of them, 1/20 get cancer, eh, 4 is less than 20, meh, should be fine (60/70&#39;s logic isn&#39;t really up to today&#39;s standards).</p>

<p>It&#39;s in the nature of engineers, scientists and those that set health and safety laws to half or double most things for redundancy. Building collapses under 40 tonnes of load? Build it for 80 tonnes. Plane wings expect max 2m of flex in strong winds? Build it for 4m of flex. 1,000rems start causing adverse effects to health? Limit it to 500rems. </p>

From flying over Canada last January I saw the curvature of the earth.

    <div class="md"><p>Ask any scientist, you cannot see the curvature from that low of an altitude. 
If you work out the math (I have) at 120,000 ft you would only be able to see 1% of the curvature of the earth. 
From a plane any curvature would be impossible to detect with the naked eye. 
In any case, that Flat Earth stuff is a big part of Dubay and his books, the NASA / moon hoax stuff just fits into that. </p>

Flat or globe you wouldn&#39;t be able to see the curvature. If you think you have, you&#39;re wrong, it isn&#39;t possible. Don&#39;t blame me, that&#39;s reality for you. 
Your snide attitude and inability to grasp basic facts about geometry hurts us and makes us look more stupid than anything.

    <div class="md"><p>There is 2 pieces of evidence that trouble me. The First one is the fake Earth shot from &quot;something funny happened on the way to the moon&quot; where they shut down all the lights inside and use a transparency in the window to make it seem they were filming the earth from further than they really were. However, there was an excellent rebuke of that one. Someone took a screen grab of the earth as seen from an unrelated sequence where Armstrong was in the foreground and we see the earth through a window and matched it to a weather satellite image from the same day and it match.
The 2nd one I find more problematic. On Apollo 16 there is this shot of them going up a hill in the rover. The problem is that in the background you see the same landscape as in a previous Apollo mission. But they are suppose to be miles away from that location. </p>

<p>Less evident is the color shot brought back from the Jade Rabbit rover, the color are drastically different than what we saw from the Apollo mission. </p>

<p>None of it is fully dismissive of the possibility of having actually been there. But I find those really problematic.</p>

<p>It is on you to do the reading and further research if you really want to know.  You can easily find someone to comfort you with words like &quot;don&#39;t worry, of course the moon landings were real, anyone who says otherwise is (insert derisive insult here).&quot;  </p>

<p>It is possible that you should start with another topic before this one though.  It is important to realize that mainstream consensus does not equal truth.  This is easy to demonstrate with an example.  At one point lead paint was considered safe.  Exposure to it caused behavioral problems in children that were blamed on parents.  But people were called crazy if they questioned the safety of lead paint.  Learning about the history of the use of techniques used to manufacture consensus allows you to escape the trap that mainstream consensus = truth.  Bernays is a good place to start for this:  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bernays">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bernays</a>  One of his important publications &#39;Propaganda&#39; (1928) <a href="http://whale.to/b/bernays.pdf">http://whale.to/b/bernays.pdf</a></p>

<p>Hey OP, the reason they call it a cover up is because they obscure the evidence and they don&#39;t want any evidence around.</p>

<p>If anyone outside of NASA and the govt had solid evidence that it was faked, then we all would know about it and the moon landing would be a non issue.</p>

<p>But as time goes on, we start to learn the truth.</p>

<p>But the moon landings is like the JFK assasination.  We&#39;re never ever going to know if they were true conspiracies, although there&#39;s a lot of evidence that points that way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s analyse that. Your statement would be true under the assumption that an astronaut weighs approximately the same they do on Earth. (and that people on Earth can jump a foot in the air without meaningfully bending their legs, which seems... unusual.) 100kg on Earth would be something like 1/6th so about 16kg on the Moon, which leads to making bigger jumps with the same level of effort. </p>

<p>However, for that to be true we have to assume that astronauts are A) the same mass as they are on Earth, or close enough - and B) that they are delivering the same amount of force to their jump. </p>

<p>A) is easy-ish to check. We&#39;ll assume that astronauts weigh, on average about 80 kg - a healthy amount for a fit man. I don&#39;t know the exact amounts, and they&#39;d sooner edge towards lighter than heavier, for obvious reasons. I looked up the weight of the suit and found it&#39;s generally listed as 200 pounds, or 91 kg, for an EVA suit on Apollo 11 (presumably pre-inflation.) The suit is already heavier than the entire person it&#39;s supporting, then. </p>

<p>B) The suit is resistant to deformation when inflated, which is why most of the movements in it are ungainly and imprecise, something easily detected in a lot of footage featuring it. The movement method used on the moon, as per the astronauts own statements, was also more along the line of skipping than trying to jump really high - there&#39;s a few clips where that does happen, and they reach considerably higher there than in this clip. </p>

<p>These seem like relevant points to take into account for any calculations.</p>

<p>Anyway, since there&#39;s more obvious measuring points in other videos - particularly objects like sand which can&#39;t be affected by any system or pulleys or whatnot - and the low g is consistent <em>there</em>, it seems unlikely even in the moonhoax scenario that any fakery would have just flubbed the most obvious stuff. Either NASA is super-competent or incompetent - you can&#39;t have both.</p>

<p>I mean, I can change the variables too and make it fit, but I&#39;m not sure how that&#39;s supposed to be favorable for the &#39;fake&#39; scenario. If they were using lighter suits and whatnot, why would they not incorporate the 6 feet hops you imagine should be there?</p>

<p>Extaordinary claims require extraordinary proof.  What is it that has you so convinced?  Hopefully not that pre-recorded, over dubbed, filmed off a nasa screen that  America
 was shown.  As a data scientist quite interested in physics, I can assure you if you follow the flight path and speeds of the missions (among hundreds of other ridiculous details), just this in itself is enough to totally see the moon missions for what they really are:  US government funded propaganda at it&#39;s finest.</p>

<p>10 years ago, I was a loner in my circle of friends and family, called out as being crazy for having such delusional ideas.  Slowly but surely, over time I have had dozens of people come to me saying over time they had switched sides.  Sorry it&#39;s taking you a long time.</p>

<p>Maybe, go read the whole &#39;wagging the moon doggie&#39; series, and just pit your good old common sense against the facts presented in those articles. </p>

<p>Hey. You still have a right to believe in whatever you want, just like I respect my grandkid&#39;s Santa Clause. </p>

<p>As far as I am concerned, both tales are kept alive and handed down,  relying on the natural gullibility of humans to survive.</p>

<p>Maybe in another 50-75 years when we have not gone back, people will start asking questions and better understand they have been played.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it&#39;s good that that&#39;s exactly what I did a few years ago.</p>

<p>One of my assignments was to check the flight path of any spacecraft. I looked around a bit and found independent raw readings of Doppler shift from Apollo 17 (I think it was 17 anyway).</p>

<p>Then using the shift I found the velocity, acceleration, height, etc... </p>

<p>And it fit perfectly, within error, to what was expected. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s where I got my data from:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.svengrahn.pp.se/trackind/Apollo17/APOLLO17.htm">www.svengrahn.pp.se/trackind/Apollo17/APOLLO17.htm</a> </p>

<p>They performed almost exactly the same analysis I did.</p>

<p>If you check... one of my other posts, I give even more independent sources from various countries, universities and even some random guy with a powerful radio.</p>

<p>Of course, when I gave independent sources somebody replied saying that all the super powers (including the Russians and US) are actually working together and that each of those sources was a member of the conspiracy... yeah. </p>

<p>So, what would convince you that the landings did happen? Since I get the feeling nothing could convince you, and if that is the case then we&#39;re both wasting our time. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why you think it&#39;s up anyone to prove that NASA didn&#39;t go to the moon; it&#39;s up to NASA to prove they went.</p>

<p>You know, not go through long drawn out examples of how it&#39;s different now, but just show the shielding used and how it worked. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t have that though. So you can&#39;t. Instead, you have to string together a bunch of nonsense.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not your fault. NASA didn&#39;t give you the tools to prove they went to the moon, because they can&#39;t give them to you. There&#39;s no solid evidence that NASA went. All &quot;evidence&quot; suggesting they did is utterly corrupted.</p>

<p>But it amazes me when some one who is dealing in their &quot;area of expertise&quot; wouldn&#39;t just go straight to the money shot: they used this! Boom! Eat it! And it doesn&#39;t concern you that you can&#39;t.</p>

<p>Like can be done with any other provable thing. </p>

<p>Well, I can.</p>

<p>Here are the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/tnD7080RadProtect.pdf">publicly available documents from NASA on protection against radiation for the Apollo mission</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/lunar/documents/NTRS/collection3/NASA_CR_106949.pdf">
Here&#39;s another publicly available document</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.braeunig.us/space/69-19.htm">And another</a>.</p>

<p>Essentially, with what was available to them then, no amount of shielding could have helped (in fact trying to shield would be harmful), so the next best option was to go through the belts as fast as possible, at a time with low solar activity and decent space weather predictions, and hope nothing broke and that none of the astronauts got cancer and died later on.</p>

<p>Why wouldn&#39;t shielding help? I&#39;ll be as brief as possible.</p>

<p>There are <a href="http://www.remnet.jp/english/lecture/b03_01/images/seishitu.gif">four main kinds of radiation</a>.</p>

<p>Alpha fucks shit up, but gets stopped by almost anything, so the spacecraft&#39;s exterior was enough.</p>

<p>Beta fucks shit up less badly, but would still be stopped by the exterior (mostly).</p>

<p>Gamma usually just goes through everything, but if it interacts then it fucks everything up since it releases different kinds of radiation <em>inside of you/the components</em>. Stopping it would need too much shielding, so the best option is to reduce what it can interact with and hope it just goes through everything.</p>

<p>Same-ish for neutron.</p>

<p>NASA probes showed that there was far less radiation in the VA belt than expected, and that if they went through fast enough then shielding wouldn&#39;t be needed.</p>

<p>It was an insanely stupid risk by today&#39;s standards, which is why Orion is doing it properly this time. Although it&#39;ll still go through as fast as possible to reduce exposure.</p>

<p>Boom. Eat it.</p>

<p>It was never claimed to be a moon rock by the US Ambassador who gave it as a gift, it was a misunderstanding as <em>&quot;My guess is that he did not hear well what was said,&quot; said the grandson. &quot;He may have formed his own idea about what it was.&quot;</em></p>

<p>This is verified by additional facts such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>the rock wasn&#39;t labelled as a moon rock on the plaque it was presented on</li>
<li>the rock was approximately 80 times larger than the other gifted rocks</li>
<li>the rock was given to the former Prime Minister years before actual moon rocks were being distributed</li>
</ul>

<p>It was a misunderstanding.  When you look at what the actual samples look like and how they are contained:</p>

<p>compared to what was given to Drees:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/08/27/article-0-063396B8000005DC-918_468x409.jpg">http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/08/27/article-0-063396B8000005DC-918_468x409.jpg</a></p>

<p>In his opinion the reorganization or transformation had accomplished little except for the fact that budgetary matters were now being actually manipulated to direct and control research</p>

<p>Hmmm, that statement doesn&#39;t sound to me that compartmentalization accomplished very little.  In fact, if manipulation to direct and control research was the goal, then compartmentalization is a success.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And it&#39;s talking about a reorganisation in 2005, not the structure NASA had in the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s during Apollo.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Compartmentalization has gone back to at least WW2 so it&#39;s not out of the question that it would have been implemented during the 60&#39;s NASA era.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>in fact there was a large discussion at NASA over if the camera should even be sent since it served literally no scientific purpose. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why did they take the camera then?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Essentially the tapes only existed in the first place because a conversion needed to be made to allow the broadcast to be sent to normal TV&#39;s, they were then taken in a massive batch of over 200,000 tapes set to be recycled.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So our Military has been filming war footage as far back as WW2 for archival purposes but our govt doesn&#39;t see any significance in archiving moon footage?  I feel you&#39;re stretching things a bit.</p>

<p>On top of that, how are you going to defend the erasing of the moon footage when you didn&#39;t even know about it until now.  All you did was do a little research after I pointed to a source and then you found some source of your own and are going with it?  I&#39;ve said this before but you aren&#39;t that skeptical at all.</p>
