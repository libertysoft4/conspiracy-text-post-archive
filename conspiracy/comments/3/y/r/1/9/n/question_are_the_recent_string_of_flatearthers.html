From entertaining the idea of FE I learned quite a bit about some other things. I don&#39;t think the Earth is flat, my conclusion. But, TPTB are certainly lying to us about some things regarding space and science. Would never of learned certain things if I didn&#39;t entertain that idea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I learned more about how the whole Heliocentric/Newtonian science/math goes back to Pythagoras, who was proto-Masonic and majorly a part of Ancient Magic/Mystery schools (occult/esoteric/Hermeticism). I also learned about the Van Allen Radiation Belt (and how we still cannot get out of it), and how some of these satellites would have to be created to withstand the heat of LEO. <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/HST-SM4.jpeg">This could never withstand that heat.</a>. That is just a small sample, of the things I&#39;ve looked into, after FE.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m assuming you also learned that Isaac Newton was an occultist first and foremost.  He predicted an apocalypse in 2060, spent vast amounts of time and research looking into divination and the Philosopher&#39;s Stone, had an enormous library of occult artifacts, studied ancient texts looking for hidden codes within them, studied alchemy, etc., etc.</p>

<p>Point being he was <em>not</em> the hard scientist he&#39;s made out to be at all.  It would be more accurate to say he was mostly an alchemist/occultist in a way that was borderline obsessive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I too noticed that the Flat Earth thing is incredibly new--and incredibly inorganic.</p>

<p>Though there was a real Flat Earth society in the early 20th Century, it never had more than 20 members and no one talked about it for decades. Then suddenly about a year ago: Blammo! A million fake &quot;Flat Earth&quot; advocates flooding websites critical of government.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a classic technique for discrediting people. You send out shills who claim to agree with you on reasonable positions. Then, just as they seem to align with all your points of view, they&#39;ll suddenly throw in a &quot;Oh, and I also hate Jews&quot; or &quot;God hates fags&quot; to discredit you. To link you [falsely] with them.</p>

<p><em>Agents provacateurs</em> have been dispatched to do this for a few hundred years.</p>

<p>Back in the 1990s, the government had a big push to discredit the patriot movement by linking them with militia members and people who blow up abortion clinics. It&#39;s a method to scare away people from these movements which pose a real threat to the power structure.</p>

<p>They did it to the Ron Paul movement, too, turning the Tea Party movement into an &quot;evil racist bigoted Klan rally of hate&quot;. They had to do it because too many Democrats and Republicans were finding common ground in a love of freedom. Solution? Equate the movement with racism and watch people flee in terror of being associated with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is really messed up thing in my brain but I never associated Ron Paul with the tea party because I thought they were all idiots (and this is after talking to 2 of them for about an hour), and I&#39;ve always thought Ron Paul was very intelligent, well spoken and had some very good ideas, especially legalizing drugs.  That may have been the issue that made the two seemed incongruent.  I think that was the point and it was successful.  Republicans infiltrated like you said, and shut it down by klanification</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except when they aren&#39;t because of botnets.</p>

<p>I kind of wish that when you friended someone, you could see an upvote total derived only from your friends&#39; votes, and then in your prefs, per subreddit you could turn off the aggregate anyperson votes.  This would be less helpful in subs like <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> but very helpful in this one, which is rife with shilling.</p>

<p>I&#39;d actually pay for a reddit like that.  5/month max </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, and you should dig deeper into the theory than just googling &quot;curvature of earth from airplane at altitude.&quot;  If it was that simple to debunk there wouldn&#39;t be such a large flat earth community.  (It&#39;s larger than you probably think.)</p>

<p>Or alternatively: don&#39;t and ignore/downvote the threads that discuss it.</p>

<p>I spent months trying to come up with a way to debunk it simply and irrefutably and I am still not sure where I stand. I am certain that the earth is not exactly as we are taught.</p>

<p>No one is going to think any less of you because others are posting about the flat earth on this sub.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Earth bulges at the equator due to the Earth&#39;s rotation and it has an even slighter variation in the top and bottom halves. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why he says it&#39;s pear shaped. </p>

<p>However, this variation in shape is less than 1%, so it&#39;s closer to a perfect sphere than a pear. </p>
