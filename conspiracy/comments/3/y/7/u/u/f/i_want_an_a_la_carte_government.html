        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I want to pay for the things that I actually use in society.  I also don&#39;t want to pay for things I strongly disagree with in principle.  If we really are to be respected by our society, we should have this choice.  No one should have us pay the government for things that violate our principles, otherwise it violates our life, liberty and pursuit of happiness.  I can tell you stress is a killer of men, all medical studies show this easily.  I am stressed out a lot by having my taxes fund illegitimate wars, NSA spying on me and my family, and it also makes me happy.  I have a right to happiness and the governemnt steals that away from me with mountains of news stories of recent let-downs, gov failures, gov mistakes, inadequacies, crimes and intrigues.  I&#39;m tired of this shit.</p>

<p>I want an a-la-carte government.  I think many others do to.  We should demand it.</p>

<ul>
<li>I want to pay for social security</li>
<li>I want to pay for the elderly services</li>
<li>I want to pay for roads, bridges</li>
<li>I want to pay for the EPA if they do their job correctly and stop releasing toxic orange superfund sludge into colorado communities.</li>
<li>I want to pay for the FDA, if they do their job correctly and don&#39;t try to remove health supplements of any kind from the market, including ephedrine / ma huang (I&#39;m not a child).</li>
<li>I want to pay for the USDA, if they stop denigrating <em>organic</em> and other labels, stop preventing GMO labelling, stop sneaking GMO agendas into their services and politics.</li>
<li>I don&#39;t want to pay one more dollar to the military, except for their health benefits and reintegration into civilian live expenses.</li>
<li>I don&#39;t want to pay one more dollar to the NSA, CIA, FBI, DEA, DOJ, DOE, NRO, TSA, DIA, Apple computer, Microsoft or Google.</li>
<li>I don&#39;t want to pay one more dollar on a nuclear weapon of any kind, or any kind of space energy weapon, or psychotronic weapon.</li>
<li>I don&#39;t want to pay one more dollar on astroturfing brigading social media trolls that infiltrate reddit and warp people&#39;s opinions.  (NSA, HBGary, Booz-Allen-Hamilton, others)</li>
<li>I don&#39;t want to pay for traffic lights, but I will pay for roundabouts and safety studies to mandate car safety equipment.</li>
<li><em>I want to pay for police bulletproof vest</em>, but <strong>I don&#39;t want to pay for tanks, assault rifles and flash grenades for police!</strong></li>
<li>I don&#39;t want to pay for speed limit signs.</li>
<li>I want people&#39;s cars to be able to shoot paintballs of demerit at offending cars, cars that get too many paintballs in a window of time lose their license for a window of time.  If a car is extremely reckless, I want 3 nearby cars to have authority to power that car down and boot it, until the police can remove the boot.  That&#39;s how you deal with DUIs</li>
<li>I want agorism</li>
<li>I want the government to stop fighting bitcoin</li>
<li>I want to let banks and businesses fail when they are &#39;too big to fail&#39; -- this is what a free market actually is.  Otherwise it&#39;s elite-only socialism.</li>
<li>I want to pay for a single-payer healthcare system, regardless of the costs.</li>
<li>I want insurance of all kind to go away (maybe liability for auto accidents and property damage can stay)</li>
<li>I want the small business administration to finally go away.  It helped me 0% on 3 occassions when I was financially stable, willing, able and driven to open 3 different businesses.  This says to me they are a fraud enterprise.</li>
<li>I don&#39;t want to spend another dollar ever on the FCC</li>
<li>I want the government to admit that AT&amp;T is actually a government run corporation, used for spying both broadly (room 641A) and locally (utility trucks that mill around, appearing to be doing nothing)</li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a good idea. I envision a voluntaryist form of government in which we use a sort of direct democracy. No more corrupt representatives. We all get to vote on what we want and our vote includes us in a group. So maybe you vote for roads to get fixed up in your area, and you contribute money voluntarily to this road fund, which would then be used to hire private contractors to do the work. All associations would be voluntary and exist within a free market where those who provide the best service for the lowest fee will win out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok so the first requirement is an incorruptible, internet-based voting platform that is a) secure, b) durable, c) distributed, d) anonymous-vote ; authenticated access, e) citizen tallyable, f) whose code is open-source; and g) whose code is security audited by a large group of sec experts.</p>

<p>tails os + voting software + give to every citizen + they vote when they want within a window of time and can save proof offline as stub to verify via qrcode when national tally happens.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Then they all vote and cannabis is legalized next day.</p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t it make sense that someone who is passionate about a subject would have a lot of posts?

Not links to naturalnews, foodbabe, truthout, commondreams, that sort of bullshit spread by Sandy Hook deniers like ragecry or anti-corporate nutjobs like henrycorp.</p>

<p>There are lots of other users (eg. on <a href="/r/GMOmyths">/r/GMOmyths</a>) who dedicate time to dispeling myths around GE crops. Often that degenerates into dispeling myths about Monsanto because anti-GMOers have no credible arguments about GMOs. </p>

<p>American Medical Association: ”There is no scientific justification for special labeling of genetically modified foods. Bioengineered foods have been consumed for close to 20 years, and during that time, no overt consequences on human health have been reported and/or substantiated in the peer-reviewed literature.” (bit.ly/1u6fHay)</p>

<p>World Health Organization: ”No effects on human health have been shown as a result of the consumption of GM foods by the general population in the countries where they have been approved.” (<a href="http://bit.ly/18yzzVI">http://bit.ly/18yzzVI</a>)</p>

<p>National Academy of Sciences: ”To date, no adverse health effects attributed to genetic engineering have been documented in the human population.” (<a href="http://bit.ly/1kJm7TB">http://bit.ly/1kJm7TB</a>)</p>

<p>The Royal Society of Medicine: ”Foods derived from GM crops have been consumed by hundreds of millions of people across the world for more than 15 years, with no reported ill effects (or legal cases related to human health), despite many of the consumers coming from that most litigious of countries, the USA.” (<a href="http://1.usa.gov/12huL7Z">http://1.usa.gov/12huL7Z</a>)</p>

<p>The European Commission: ”The main conclusion to be drawn from the efforts of more than 130 research projects, covering a period of more than 25 years of research, and involving more than 500 independent research groups, is that biotechnology, and in particular GMOs, are no more risky than e.g. conventional plant breeding technologies.” (<a href="http://bit.ly/133BoZW">http://bit.ly/133BoZW</a>)</p>

<p>American Council on Science and Health: ”The consensus of scientific opinion is that the application of genetic modification technology introduces no unique food safety or environmental impact concerns and that there is no evidence of harm fromthose products that have been through a regulatory approval process.&quot; (<a href="http://bit.ly/1sBCrgF">http://bit.ly/1sBCrgF</a>)</p>

<p>agricultural and food biotechnology techniques can enhance the quality, safety, nutritional value, and variety of food available for human consumption and increase the efficiency of food production, food processing, food distribution, and environmental and waste management.” (<a href="http://1.usa.gov/12hvWnE">http://1.usa.gov/12hvWnE</a>)</p>

<p>American Phytopathological Society: ”The American Phytopathological Society (APS), which represents approximately 5,000 scientists who work with plant pathogens, the diseases they cause, and ways of controlling them, supports biotechnology as a means for improving plant health, food safety, and sustainable growth in plant productivity.” (<a href="http://bit.ly/14Ft4RL">http://bit.ly/14Ft4RL</a>)</p>

<p>American Society for Cell Biology: ”Far from presenting a threat to the public health, GM crops in many cases improve it. The ASCB vigorously supports research and development in the area of genetically engineered organisms, including the development of genetically modified (GM) crop plants.” (<a href="http://bit.ly/163sWdL">http://bit.ly/163sWdL</a>)</p>

<p>American Society for Microbiology: ”The ASM is not aware of any acceptable evidence that food produced with biotechnology and subject to FDA oversight constitutes high risk or is unsafe. We are sufficiently convinced to assure the public that plant varieties and products created with biotechnology have the potential of improved nutrition, better taste and longer shelf-life.” (<a href="http://bit.ly/13Cl2ak">http://bit.ly/13Cl2ak</a>)</p>

<p>American Society of Plant Biologists: ”The risks of unintended consequences of this type of gene transfer are comparable to the random mixing of genes that occurs during classical breeding… The ASPB believes strongly that, with continued responsible regulation and oversight, GE will bring many significant health and environmental benefits to the world and its people.” (<a href="http://bit.ly/13bLJiR">http://bit.ly/13bLJiR</a>)</p>

<p>International Seed Federation: ”The development of GM crops has benefited farmers, consumers and the environment… Today, data shows that GM crops and foods are as safe as their conventional counterparts: millions of hectares worldwide have been cultivated with GM crops and billions of people have eaten GM foods without any documented harmful effect on human health or the environment.” (<a href="http://bit.ly/138rZLW">http://bit.ly/138rZLW</a>)</p>

<p>Council for Agricultural Science and Technology: ”Over the last decade, 8.5 million farmers have grown transgenic varieties of crops on more than 1 billion acres of farmland in 17 countries. These crops have been consumed by humans and animals in most countries. Transgenic crops on the market today are as safe to eat as their conventional counterparts, and likely more so given the greater regulatory scrutiny to which they are exposed.” (<a href="http://bit.ly/11cTKq9">http://bit.ly/11cTKq9</a>)</p>

<p>Crop Science Society of America: ”The Crop Science Society of America supports education and research in all aspects of crop production, including the judicious application of biotechnology.” (<a href="http://bit.ly/1sBD8qv">http://bit.ly/1sBD8qv</a>)</p>

<p>International Society of African Scientists: ”Africa and the Caribbean cannot afford to be left further behind in acquiring the uses and benefits of this new agricultural revolution.” (<a href="http://bit.ly/14Fp1oK">http://bit.ly/14Fp1oK</a>)</p>

<p>Federation of Animal Science Societies: ”Meat, milk and eggs from livestock and poultry consuming biotech feeds are safe for human consumption.” (<a href="http://bit.ly/133F79K">http://bit.ly/133F79K</a>)</p>

<p>Society for In Vitro Biology: ”The SIVB supports the current science-based approach for the evaluation and regulation of genetically engineered crops. The SIVB supports the need for easy public access to available information on the safety of genetically modified crop products. In addition, the SIVB feels that foods from genetically modified crops, which are determined to be substantially equivalent to those made from crops, do not require mandatory labeling.” (<a href="http://bit.ly/18yFDxo">http://bit.ly/18yFDxo</a>)</p>

<p>Consensus document on GMOs Safety (14 Italian scientific societies): ”GMOs on the market today, having successfully passed all the tests and procedures necessary to authorization, are to be considered, on the basis of current knowledge, safe to use for human and animal consumption.” (<a href="http://bit.ly/166WHYZ">http://bit.ly/166WHYZ</a>)</p>

<p>Society of Toxicology: ”Scientific analysis indicates that the process of GM food production is unlikely to lead to hazards of a different nature than those already familiar to toxicologists. The level of safety of current GM foods to consumers appears to be equivalent to that of traditional foods.” (<a href="http://bit.ly/13bOaSt">http://bit.ly/13bOaSt</a>)</p>
