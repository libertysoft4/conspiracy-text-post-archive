Edit...everyone bashing me....please take it easy.  I am not a Flat Eather..I am a Truth Seeker. A wise man once told me do not believe anything just because someone tells you so...find your own evidence and discuss it with open-minded people.  That is all I am trying to do.  I know many of you guys have dealt with disinformation and such..and are fed up with this particular theory..but if R/Conspiracy becomes a place where a guy gets bashed for asking a question about a conspiracy without even getting facts...how does that make us any different than CNN News? I am genuine in my question and am asking for your help.  I am not trying to disinform anyone....I never even made a statement, only a question.  If attempting to hold an open dialogue is wrong I am sorry..and perhaps I am in the wrong sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i suspect..</p>

<p>the earth isnt flat or whatever, but there&#39;s something else about the nature of earth and outer space they&#39;re hiding - that they&#39;re using &#39;flat earth&#39; as a cover for.</p>

<p>i&#39;m leaning towards some sort of <a href="/r/holofractal">/r/holofractal</a> double-torus structure, which implies energy is being emitted from the poles. if energy is emitted from the poles, that implies that there&#39;s a sort of oasis at each pole, similar to how undersea life thrives deep geo-thermal vents. and note that civilians are strictly forbidden from traveling anywhere near the poles.</p>

<p>edit: related?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>check out <a href="/r/holofractal">/r/holofractal</a> and its sidebar links - the idea is that reality is the same repeating patterns of double-toroids from the subatomic level to the planetary level to the galactic level. gets into sacred geometry and tesla stuff.

    <div class="md"><p>No problem! I&#39;ve debated flat earthers in the past, mostly because it&#39;s an interesting intellectual challenge and I think it helps maintain my mental dexterity, so I enjoy coming up with these kinds of things.</p>

<p>There are also some interesting experiments you can use to demonstrate the curvature of the earth, <a href="http://www.astro.princeton.edu/%7Edns/teachersguide/MeasECAct.html">like this one</a>, though it requires access to an ocean that you can watch the sun rise or set over. If you live near a very flat desert, you might be able to use a telescope and a straight pole with a yardstick attached to measure the curvature from a few miles away (not sure though, said desert would have to be almost PERFECTLY level).</p>

<p>Beyond experiments you can do yourself, consider speaking to people who deal with the curvature of the earth in their everyday jobs. Surveyers, snipers, artillery gunners, navigators, truckers, hell, even a local DirecTV technician comes to mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That does not make the question appropriate.  It&#39;s not to your credit that you entertain inappropriate questions.  It demonstrates that you are intellectually weak, and probably an under-30-year-old who has been raised in the new culture of celebrating stupidity in the name of political correctness and open-mindedness.</p>

<p>You have nothing to be proud of when you entertain inappropriate questions.  It&#39;s not a positive quality.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t appropriate for me to show you any respect.  You have earned this derision by posting an inappropriate question.  It doesn&#39;t matter whether you believe its possible for a question to be inappropriate.  Your bad education is your problem.</p>

Hmm, I was also embarrassed to ask if girls had weiners when I was 5...even though it turned out that they, in fact, DID NOT have wieners, I am sure glad I asked.

    <div class="md"><p>Hard to respond to illogical claims without calling it what it is, delusional.</p>

<p>If the Earth was flat, explain gravity and how it would behave in a flat world?  How about the moons gravitational tug on Earth creating tides?  Or do you consider gravity a hoax as most Flat Earthers do?</p>

<p>When it is night time how come the sun can still be seen elsewhere?  Wouldn&#39;t it be all or none?  Unless you consider the sun very small, but still it would surely be visible from everywhere at the same time would it not?</p>

<p>Where is Earth&#39;s edges?  If you traveled in a straight line, wouldn&#39;t you eventually find an edge?  If you fly a plane leaving from New York and arrive back in New York without turning around, how could the Earth be flat?  Same with a boat, although it would take a long time and it could not be done in a straight path.</p>

<p>My suggestion:  Don&#39;t question what is already proven.  Focus on things that have a valid question or alternate possibility based on observable evidence.  The &quot;Flat Earth&quot; idea is not a &quot;theory&quot; nor would I classify it as a testable hypothesis.  Thus, it is completely false and those seeking to prove otherwise have discarded reality for fiction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your legitimate response.  Makes a lot of sense.  I thought the same.  I read something from a Flat Earther who suggested that the SouthPole really was the end of the earth and that technically noone had ever documented visiting its end.  I think they said something along the lines of a governmental truce existed and that noone can venture to the south pole without a license and an escort.  They also claim that the horrible ice, weather etc, makes travel to its ends almost impossible.  I agree with you for the most part, the theory sounds incredibly unlikely.  You can call me lazy, but I was simply hoping someone with more time/knowledge on the subject could help me counter those points.  I truly am not a disinformation agent and do not mean to upset anyone.  I simply have learned my lesson about blindly believing ANYTHING..I use to believe in religion and a bunch of other stuff until I actually was able to open my mind.  Again, I thank you for taking the time to actually answer me seriously. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have never censored anyone? I may be confused by you comment, so I apologize if that is not what you were suggesting.  But my original intent and question was directed at BOTH flat earth believers AND deniers to to come use this platform to discuss their views regarding this topic and bring supporting evidence.  People attempted to censor me, downvote me and insulted me based on my question, even though I clearly stated that I am not a flat earther.  I simply found it interesting that some people are believers and I wanted more information so that I could come to a 100% conclusion.  Like I stated, I find it unlikely, however I also use to find it unlikely that One Central Bank could cause so many problems...UNTIL I became more open minded and started discussion with more informed people.  Honestly, this post and it’s comments did lead to some valuable information for me, and I find myself NOT believing the Flat Earth Theory.  Even the people who bashed me (said I fell on my head as a baby...called me a basement dwelling momma’s boy who could not read, spell and was retarded) I treated with respect and did not discourage them from commenting. All I asked was that they understand that I am a real Truth Seeker, an enemy of the Illuminati, and was genuine in my question; simply attempting to come to a place of like-minded people to have a debate that hopefully could further my knowledge.   </p>

<p>I have never censored anyone?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn&#39;t say you had. But people have been censored simply for expressing their opinion. It&#39;s just that the mods have decided which opinions they will censor and which they will allow.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People attempted to censor me, downvote me and insulted me based on my question, even though I clearly stated that I am not a flat earther.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you walk into the middle of an argument and start asking people to &quot;talk about it&quot;... you usually just piss off both sides of the argument.</p>

<p>The fact is, there has been a rush of &quot;flat earth&quot; posts made by obvious trolls or plain stupid people. Not one or two, but dozens of them. Then you come along and make another one.</p>

<p>Why would you expect people that are sick of such bullshit to be civil?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Like I stated, I find it unlikely, however I also use to find it unlikely that One Central Bank could cause so many problems...UNTIL</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those two claims are not even in the same realm. Even fools know that central banks set monetary policy and thus have a major affect on the economy. That was their purpose, after all.</p>

<p>What you are doing is saying &quot;because this obviously true claim turned out to be true, this obviously false claim could be true too.&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s bullshit, and it&#39;s why I doubt you when you say you do not believe in these bullshit &quot;flat earth&quot; theories. And I&#39;m being kind. I could say you&#39;re just keeping them going for the same reason the trolls are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am keeping noone going.  Like I said, many people answered my questions and presented me with new leads, new things to check out.  Flyyyyyyyyyy even gave me a legit reason as to WHY people may be pushing this Flat Earth Theory down our throats, other than to just discredit other conspiracies. That seems beneficial, and well worth the wrath of people like who, who no matter how obvious I make it that I am not a troll or a flat earth agent or a disinformation agent, would rather insult, than discuss.  Either way, I appreciate your input.   &quot;The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.&quot;

<p>Maybe so... what were you hoping to accomplish? You claimed it was to generate a conversation and that you had no intent to push any agenda? Well, here I am giving it to you, but <em>now</em> you&#39;re not interested in an adverse conversation?</p>

<p>Amazing. You finally concluded something human kind has known for centuries? You finally accept the abundant evidence that has existed for decades?</p>

<p>How noble of you. Care to weigh in on the theory of gravity? Are you convinced gravity exists? Because gravity is one of the things that has proved the earth <em>can&#39;t</em> be flat, since Newton first explained it to us centuries ago.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, Truth is what I live for.  This post did its purpose.  I got some critical information both pro and con the flat earth theory. (1) I know why some people believe it.  (2) I know why most don&#39;t. (3) I know why some of those who do not believe it do not even want to HEAR about it and get incredibly hostile.  My question was genuine and I got some genuine responses.  I am now solid in my belief that the Earth is in deed round.  I am also personally classifying this theory as the same as the Annunaiki theory which is that it is here to provide disinformation, even though many who believe it may simply be confused and are not hostile intent.  I am NOT however going to keep entertaining your ignorant and rude comments.  We have had about 12 responses back and forth and all twelve times I have said the same thing, which is that I am not a damn troll nor an agent.  Instead of you saying &quot;Ok man, glad you finally came around to the light&quot;, you keep insulting me. I am a Truth Seeker and an enemy of the Illuminati.  You keep insulting me, asking me if I believe in gravity? Since intelligent responses do not satisfy you, I decided perhaps gravy would calm you down, since you remind me of ed from Ed Edd and Eddie.  </p>

<p>That is such a lame and whiny excuse.  This is not the appropriate forum for ridiculous nonsense, but there are many opponents to this forum who would like to &quot;slide&quot; it into ignominy.  One tactic in play is the posting of Flat Earth Psychosis drivel to this sub.</p>

<p>The question you asked does not belong on this sub, and is so ridiculously stupid that its presence on this sub discredits the sub.  An outsider might think that this sub seriously entertains the psychotic fantasies of you flat earthers.</p>

<p>Your comment karma is already negative for a reason.  Today, it will become more negative.  This is a good thing.  Reddit has an inherent function that squelches disruptive posters such as yourself.</p>

Originally I posted a little about my personal conspiracy beliefs so people could understand why I am asking a question that many would find ridiculous, if that is a problem or distraction just ignore it and answer the proposed question.  Or better yet, if you believe I am off topic, simple ignore my question and move on the other countless Conspiracy Posts.....

I felt equally as strongly when I was a christian and anyone who doubted Jesus must have been a mi-guided idiot.  Turns out (in MY opinion) I was the misguided one.

The question becomes where do we draw the line that we no longer discuss things without insulting others.  I am sure many people have bashed you the same as you as bashing me right now for a certain Conspiracy that you truly belief.

    <div class="md"><p>Because it’s wrong. Definitionally.</p>

<p>The concept of rooting out conspiracy hinges on evidence FOR a conspiracy. Evidence, by definition, is FACTUAL INFORMATION either unknown to the general public or the knowledge thereof being suppressed.</p>

<p>Anyone with a couple hundred dollars can buy a balloon and a ruggedized camera and see that the Earth isn’t fucking flat.</p>

<p>If the only answer that these mental defectives will accept is seeing it for themselves, then put them all on a rocket and shoot them into space. It’s a win win. They get the proof they want and they’re out of our hair forever.</p>
