<p>Please explain logically how this feat of deception is possible on such a grand scale, how it was done, who ordered it, and for what purpose ? Also keep in mind China, Russia and a few other countries or groups would be on the investigation with much more capabilities than all of you conspiriscists combined and have a purpose to do so. </p>

<p>So who is to blame ? Aliens, council of 13, government, Rothschild&#39;s, Satan ? Bonus points if you can also explain images from satellites, probes, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah i don&#39;t believe all science is faked ... i mean, who created math then and how smart were they so it all makes such an awesome sense when you do some calculations? it&#39;s brilliant if it&#39;s all fake.</p>

<p>and i don&#39;t believe we faked moon landing either. sure they tried to, or have just for backup, but faking, forging all these images, thousands were released just a few months ago, i mean it would take some <em>serious effort</em> just to fake these and we all know governments are incompetent. let alone have a conspiracy hidden this well  70 some years later.</p>

<p>what i am eager about is see the results of some independent projects, make a drone, send it the moon and make some pics, it&#39;s not that expensive anymore.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll see when we start sending probes, if it was faked our government would crumble from lack of credibility but by then they&#39;ll probably roll out martial law or terminators at that point.</p>

<p>Therein lies your problem.  You&#39;ve already defined what you are and are not willing to accept without having been offered any evidence in support of (or leveled-against) either position.</p>

<p>At this point it&#39;s probably best to refer you back to my previous comment above about jerking yourself off.</p>

<p>Entire books have been written on the why the approach we took to go to the moon in the 1960s was not sustainable from an economic or political perspective. Just because we haven&#39;t been back yet doesn&#39;t mean the originally landings didn&#39;t happen. We have many individuals from around the world working to make it so future landings can be done in a more affordable and repeatable fashion, as well as continuing on to Mars. </p>

<p>On the moon landing, it was an hoax orchestrated by the American govt and all the other govts chimed in. Because that is the only way to rule over the citizens via deception. It happens on a smaller scale in our lives, what makes it so different on a grander scale as well? How naive do you have to be to think the wealthy and powerful people don&#39;t lie to you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People always bring up the moon landing as an example of a &quot;wacky&quot; conspiracy that could never happen. Probably because the lie is so great, no one thinks it could be pulled off. If the moon landing happened, there would be overwhelming scientific evidence that it happened. Instead, there&#39;s a massive amount of scientific anomalies. Here&#39;s a list of such anomalies:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>No evidence of any radiation other than visible light on the pictures.</p>

<li>No evidence that the PLSS ever vented any gas, water exhaust, or other materials</li>
<li>Insufficient shielding on the spacesuits to protect against ionizing radiation</li>
<li>Liftoff pattern as filmed by NASA shows a linear progression, rather than an exponential progression. (Exponential progression is how a rocket would act. Linear is how being lifted by a crane would act.)</li>
<li>No evidence that the liftoff engines used hypergolic fuels.</li>
<li>No explanation for how the LM weighed all the alleged moon rocks they brought back. (Fuel is precious, and they allegedly brought back hundreds of kilos of rock.)</li>
<li>Dosimeter readings don&#39;t agree with modern radiation levels. (In other words, when the astronauts &quot;got back&quot;, the scientists said their dosimeter readings were within expected calculations. Then 30-40 years later, scientists find out the moon is much more radioactive than once believed. Why wasn&#39;t this reflected in the dosimeter readings?)</li>
<li>Insufficient shielding on the capsule to prevent against micrometeors</li>
<li>Insufficient shielding on the capsule to prevent against ionizing radiation</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>That&#39;s just off the top of my head. There&#39;s many more.
And this isn&#39;t taking into account the ludicrous engineering standards we&#39;re supposed to believe went into this. For example, the first time anyone tested how mammalian cells would behave beyond Earth&#39;s magnetosphere was allegedly on Apollo 8, when the first manned test of the Atlas V rocket was sent on a circumlunar orbit. It seems insane to test whether or not the environment outside Earth&#39;s magnetosphere is suitable for humans by sending humans as your first test subject.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s add to that that no other country has been back in 40+ years - despite the fact that technology increases over time, not decreases. We allegedly went to the moon 40 years ago but don&#39;t have the technology to do it now? (And the argument that it costs too much is moot. The proposed moon landing mission by Bush (which has since been cancelled) set a landing date of 2020 when first announced. Why such a long date? Why not use the tech that worked 6/7 times in the first place?)</p>

<p>Finally, the idea that Russia would &quot;blow the whistle&quot; as a counterargument to the above is insufficient. Not only does this not explain away any of the scientific anomalies. But one may argue (calling upon the work of Antony C. Sutton) that the US financed the USSR from Day 1, and that the cold war was a scam to line the pockets of the military industrial complex. One might also point out the great grain robbery of 1972, which also might buy a lot of silence from our alleged enemies.</p>

<p>If you think the moon landings happened, and think it&#39;s just too far fetched that this could have been faked, I urge you to do some basic research. The behaviour of NASA surrounding the Apollo missions is bizarre. (BTW, NASA lost all the original telemetry data and film footage of the alleged greatest engineering feat of all time. Whoops.)</p>

<p>The more research one does into this subject, the more obvious it becomes the moon landings never happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am still in the beginning phases of this stuff, but I will explain what I&#39;ve come across to the best of my ability. The theory that has made the most sense to me is that the moon landings were not completely faked, but partially faked. By this, I mean that NASA went to the moon, but when they got there, they found that there was already an alien lunar base on the dark side of the moon. Since that point, the moon landings have been faked with the purpose of hiding the alien existence/presence. As far as why this was done, I couldn&#39;t really tell you. One thing I&#39;ve heard is that the aliens do not want to reveal themselves to us, because they know that we would turn to them to solve our problems, rather than solving them ourselves, and thus growing as a species. There is evidence out there to backup that this is the case, just like there is evidence out there to argue against it. So it really comes down to what you personally choose to believe. To me, it makes sense logically, but I don&#39;t draw any conclusions about it, as I haven&#39;t seen definitive evidence. Hope that helps you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well one thing that I saw in an interview with an &quot;insider&quot; is that they are monitoring an experiment. The premise of this being that these alien beings actually created humanity by crossing their own genetic structure with that of the original &quot;humans&quot; that inhabited the earth, but left centuries ago. Again, another idea I&#39;ve heard is that they are waiting for us to evolve to the point of being able to accept their existence without turning to them as our saviors. The idea being that they previously visited humanity, in ancient times, and were seen as gods. It all comes down to what you choose to believe. For me personally, I think it makes sense, or at least the logic behind it is sound, but I try not to jump to conclusions without evidence. May I ask what your thoughts are on the subject?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going straight to the source no time to read that bullshit I&#39;ll just ask them personally.</p>

<p>There is a reason they want control and it&#39;s not as simple as power or greed, surprisingly many people don&#39;t put themselves in their shoes. I guarantee you there is a purpose for all this and it&#39;s for our benefit and survival.</p>

<p>Why the hell else would they be gathering resources, power and control ? Probably to prepare us all for a world changing event, particularly one that strains our survival and would require us to leave the solar system.</p>

<p>But you obviously can&#39;t take billions, 144,000 sounds about right.</p>

<p>if that&#39;s true &amp; i think it is, obviously &quot;we&quot; (humans) are newbies, aliens have been living longer than us &amp; know more than us. no, they won&#39;t save us from ourselves, we have to evolve to that realization. i hope there&#39;s still <em>time</em> to get there. </p>

<p>maybe humans are the experiment, we were created &amp; here we go again, running amok, trashing everything. hope this civilization isn&#39;t &quot;reset&quot;, only to begin all over again, not knowing (or remembering) anything about what was before. </p>
