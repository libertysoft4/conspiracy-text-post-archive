        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was watching a youtube series called : &quot;The World at War&quot; when I heard something that was absolutely applicable today. The question of why doesn&#39;t a population realize that it lives under tyranny and why it doesn&#39;t revolt.</p>

<p>The excerpt I cued up includes an interview with two Germans. One who explains the difficulty that people have with uprisings and the second who explain how they were duped and why they didn&#39;t think of revolting and overthrowing Hitler earlier.</p>

<p>This rings very true of American empire rule and how the government makes changes through slight of hand (passing authoritarian laws hidden in other laws), slowly and always making changes in a way that goes almost unnoticed...</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/GYVb37GdQa0?t=41m9s">Here</a> is the clip.</p>

<p>Note:  earlier in the documentary, they explain how Hitler created an atmosphere of national pride which was used to boost the economy and foster an environment where you were shamed, ostracized, jailed, or even secretly killed if you didn&#39;t agree... Sadly, this sounds very familiar with today&#39;s america... </p>

The real story of how Jewish Bolsheviks very very disproportionately dominated the communists, their atrocities, as willing executioners,  and planners of the Communist terror.

Then later they are labeling all muslims by trump wanting them to all register like the jews with the stars.

<p>Sounds like most totalitarian governments ever.</p>

<p>In fact, Hitler himself said as much.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This is categorically false.  The Soviet Union didn&#39;t even exist when capitalist countries had claimed all of the Middle East, South-East Asia, India, Pakistan, Africa and South America.  The USSR inherited the vast majority of its empire from the anti-communist Russian empire adding only Georgia and a part of Finland during the Communist Era. They never waged a war to prop up a puppet regime except Afghanistan and to a lesser extent Hungary (though they did engage in military actions in the Eastern Bloc and the Caucasus they were nothing compared to Afghanistan or European repression in their actual colonies).  </p>

<p>Nazi Germany waged imperialist war for 6 of its 12 years and had engaged in successful non-military imperialist grabs in Austria and Czechoslovakia before that.  Germany, Spain and Italy all had African colonies, hence empires, at the time of WW2 and the USSR had none.</p>

<p>Saying that Communism started more wars is at least as incorrect.  Aside from skirmishes with the Chinese and the 4 instances mentioned above (two of which were to prop up puppet regimes not gain territory) all of the USSR&#39;s wars have been defensive.  Similarly for Communist China.  Aside from the reconquest of Tibet, which they had controlled from 1720-1913 and claimed only technically until 1950, their only offensive wars were skirmishes with Soviets and a tiny border annexation against India.  The only war they engaged in to support a client state was the Korean War.</p>

<p>Saying that all Communist nations in history have caused more deaths in imperial wars than Germany did in 6 years is massively false.</p>

<p>Also, while technically still a monarchy, well before World War 2 the Emperor was a figurehead and Japan was ruled by industrialists and militarists which is a hallmark of fascism.  Their wars of aggression started in Manchuria where they founded Manchukuo before Hitler had even risen to power.  They also annexed Taiwan in 1895, engaged in a war of aggression against Russia in 1904-05 and intended to annex the rest of China as well as the Philipines (successful) and Southeast Asia (partly successful) during WW2.</p>

<p>The real difference is not Imperialism or starting wars, though there are differences there opposite to the ones you list.  The real differences is that fascist states maintained capitalist economies with private sector influence over the government and communist countries abolished the private sector and ran industry and commerce through the government.  Also, while Fascist regimes relied on nationalism for public support, communist regimes stressed solidarity among the workers as a source of support.  Both used militarism and scapegoating.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Most Empires existed long before modern capitalism</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But the major European empires from the late 16th to mid 20th centuries were forged under monarchical capitalism which differs little from fascism.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>More wars that the fascists? That is 100% correct. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fascist Italy attacked Ethiopia before World War 2 and aided the fascist takeover of Spain greatly and had ambitions of creating a new Roman empire.  During WW2 Italy invaded Kenya, Sudan, British Somaliland Egypt and France.  </p>

<p>Germany invaded Poland, Russia, Norway, Greece, Yugoslavia, Denmark, Luxembourg, The Netherlands and Belgium.</p>

<p>Japan invaded China on three separate occasions (two after 1922), The Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Hong Kong, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam.</p>

<p>The USSR invaded Finland and Georgia and propped up the puppet governments of Hungary and Afghanistan through force.  They led the Russian revolution.</p>

<p>China invaded Tibet and propped up North Korea with force.</p>

<p>Invasions from 1922-1945; parenthetical values include aiding friendly regimes militarily:</p>

<p>Italy: Ethiopia, Kenya, Sudan, British Somaliland, Egypt and France.   6.</p>

<p>Spain: 0</p>

<p>Germany: Poland, Russia, Norway, Greece, Yugoslavia, Denmark, Luxembourg, The Netherlands and Belgium and aided Italy in North Africa.  9 (10).</p>

<p>Japan:  China (2), The Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Hong Kong, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam.  9.</p>

<p>Communist invasions 1919-present.</p>

<p>The Soviet Union: Georgia, Finland aided Afghanistan and Hungary with force.  2 (4).</p>

<p>China: Tibet, aided North Korea with force.  1 (2).</p>

<p>North Korea: South Korea.  1.</p>

<p>So from 1922-1945 fascist states engaged in 15 wars of aggression of 24 if you include Japan and 1 military intervention on behalf of an ally.</p>

<p>From 1919 to the present, communist nations engaged in 4 wars of aggression and militarily supported 3 allied regimes with force.  </p>

<p>The death toll from all the communist led invasions and interventions is well under 4 million, about 2.5-3 million in the Korean War and 800,000 in Afghanistan, the rest much lower.  By contrast, the death toll of the German invasion of Russia <em>alone</em> is generally put around 27 million Russian.  The Japanese invasion of China is put between 15 and 10 million Chinese deaths.</p>

<p>In 24 years fascists initiated 16 to 26 wars depending on your definition.  Over 71 years communists initiated 4 or 7 by the same definitions.  The death toll of fascist initiated wars is well over 70 million perhaps as high as 87 million.  The communist death total is under 4 million.</p>

<p>100% correct?  Yeah... no.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Nice attempt to redirect the discussion.  That&#39;s not what we were talking about was it?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fascists regimes relied on and stressed solidarity among the workers of their own nation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obviously they weren&#39;t going to propagandize their own workforces, but solidarity among workers including across nations was the central theme in early communism.  Not that important either way, really.</p>

<p>Regardless, even if you choose to ignore non-fascist imperialism (which I didn&#39;t actually include or mean to be included anyway) the results are still clear that fascist states in 23 years invaded 4 to 6 times more nations than did communist states over 71 years leading to a death toll about 20 times greater than those initiated by communist states.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s true. I was just thinking about today that our lives have declined based on the lies told to us by rich people. When Americans have asked for raises to the minimum wage in order to keep up with rising inflation, they said Americans were lazy, entitled, didn&#39;t want to work hard, frivolous spenders, etc. They blamed the victims for their plight.</p>

<p>They said we would lose our jobs to China and Mexico if we didn&#39;t agree to work for lower wages. But really that&#39;s moving the goalposts, and a false dichotomy. China and Mexico both are notoriously terrible for human rights, workers rights, and general workplace ethics. For gods sake, the suicide prevention nets at FoxConn in China are a running joke! How hilarious it is that Chinese people are imprisoned and exploited, to the point to where they lose all mental capacity to live. And the false dichotomy is that either Americans accept increasingly worse living and labor conditions, or we will have our economy ruined even faster by greedy corporations who make a profit off of wage slavery.</p>

<p>But as long as the &quot;middle class&quot; still has some money to consume, the vast majority will stay ignorant to the greater changes around them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not to mention the fact that amazon.com releasing a sci fi series describing a world in which the Nazis won, &quot;the man in the high castle&quot; written by a sci fi artist dead for decades, seems almost too much like a social commentary on the thread of ultra-nationalism in modern day, post 911 america</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What fucking world do you live in where anyone in America is trying to foster national pride? Patriotism is frowned upon everywhere except the farthest right groups. Patriotism is frowned upon on every news station but Fox, and even Fox hates the wrong kinds of patriotism. Patriotism is frowned upon in public schools, where as far as I can tell most have stopped saying the national anthem / pledge of allegiance except maybe at football games, and only there because it&#39;s tradition and football coaches tend to be farther right.</p>

<p>National pride no longer exists in America, and you&#39;re a retard if you think national pride is what is hurting us. It&#39;s the hatred of our country and its borders that is killing America.</p>

<p>Disagreeing with those in office is seen as hip, and ever since 9/11 it&#39;s been taken as a given that every national tragedy was a hoax or inside job. No one trusts the government. No one agrees with the government. No one believes in the government. And no one is fighting for this country. They&#39;re fighting for oil and money and free college, but they&#39;re not fighting for this country.</p>

<p>Do you downvote because you still think Americans are patriotic, or simply because you hate being told that you are wrong?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps if they worshiped the flag, our country wouldn&#39;t be such a goddamn mess.</p>

<p>Perhaps if we had a smaller media machine, with fewer tentacles, our country wouldn&#39;tbe such a goddamn mess.</p>

<p>Perhaps the problem isn&#39;t patriotism.</p>

<p>Perhaps the problem is the anti-patriot (yes, even Fox) media.</p>

<p>But I mean, go ahead and blame patriotism for a failing country that hates itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Similarities you give:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>people live there</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People lived in Nazi Germany and people live in USA. Ergo the US is a Nazi facist state. I see  you&#39;re really working that grey matter today.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>was there a government in place ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What exactly are you asking or by virtue implying ? If its that Nazi Germany had a government and since the US also has a government it must also be Nazi&#39;ish then you need to rinse out your do your douchcanoe .</p>
