    <div class="md"><p>Agreed.</p>

<p>This is not to say that promoting the views of a specific group should be free from criticism, but the fact is <em>every</em> group is subject to manipulation by the power elites.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter whether we&#39;re talking about the NRA or PETA... any group that has a loud enough voice to move millions of people to act is the exact kind of group the power elites most want to subvert.</p>

<p>The problem is that many here (and elsewhere in the wider community) think <em>their</em> group is clean and everyone else&#39;s is corrupt.</p>

<p>They are <em>all</em> corrupt. Period. If they are not, they would be destroyed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, it doesn&#39;t even have to be constructive or meaningful.</p>

<p>The first step to making a movement is making a connection. So the power elites use <em>every</em> means they can find to divide us. Fat vs thin. Black vs white. American vs Russian. It&#39;s all the same. The power elites do not give a fuck about anything but maintaining their power, no matter the cost.</p>

<p>You like Keeping up with the Kardashians? There are millions of people that hate you for it. You <em>hate</em> Keeping up with the Kardashians? There are millions of people that hate you for it.</p>

<p>As long as none of them are paying attention to what the power elites do, then they are safe.</p>

<p>The truth is even the people who love the things you hate have more in common with you than any of the power elites. The power elites just don&#39;t want <em>you</em> to realise it.</p>

<p>We <em>should</em> listen to everyone, and we <em>should</em> find common ground. But instead we focus on the differences that keep us divided, just like the power elites want.</p>

<p>Wut. That&#39;s just nutty. This is just saying &quot;I don&#39;t like it, other people do, its a conspiracy&quot;</p>

<p>And nobody has ever reported on our massacres. When lancet reported a million had died in the Iraq war what was the response of the press? Uniform condemnation. Has anyone in the press covered the radiation poisoning in Fallujah caused by the DU the marines used in 2003? You can see this going back decades. Just like with the lancet report all through the 1980s reports of the Central American massacres like the El Mozote massacre carried out by American trained death squads - the unit that did that had just returned home 2 days earlier from training at the School of the Americas at Ft Bragg - were hounded by the rightwing and the government, the journalists who reported on Mozote lost their jobs the papers retracted their story. Nobody reported on Indonesia&#39;s invasion of East Timor in the 1970s, 90% of their arms came from America and they only be used for defense and the USA increased arms sales as it went on and nobody noticed.</p>

<p>This is not reported because the media are corporations or components of larger corporations. They have shareholders. They have advertisers. They rely on government sourcing. The journalists and editors and producers have gone through elite education institutes where you internalise the views and values of the rich and learn there are certain things it is not proper to do.</p>

<p>People have different priorities. Maybe those priorities are different to yours. Its not a plot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you mean &#39;what would they want to subvert PETA for&#39;?</p>

<p>Well, just one idea is that animal rights threatens corporate farming, and what better way to turn most people off than by subverting the most well known organisation and have them say and do things that people who are actually concerned about animals would despise?</p>

<p>Many people who would support banning the corporate farming practices that harm millions of animals each year for no other reason than increased profit, are turned off by PETA&#39;s anti-pet attitude and actions.</p>

<p>After all, pet owners are the most likely people to believe their animal should not be abused, and thus most likely to vote to have <em>all</em> animals protected from abuse. But PETA turns them into &#39;enemies&#39; of the animal rights movement.</p>

<p>There are indeed problems there but just remember if you want free range eggs with the chickens walking around with 1,500 per hectare, or better yet 750 per hectare, you need to either increase the amount of farmland or reduce the supply.</p>

<p>Or maybe we need to stop throwing away 25% (at least) of the food we produce? Corporations simply destroy perfectly good food to protect their profit margins. Too much supply means lower prices, and we already supply more than we need.</p>

<p>But that is irrelevant. I&#39;m not arguing for animal rights, I&#39;m simply pointing out that the most well known &quot;animal rights&quot; group on the planet seems to go out of its way to alienate the very people it needs to support its <em>apparent</em> goal of protecting animal rights, and asking if it could be because the elites have subverted PETA in order to actually drive people away from the animal rights movement.</p>

<p>There is such a thing as keeping <em>too</em> open a mind. If you tolerate other ideas, other ideologies, and so forth enough eventually you yourself will start to absorb them unless you remain skeptical and question everything... which is exactly the opposite of keeping an open mind.</p>

<p>Keeping an &#39;open mind&#39; to the point where you accept everything someone tells you, <del>even</del> especially if it&#39;s someone you feel you can trust, will lead to your own beliefs and ideals being subverted with theirs.</p>

<p>This is, in and of itself, a conspiracy--a method of subverting a community by coming in, becoming well known and trusted, then slowly pushing it where you want it to go.</p>

<p>Should we allow people to speak their opinions? Certainly.</p>

<p>Should we simply accept everything they say, because we&#39;re being <em>fair</em> and <em>tolerant</em>? Absolutely not.</p>

<p>TL;DR: <em>Keep too open a mind and someone is bound to shit in it.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would ask this: Do you support him because he does things you agree with, or because he is a Democrat?</p>

<p>Left wingers can be just as blind and stupid as right wingers. Here is some personal experience that might explain what I mean:</p>

<p>Back in the early 1990&#39;s, the right wing party in my country wanted to privatise all our national assets... power generation, telecommunications, even surveying. Their corporate masters wanted to take <em>our</em> wealth and use it for <em>their</em> benefit.</p>

<p>The people told them to fuck off. The left wing party won. But then they started doing exactly the same thing. This fucked us. Why? Because a large proportion of the public kept supporting that party simply because they were told it was the party that <em>wouldn&#39;t</em> do such things, and their &quot;loyalty&quot; meant they couldn&#39;t bring themselves to vote for someone else.</p>

<p>This meant that everything the right wing party tried to do was <em>actually</em> done by the left wing party. So of course the public voted them out... by voting for the right wing party that wanted to do the same damn thing.</p>

<p>Why did the people not vote for a different party that was genuinely opposed to the policies of both major parties? Because they were told no one else could win.</p>

<p>So we voted to fuck ourselves. We <em>asked</em> them to rape us, because we figured being raped was better than voting for the loser.</p>

<p>We did break the habit for awhile, and managed to change our electoral system to give smaller parties more say, but in the end the two major parties still held the power.</p>

<p>I tell you all this because you really need to be sure... are you voting for Sanders because he will be <em>right for the job</em>, or just because you think he&#39;ll be better than the other team&#39;s guy?</p>

<p>Have you looked at <em>all</em> the candidates, or just the ones that belong to the parties that the media tells you are the only ones with a chance of winning?</p>

<p>More the former - I am registered as an independent.  I truly don&#39;t give an ounce of shit what Party™ he belongs to.  I vote for Demos, Repubs and Indies in local and State elections.  I have voted both GOP &amp; DNC for POTUS in the past.  </p>

<p>i.e., It&#39;s not about party, for me.</p>

<p><strong>My Problem:</strong></p>

<p>I am unable to identify an &quot;ideal&quot; candidate -- running or not -- seriously, is there such a person -- an &quot;ideal&quot; ??  Maybe Shaq™?  Or James Bond™?  Possibly Wonder Woman™??  </p>

<p><strong>My Perspective:</strong></p>

<p>We ALWAYS need to set our sights on something that is &quot;realistic&quot; (i.e., within the paradigm) -- while never losing sight of the ideal.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a one or the other issue.</p>

<p>If we hold out for the ideal -- i.e., rejecting anything that isn&#39;t &quot;perfect&quot; (and therefor, missing small but valuable opportunities to advance):  What&#39;s the net effect?  Stagnation (i.e., &quot;status quo&quot;) i.e., who wins??  (Answer: &quot;They&quot; do.)</p>

<p><strong>We must take every opportunity to advance -- no matter how slight -- while we hold out for the ideal.</strong></p>

<p>Sanders is not my ideal.  I simply view Sanders to be the best chance to &quot;advance&quot;.</p>

<p>NOTE: I&#39;ll define &quot;advance&quot; as ... &quot;anything that checks/scores against zio (somewhat ironically)/banking/media/military complex, and puts more taxes into the hands of America citizens.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why did the people not vote for a different party that was genuinely opposed to the policies of both major parties? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, I believe it needs to be recognized ... are you talking about an &quot;ideal&quot; ??  </p>

<p>Because I know of know human being (apart from myself, of course) who would make an &quot;ideal&quot; POTUS.  How about you ?  Are you able to list an &quot;ideal candidate&quot; ?  Someone who is perfectly aligned / you on all policies?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because they were told no one else could win.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s a Catch-22.  I understand and recognize that.</p>

<p>I believe it&#39;s a matter of pushing as hard as you can for the ideal candidate... and then:</p>

<p><strong><em>On election day...</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>1.  if the masses are behind your &quot;write-in&quot; candidate (and you will know if they are -- there won&#39;t be any doubt), vote your heart.</strong></p>

<p><strong>2.  if the masses are NOT behind your ideal candidate (and you will know if they are not), it is simply quantifiably best (for you and your family) that you vote for the least piece of shit out of the two choices the system forces on you.</strong>  (you don&#39;t need to say &#39;thank you&#39; -- just stomach it.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>are you voting for Sanders because he will be right for the job, or just because you think he&#39;ll be better than the other team&#39;s guy?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>exactly... this is what i am getting at.</p>

<p>i need you to clarify... does &quot;right for the job&quot; == &quot;perfect&quot; ??</p>

<p>or does &quot;right for the job&quot; == &quot;better than anyone else -- ALL things considered -- INCLUDING odds of winning&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have you looked at all the candidates, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>of course not.  (that&#39;s a full time job for someone -- i can&#39;t afford that kind of time.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>or just the ones that belong to the parties that the media tells you are the only ones with a chance of winning?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am always going to support someone who has &quot;a chance&quot;.  <strong>The trick (and the key) is to force your candidate into the spotlight.</strong>  (Social media, included.)  That&#39;s the only way anyone will win... </p>

<p>Whether it&#39;s wagging the dog or actual reporting, one way or another, the popular candidate(s) will ALWAYS be covered by the mass media.  (Reporting is their job, frankly.)  </p>

<p>i.e., just because the media reports something, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s bad. ;)  sometimes the media is actually just reporting... we need to be smart enough to figure it out from story to story.  e.g., CNN is only evil 85% of the time ;)</p>

<p>EDIT/PS.  I don&#39;t really view the main stream media to be pushing Sanders so much:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/23/politics/cnn-orc-poll-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders/index.html">&quot;Hillary&#39;s lead over Bernie shrinks from +28 to +16 in one month. CNN&#39;s headline: &quot;Post-debate, voters move to Clinton&quot;&quot;</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s not about party, for me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good. It also means you&#39;re the enemy of the major parties and the hundreds of millions that support them regardless of what they actually do.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am unable to identify an &quot;ideal&quot; candidate</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nobody said they had to be &quot;ideal&quot;. All I asked you was have you considered candidates from other parties (or independents). If you have, and you think Sanders is the best man for the job. Then I encourage you to vote for him. I personally like Sanders too.</p>

<p>But too many people see elections as a sport. They want to support the winning team because it makes them feel like they are winners. They do not care if they are being lied to.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We ALWAYS need to set our sights on something that is &quot;realistic&quot; (i.e., within the paradigm) -- while never losing sight of the ideal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And there is the problem. How could a third party candidate <em>ever</em> be &quot;realistic&quot; if they are excluded right off the mark? A candidate is &quot;realistic&quot; if people are willing to vote for them. Period.</p>

<p>But the media fools you into thinking that they aren&#39;t &quot;realistic&quot; and thus ensures few people will vote for them. It is a &quot;self fulfilling prophecy&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If we hold out for the ideal -- i.e., rejecting anything that isn&#39;t &quot;perfect&quot; (and therefor, missing small but valuable opportunities to advance): What&#39;s the net effect? Stagnation (i.e., &quot;status quo&quot;) i.e., who wins?? (Answer: &quot;They&quot; do.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Only if the people accept that voting is the only power they have.</p>

<p>If only a million people actually got off their asses and marched on Washington, refusing to be intimidated into silence, and refusing to back down, the US could have it&#39;s own &quot;colour revolution&quot;.</p>

<p>The elites have no power. Period. The only power they have is to bribe us to persecute ourselves. Cops aren&#39;t billionaires. Soldier&#39;s aren&#39;t billionaires. But the cops and the soldiers protect the billionaires from everyone else.</p>

<p>Land of the free, home of the brave. Or is it?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Again, I believe it needs to be recognized ... are you talking about an &quot;ideal&quot; ??</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, I&#39;m talking about the fact that in my country (and yours) we had choices. Choices that would not continue the same policies, but because we said &quot;the lesser of two evils&quot; what we got was evil. Do you get what I mean? We chose to elect the people that we knew would do the exact opposite of what we wanted, simply because we thought the people who would do what we wanted couldn&#39;t win.</p>

<p>We fell for a scam. We were stupid. I&#39;m saying <em>do not follow our lead</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because I know of know human being (apart from myself, of course) who would make an &quot;ideal&quot; POTUS.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>No one</em> would make an ideal POTUS, especially <em>not</em> the people that say they would.</p>

<p>It is not about ideal. It is about electing your representatives. The US government is a representative republic. You are electing people to represent <em>you</em>. Do you want to be represented by &quot;the lesser of two evils&quot;, or by someone who actually reflects your values?</p>

<p>The more people that vote for the &quot;lesser of two evils&quot; the less any of you are <em>actually</em> represented.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(you don&#39;t need to say &#39;thank you&#39; -- just stomach it.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that&#39;s why the minority whites were able to enslave the majority in just about every country they colonised. As long as the slaves &quot;stomach&quot; it, slavery continues.</p>

<p>If your vote doesn&#39;t count, if you end up enslaved anyway, why play their game? If as many people that said they were voting for the lesser of two evils actually did something direct, the slavery would be over in weeks. The elites would flee the country out of fear of the <em>real</em> power in the US - the people.</p>

<p>No revolution starts with 100% public support. It starts with only a small portion of brave people willing to put their ass on the line to <em>make</em> the system change.</p>

<p>Remember, the US would still be a Commonwealth state ruled by the British Monarch if it wasn&#39;t for a small number of brave people. The Founding Fathers would be disgusted at the cowardice displayed by the people they thought they had freed from oppression.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>or does &quot;right for the job&quot; == &quot;better than anyone else -- ALL things considered -- INCLUDING odds of winning&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Put simply, you are handing your vote to someone else and saying &quot;I&#39;m not smart enough to select the right person for the job, you vote for me.&quot;.</p>

<p>When you fall for the lie that a candidate is &quot;unelectable&quot;, you are letting the people who tell you that, cast your vote for you.</p>

<p>My nation got royally fucked by doing the same thing. I&#39;m just saying &quot;don&#39;t let it happen to you <em>again</em>.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;ll finish by saying this: Do not take this as a criticism of <em>your</em> choice. My comments are directed as much to the passive readers as to the people I reply to. </p>

<p>All I am saying is: <em>are you really voting for Sanders, or just voting against the other guy?</em></p>

<p>If you <em>are</em> voting for Sanders because you think he is the best man for the job (of <em>all</em> the available candidates), then none of my criticisms are directed at you.</p>

<p>The paradigm is useful, but only if we do not let it prevent both sides from seeing where the real problem lies.</p>

<p>The power elites are not &quot;left&quot; or &quot;right&quot;, but they use both against <em>us</em>. To them, they are just labels. They are only concepts to be used to manipulate public opinion.</p>

<p>But without the power elites, there is a real reason for having that paradigm. Think of it like the &quot;angel and the devil sitting on your shoulder&quot;. They are meant to oppose each other so that <em>people</em> can find the balance that benefits them the most.</p>

<p>But instead they have been used to divide and conquer us so that we never get what <em>we</em> want.</p>

<p>I agree, but it is not the left which has done it. Clearly it isn&#39;t, because the left doesn&#39;t even exist in America. The GOP are hardball lunatics and the Dems are only ever as far to the left as they need to be in order to make themselves seem like the better option.</p>

<p>I would argue the American left is even more to blame. People expect the right wing part to be right wing, but the left wing party sold out. The Democrats would not even exist any more if left wing people stopped supporting and voting for the no longer left wing party.</p>

<p>Wow... a hundred million people were murdered? News to me.</p>

<p>You seem to think I am talking about political parties that claim to be left wing. I&#39;m not. I&#39;m talking about the hundreds of millions of people that are <em>actually</em> left wing.</p>

<p>Did you know that if you take away all the political-speak and simply present left wing policies to people as an idea, the majority of Americans support <em>all</em> the major left wing policies?</p>

<p>It is only once those policies are described as being socialist or communist that many Americans vote against their own beliefs.</p>

<p>The left still exists because humans are social animals, and left wing policies simply reflect that reality. The problem is they are not being promoted by the &quot;viable candidates&quot;, so people allow themselves to be tricked into voting against them.</p>

<p>This is a great post, and there is a lot of truth to it. It is however crippled by the lack of acknowledgment that the elites are genuine right wingers. They aren&#39;t pretending about that. You are right that they fund both sides, but the other side is the false left, not the genuine left. They have destroyed the genuine left. They spent nigh on 40 years attacking it on a daily basis in the press with much the same tactics that they now use against the people who have woken up to them in the internet age. That is, they created a stigma about being on the left just like they have created a stigma about being a Conspiracy Theorist. They used propaganda and smear to sell the idea to people that being a Communist was a terrible thing.</p>

<p>And resultantly, they shifted the entire platform of American politics to the right.</p>

<p>Of course. I never said otherwise. However, was the existing system set up by the average Joe in the streets, or by the elite? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>When the poor suffer and pay to support the rich, then that isn&#39;t socialism. It is capitalism. It is the outright definition of capitalism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once again, I never said otherwise. However, when the people <em>pay taxes</em> to bail out the wealthy, that&#39;s socialism. The capitalists would rather none of us be taxed, because that leaves more wealth available for them to steal.</p>

<p>They want to take our money for themselves, not for the betterment of all society. But the best they can do at the moment is make sure we pay the taxes, while they take the benefits. We still get something back for our money, but the capitalist &quot;capos&quot; skim a sizable portion off the top.</p>

<p>In principal, capitalists are far right wing. In practice, they are forced to be socialists.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>To bastardise a child&#39;s rhyme &quot;sticks and stones may break my bones, but it&#39;s how I vote that hurts me&quot;.</p>

<p>The only reason the propaganda worked is because the left chose to let it work. They chose to join the &quot;socialism is evil&quot; bandwagon. If the political left is dead, it&#39;s because it committed suicide. </p>

<p>Not at all. The native American culture is alive and well. It is just marginalised and ignored.</p>

<p>I understand what you are saying, and you are right. But I&#39;m trying to point out to you that they never had power to do anything but ask us to kill ourselves. They could not <em>force</em> us to vote against our own interests. They could not <em>force</em> us to swallow their lies.</p>

<p>They have promoted the neoliberal model of free market rationalisation deregulation tax cutting etc and convinced people to support policies that roll back government taxes and regulations on their wealth and power. The shift of the tax base, promoted as as reducing crushing guvmit thieving taxes on you places the burden on you and reduces taxes on them. They want government insofar as it protects themselves. What they advocate is not honestly implemented from top to bottom. If it were everything would come crashing down as the awful neoliberal system we have today would be accelerated x100 fold. What they advocate is partly implemented on everyone else in a way that benefits themselves enormously - whether they know this and are hypocrites, are blinded craven fools, or psychopaths is an interesting question.</p>

<p>They fund both <em>factions</em> of the Business Party. The Democrats are the less extreme faction of the Business Party. The Democrats are not the left.

<p>Well, for a start, those people are the lowest level of the elites. None of us know the names of the true elite because they are never printed in Forbes&#39; &#39;rich list&#39;, they are rarely mentioned in the media at all. Bill Gates top&#39;s the Forbes rich list with only $79 billion. Where are the arms dealers?</p>

<p>Where are the royals and the aristocrats that owned most of the world before socialism started turning people against them? The British Queen owns 6.6 billion acres of land in 34 countries, including the US. That land is worth a hell of a lot more than $15 an acre. So why isn&#39;t she top of the list? And there are others that make <em>her</em> look middle class.</p>

<p>All of them are perfectly happy to socialise the costs. The British Queen is one of the wealthiest people on the planet. But she pays no taxes. In fact the government pays her for her &quot;services&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The British Royal Family is financed mainly by public money. The British Parliament meets the cost of the Sovereign&#39;s official expenditure from public funds. This includes the costs of the upkeep of the various royal residences, staffing, travel and state visits, public engagements, and official entertainment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finances_of_the_British_Royal_Family">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finances_of_the_British_Royal_Family</a></p>

<p>The British Queen receives more &quot;benefits&quot; than any &quot;welfare queen&quot;. But I do not see the Conservatives talking about &quot;nanny state&quot; when it comes to <em>her</em> publicly funded lifestyle.</p>

<blockquote>
