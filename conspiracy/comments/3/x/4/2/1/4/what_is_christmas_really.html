But when we think about it what are toys?  Parents give their children toys to be distracted with so that the parents can then go and be distracted with something else they think is more important than spending quality time with their children.  We consider a child to be &quot;good&quot; when they do not show any discontentment towards the idiot parents neglect.  I find this to be the crux of all the worlds problems, the substitution of things over relationships.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re aware that parents can play with their children with those toys, right? Imaginative, independent play is very important for development and if parents didn&#39;t buy them toys, they&#39;d still play with sticks and rocks and other stuff. Holidays should be primarily about family. I don&#39;t know how you were raised, but calm yourself. If you want to get crotchety about parents neglecting their children for material gain, have an issue with the North American work week.</p>
