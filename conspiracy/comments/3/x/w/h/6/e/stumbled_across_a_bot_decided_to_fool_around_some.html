        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Removed due to serious privacy concern exposed by this bot</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>there is a bot, who will not be named, that posts every 10 minutes a string of seemingly nonsense sentences. this was shown to me by a friend on skype. as a joke, my friends and i decided to google image search the phrases it posted. you know some HL3 confirmed shit, for lulz <em>and making fun of you guys</em>. what we came across was weird images, bible passages and then disturbingly, images that showed private account information for various linked-in users.</p>

<p>due to the ethics of this situation, i have notified linked-in support and i am documenting this situation as it develops.</p>

<p>to answer questions i can see myself being asked:</p>

<p><strong>will you post screenshots, do you have screenshots?</strong> yes i have screenshots, no they will not be posted without censorship due to the sensitive nature of the documents. this is to protect the privacy of the accounts in question.</p>

<p><strong>Will you name the bot again?</strong> Not until this is resolved, due to the above situation. unless you saw the name before i censored it, you will not see the name until it has been dealt with. if you know the name of the bot PLEASE do not post the name of the bot.</p>

<p><strong>Why do you think its a bot?</strong> it posts EXACTLY every 10 minutes to a random sub. that seems like a bot, and is what i&#39;m going off of when i call it a bot.</p>

<p>Censored files. do not request the white boxes be removed, due to the nature of what is being censored.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2: sterilized links</strong> for your interest. will crosspost to linkedin. any other ideas where i should post this?</p>

<p>The image as it shows on google image search using one of the bots random phrases as a search query. the actual image is censored due to contents, and theres really nothing of the image that can be allowed to be seen given the circumstances (namely its marked as private on the slide-share site): <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/op0ps6znouagqsk/safe%201.jpg?dl=0">https://www.dropbox.com/s/op0ps6znouagqsk/safe%201.jpg?dl=0</a></p>

<p>clicking the <em>visit page, or view image</em> link and being redirected. as what should be happening:

<p>Part one of the form i filled out to linked-in, regarding the issue. i&#39;ve left out the bot as...what do i even say about the bot? how the fuck do i talk about the bot without seeming like a nutcase?

<p><strong>Update 3: Bots dead</strong></p>

<p>well, bots deleted.</p>

<p><strong>update 4: Example</strong>
as the bot is dead. i think i can share an example with another phrase, i know this one leads to im guessing a 50 shades of grey copy someone has on their account.</p>

<p>i dont know. it looks like a page from a book but it will prove my point.</p>

<p>here is a phrase as it appears in the account before deletion
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/r8i6ogih6wk5bqa/ss1.png?dl=0">https://www.dropbox.com/s/r8i6ogih6wk5bqa/ss1.png?dl=0</a></p>

<p>here is me google searching part of the phrase, using google images
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/uqsrcaojdn8hr04/ss2.png?dl=0">https://www.dropbox.com/s/uqsrcaojdn8hr04/ss2.png?dl=0</a></p>

<p>Here is me scrolling down about a page till i find a image from <em>slideshare.net</em> looks like 50shadesofgrey about section, still legible.
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/a0stp971kt66yj2/ss3.png?dl=0">https://www.dropbox.com/s/a0stp971kt66yj2/ss3.png?dl=0</a></p>

<p>here is me hovering my mouse over the visit page button to see what happens. note the url the link points at.
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/g38m6z6qaxpzuy7/ss4.png?dl=0">https://www.dropbox.com/s/g38m6z6qaxpzuy7/ss4.png?dl=0</a></p>

<p>here is me following that link, and getting redirected. which is how it should work. that works fine. point is, i still could READ the image without authorization, using nothing more then google.
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/630il7odh0ucwby/ss5.png?dl=0">https://www.dropbox.com/s/630il7odh0ucwby/ss5.png?dl=0</a></p>

<p>point is these users think that they are protecting themselves, when they are not. no ones going to get hurt by a <em>about the author</em> page but the account holder still marked it as private on slideshare.net which SHOULD mean that you cant see it unless your THAT account holder. </p>

<p><strong>update</strong>
Issue perhaps resolved.</p>

<p>The claim they state is that at one point the files in question were marked as public. While being public, they got indexed and cached. At a later time, the file was then marked private. Due to the nature of Google&#39;s indexing procedures, the cached image will appear in a Google search for some time.</p>

<p>So it seems to me, that they are saying it is the users responsibility to correctly mark the file as private upon upload should there be sensitive information on it. It sounds reasonable and makes sense after all. If it starts public, it can be indexed and if it&#39;s moved to private after a while, there&#39;s nothing really to remove retroactively the fact it got indexed in the first place.</p>

<p>I feel satisfied with this answer. Does it mesh for you guys?</p>

<p>looks to me like its designed to discredit anti-vaxxers - if you thought that bot was a real person, you would think them a very strange person indeed .. and generalize that opinion to other (human) anti-vaccine people</p>

<p>edit: not a big deal for just one bot, but imagine thousands or even millions of these things running all over the internet disrupting conversations about vaccines and autism. </p>

<p>wonder if theres a way to trace their source - i guess somebody could setup a honeypot</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i am currently in discussion with linked-in to resolve a data breach that this exposed. i was able to see personal files that were marked as private locally on the site. this was done using a simple google image search using terms that the bot in question posted.</p>

<p>i have screenshots to support this. ethically i can not share here uncensored of course. however, i am sterilizing any personally identifying information, URLs or anything remotely able to identify me, or the poor person who owns that linked-in acount in question. i hope i don&#39;t have to go to the news but i might as well warn people here on reddit who might be using linked-in. im not expecting linked-in not to cooperate, but just in case i documented the shit out of it due to the fact i was able to see a image marked as <em>private</em> on linked-ins site</p>

<p>i really wasn&#39;t expecting this to happen, i was just fooling around and lo and behold i&#39;m looking at someone&#39;s fricking bankinfo....</p>

<p>i honestly don&#39;t know what to do here. i got in touch with linked-in. should i report the shit out of the bot? or is it just some weird cosmic coincidence?</p>

<p>give me...maybe an hour. i would very much like not to get sued for missing something </p>

    <div class="md"><p>it appeared to be a scanned form. DOB, SS#, address, Bank info for direct deposit. i did not get into the account proper. i DID see the image file however. upon clicking the <em>view image</em> i was brought to <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/b34mcv4ofdfp2e3/safe%202.png?dl=0">https://www.dropbox.com/s/b34mcv4ofdfp2e3/safe%202.png?dl=0</a></p>

<p>which clearly means that that form was not intended for public eyes.</p>

<p>as the bot is dead. i think i can share an example with another phrase, i know this one leads to im guessing a 50 shades of grey copy someone has on their account.</p>

<p>i dont know. it looks like a page from a book but it will prove my point.</p>

<p>here is a phrase as it appears in the account before deletion

<p>here is me google searching part of the phrase, using google images

<p>Here is me scrolling down about a page till i find a image from <em>slideshare.net</em> looks like 50shadesofgrey about section, still legible.

<p>here is me hovering my mouse over the visit page button to see what happens. note the url the link points at.

<p>here is me following that link, and getting redirected. which is how it should work. that works fine. point is, i still could READ the image without authorization, using nothing more then google.

<p>point is these users think that they are protecting themselves, when they are not. no ones going to get hurt by a <em>about the author</em> page but the account holder still marked it as private on slideshare.net which SHOULD mean that you cant see it unless your THAT account holder. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>bot was deleted, and if you are so interested in proof. name me a way that i havent already done that</p>

<p>1) prevents me from geting my pants sued off for sharing private information </p>

<p>2) does not expose any sort of information that could lead to identity theft</p>

<p>3) satisfies you</p>

<p>because if i can post a phrase that would give you a ..somewhat blurry but still readable image of what seems to be excerpts from a novel. as posted on an account that wants said post private. i could do that. im not going to post fricking SS#s or give you the phrase that shows you the SS#s thats retarded.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could be but it makes me wonder. Why not just say this profile has been deleted or doesn&#39;t exist. I guess I&#39;m just thinking that somehow the bot has access to things in Reddit it shouldn&#39;t have. Wouldn&#39;t be all that surprising with all the censorship lately. Somebody is paying money to somebody to make sure certain things are buried.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do we need any more tangible proof about Google&#39;s information trawling capability on behalf of the NSA?</p>

<p>Not that any of us should really be surprised but I can promise you that what you search for on Google images is a fraction of what content is gleaned from the internet and all services attached to it that is available to the spooks. </p>

<p>Remember backdoors are such a good idea for everyone right? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Issue perhaps resolved.</p>

<p>The claim they state is that at one point the files in question were marked as public. While being public, they got indexed and cached. At a later time, the file was then marked private. Due to the nature of Google&#39;s indexing procedures, the cached image will appear in a Google search for some time.</p>

<p>So it seems to me, that they are saying it is the users responsibility to correctly mark the file as private upon upload should there be sensitive information on it. It sounds reasonable and makes sense after all. If it starts public, it can be indexed and if it&#39;s moved to private after a while, there&#39;s nothing really to remove retroactively the fact it got indexed in the first place.</p>

<p>I feel satisfied with this answer. Does it mesh for you guys?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Meh.. bit of a cop out excuse because if you are logged in securely all your data you upload should also be secure by default. That they mark it public at all is broken.</p>

<p>So no sorry don&#39;t buy it and also don&#39;t think it is an isolate practice either. I mean it is not like linked-in is not <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/2609621/hacking/uk-spy-agency-uses-nsa-attack-to-hack-slashdot--linkedin-users.html">already a target anyway.</a></p>
