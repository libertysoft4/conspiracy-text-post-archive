    <div class="md"><p>Good job I haven&#39;t mentioned gun violence then (y) And what are you talking about? Assault Rifle is a well defined term referring to a rifle capable of selective fire, typically including automatic action, with a detachable magazine. I think I have made my point fairly clearly that the US is quite the anomaly (especially in &#39;The West&#39;) when it comes to allowing access to such weapons as part of the general civilian arsenal.    </p>

<p>So please tell me how banning legal assault rifles which have almost never been used in criminal violence is going to have any impact on gun violence?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the problem is that there are two separate issues. General gun violence and mass shootings. I agree that banning assault weapons is unlikely to greatly reduce gun violence in the US as the country is flooded with weapons already and as you rightly point out the majority of violence is an attritional process with a multitude of small events using smaller-sized weapons such as handguns etc. This is why I do try to take a wider holistic view of gun control in the US but also why I try to stay away from discussing it (unless drawn into it as I have here haha) as I understand it is very much a cultural issue that I will never understand as an outsider. </p>

<p>Now the issue of mass-shooting is what draws attention so this is where most of the media and political pressure ends up being applied. Again you&#39;re right that the majority of massacres are actually conducted using semi-auto weapons that would not be affected by banning assault weapons. This doesn&#39;t matter though. Do you honestly expect the media and government to put forwards a rational response to such an emotional topic? Ultimately assault weapons are <em>perceived</em> (i.e. your own opinion/factual reality is less important here) to be the more dangerous. They are <em>seen</em> as having a high rate of fire, are easy to rapidly reload, and can general cause an awful lot of destruction in fairly short order.</p>

<p>Anyway I&#39;m done with guns for now I can see this is evidently pricking a lot of people. I will leave <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rR9IaXH1M0">Jim</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9UFyNy-rw4">Jefferies</a> excellent sketch on gun control though as it covers most of the points that I would normally raise in such an argument, plus the guy is pretty funny :) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes and when buying personal ammunition citizens must provide identification, proof of address, and criminal background check. They are then permitted to buy ammunition for guns they are <em>legally allowed to own</em>. Ammunition for the militia rifles that are privately owned is limited to government-approved shooting ranges and must be used on site. Why do people argue this so much? Is it not just common sense that it&#39;s a good idea to have some regulations and restrictions on the purchasing and use of deadly weapons? </p>

<p>There is no populist logic behind the idea that a militaristic state should wield much more powerful weapons than its citizens.  It serves only to prevent revolution should an authoritarian oligarchy run off the rails.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess I underestimated just how unpopular Hillary is on this sub.  I never said I think she would be great.  I thought I made it pretty clear I&#39;m not overly fond of her, and you&#39;re making me out to be a Hillary supporter.  Maybe not you specifically but that one guy sure is.</p>

<p>On the same token, I think you underestimate just how much I can&#39;t stand most of the candidates on the right.  Carson&#39;s an idiot savant, Fiorina&#39;s more of a liar than Hillary, and Bush is well, Bush.  As a New Jersey native I can tell you Christie is petty and vindictive and overly arrogant, and Rand Paul is a pompous ass who I&#39;ll never forgive for his response to Hurricane Sandy.  I mean I&#39;ve met rabid Star Wars fans that like Jar Jar more than I like Trump or Cruz.</p>

<p>Rubio&#39;s the only Republican that has any chance that I would consider voting for, and even he is, at best, just as phony as Clinton.  </p>

<p>So yes, I would be willing to cast a vote for Clinton if it means keeping someone I see as even worse out of the White House.  Please don&#39;t make me out to be a Clinton supporter.  I&#39;m not.  I just happen to think the other side is a hell of a lot worse.  Hopefully Sanders gets the nomination and I don&#39;t have to bite the bullet.  As it stands, he&#39;s the only candidate I think positively of.  Period. </p>

<p>Underneath the surface, Diebold voting machines are unauditable and unaccountable. I would truly find it more surprising if these machines are <em>not</em> being exploited by power brokers to position their favored candidates. This is simple human nature.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a pretty big leap of logic you just made.  I do think that corruption exists within the government and I do think they&#39;re largely incompetent.  I just don&#39;t need to believe in conspiracies to see that.</p>

<p>I think an example would better illustrate what I mean.  There are some who believe 9/11 was an inside job.  I personally don&#39;t think the evidence holds up all that well, but I do think our government took advantage of the fear that came with it to convince the populace we should go to war in Iraq.  The biggest difference between you and I is that you think the government causes a lot of these events whereas I think they simply take advantage of these events.</p>

<p>Besides, they&#39;d have to be pretty damn competent to keep so many conspiracies under wrap for so long.</p>

<p>We know for a fact the bureaucratic parts are shitty. Your local DMV is probably a hellhole of barely competent people working at a snails pace. Similar with other federal agencies, like TSA and DHS.</p>

<p>Now we also know several black projects go on with utmost secrecy. The U-2 spy plane was one such project. Did it get leaked before by all the people working on it?</p>

<p>There&#39;s countless shit in Groom Lake that we will never know the details of. Has anything leaked there? So clearly the government can keep secrets if they want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sanders is a strawman candidate, brought in to give the impression that it isn&#39;t a coronation. Except that Clintons numbers have tanked and Sanders could actually take it. Now the Democratic Party and the MSM has to maneuver the situation to where it could be plausible for Clinton to take it. </p>

<p>Quite the pickle for them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh. Some of that was Bernie being genuinely respectful for his wife, and acknowledging how the role of First Lady has changed since Hillary held that position. </p>

<p>What was ridiculous was Muir allowing Clinton to have the last word for literally everything. Allowing Clinton to talk over the moderators without interruption, yet Sanders got shut down when he would try to reply at times. Clinton positioned at center. Clinton allowed to walk in late, during a question, and somehow it&#39;s treated as funny and not disrespectful. This debate showed obvious favoritism towards Hilary. It sucks, but she&#39;s got the support already. </p>

<p>She opposed LGBT rights, including same-sex marriage and civil unions. When voting against legalizing civil unions, she stated: &quot;To try to act as if there is a difference between &#39;civil unions&#39; and same-sex marriage is dishonest, cowardly and extremely disrespectful to the people of Hawaii who have already made overwhelmingly clear our position on this issue.... <strong>As Democrats we should be representing the views of the people, not a small number of homosexual extremists.</strong>&quot; In August 2004, <strong>she defended her then-Republican father&#39;s anti-LGBT work, and called supporters of U.S. Congressman Ed Case &quot;homosexual extremists</strong>&quot;.[20][21]</p>
