Man why don&#39;t you focus on 1 thing and give us evidence on that.... Once you prove your point on one thing then you can go onto something else...... OH wait you can&#39;t provide any proof so you have to jump around to different topics/subjects to keep the idea alive in your head... what you did in your head was give proof of something.... Truth no you didn&#39;t. Maybe stop lying to yourself, Maybe you have an imbalance in brain chemistry, IDK I&#39;m not a doctor(but i play one on TV) Advice: try sticking to one thing and prove that. You will atleast seem credible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok let&#39;s stick to hollow earth. I&#39;ll try to do the &#39;explain like I&#39;m five&#39; because that&#39;s your intelligence compared to mine. If I jump up and down I&#39;m creating energy, if the earth was filled that energy would balk at the ground. This obviously doesn&#39;t happen, though you might now have realized it with your limited knowledge. Other people can feel the prosaic energy of a group of people stomping, basically proving my point. 
Also check out my earth worm example,though it may too complex for such a simple mind who probably doesn&#39;t know what oxygen is(it&#39;s a gaseous odorous chemical that is part of the periodic table of element that air is made of) 
You are indubitably and vocariously being hostile towards my bucolic argument for what sake? You bring no non fallacy ridden argument only ad hominem and ad hoc post. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe you try to disprove me, but you can&#39;t. I scored a 1420 on the SAT&#39;s and got a 29 on my ACT&#39;s last year. I&#39;m smarter than you and that makes you angry. Your clandestine jabs have no semblance to actual arguing or rational thought. I would personally test your frontal lobe and gray matter levels to see why you can&#39;t think logically. The government has probably reduced the size of your frontal lobe a large deal. My frontal lobe is 13.6 inches across, well above average. Einstein&#39;s was only 12.1 inches across. Unless you want to see some intellectual beat down of your pathetic mind I think you should stop with your ad hominem and actually debate me with facts and logic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Common sense refutes you. The idea was yours the burden of proof is on you! I&#39;m willing to listen to all the proof you can provide. But you refuse to provide any instead you launch into how smart you are and how big your brain is...... Oh snap maybe that whats going on here your brain is inflamed causing extra pressure in your cranium. That&#39;s why your not understanding what actually proof  of your though is.

    <div class="md"><p>Kind Sir I resent your irrational discourse. I will now fully prove my point. 
John Quincy Adams sent an expedition to prove the earth was hollow in 1816. None of the men on the mission ever came back. These men obviously fell through. And what happend 2 days after these men left? John Quincy Adams was shot and killed by a &#39;communist&#39; which was obviously a ploy to cover it all up. Reagan suggested the same thing in 1996, what happens two weeks later? He was said to have Alzheimer&#39;s, though they obviously just cut out a part of his frontal lobe. 
Next well go on to the scientific persons. Blaise Pascal suggested the earth was flat in 1665, he was proclaimed crazy in 1666 that can&#39;t be a coincidence. Linus Pauling suggested the same in 1972, he lost his position in the scientific community after,that can&#39;t be a coincidence.
Now how about an extremely basic proof? Skyscrapers wouldn&#39;t exist in a filled earth. Lava would seep through due to emmense pressure from these structures. Why does lava not seep through? Because the earth is hollow and lava isn&#39;t real. The government has tried to convince us it is, why? I don&#39;t know. That&#39;s why it&#39;s a conspiracy on the best goddamn sub in the world <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. So now I plead, do you have any counter argument at all that isn&#39;t ad hominem post hoc? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I await your evidence.... Jumping to conclusions is not evidence. Stating &quot;obviously&quot; after you have tried to make a point doesn&#39;t prove anything. I would think that someone with such a massive intellect would be able to point to specific examples as proof not make a statement and tag on obviously and think of that as proof.....   LOL  yea skyscrapers don&#39;t sit on hard stone(granite) as a base and we all know how porous granite is... The crust of the earth isn&#39;t miles deep
