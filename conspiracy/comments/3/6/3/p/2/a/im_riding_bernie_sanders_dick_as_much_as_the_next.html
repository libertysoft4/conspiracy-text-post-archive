<p>Which means that no presidential candidate will be an ally of the rest of the <em>non</em>-Zionist human race.  Are you understanding this?  I mean...there&#39;s really no way around that.  If you support Zionism, then you are an enemy of the rest of humanity.  It’s as simple as that.</p>

<p>So you know all this, and yet you&#39;re <em>still</em> advocating siding with this motherfucker?  Seriously?  Dude, the system is corrupt beyond repair, so siding with this &quot;least of all evils” charlatan will do absolutely nothing but continue to perpetuate the same manipulative bullshit that has continued for I don&#39;t know how long now in this country.  Perhaps since its inception.</p>

<p>Oh absolutely it doesn&#39;t.  Agreed.  Hell, the more he&#39;s talked about, the more it can be seen that he&#39;s NOT what he appears to be or markets himself as being.  Therefore, I agree with you.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not advocating siding with him. I&#39;m advocating telling people, that if they are going to vote, at least vote for sanders, kinda like upvote for visibility kind of thing, except for the issues.</p>

<p>I&#39;d love to (and have tried) explaining the whole zionist running the show thing to friends and family, but 90% of people just don&#39;t want to hear it and have their heads stuck in the sand. Advocating sanders to these people is better than nothing. </p>

<p>You should consider that not one candidate stands a chance of any airtime if they are critical of israel. Not one. And I don&#39;t even mean winning the election, I mean the MSM not bashing their faces into the ground so to speak. So far sanders doesn&#39;t have much that the MSM can throw at him, criticizing israel is the only thing that could bring him down. It is possible he knows he can&#39;t win and actually is an enemy of zionism but has to play their game on that ONE issue simply to bring the issues to more people and have more visibility.</p>

<p>I advocate people don&#39;t vote, but if they&#39;re going to vote, vote for either some independent, green party candidate...or for their mom or something.  Put &quot;my mom&quot; on the ballot and vote for that.</p>

<p>Yes.  This is indeed how it really seems to be to a great extent, unfortunately.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Sanders is a Cheshire Cat Pied Piper, man.  100%.  He is <em>not</em> the way to go.  He is the drug you take to try to blind yourself to how bad things are - which ends up ensuring that you stay in the shit hole even longer...instead of <em>refusing</em> to take anything to blind yourself, staying <em>wide the fuck AWAKE</em>, and seeing the horrible problems going on for what they really and truly are.  THAT is what will help you get <em>out</em> of the shitty situation you&#39;re in - not trying to go with some &quot;lesser evil pied piper&quot; that TPTB likely primed specifically to distract the masses into believing that there is &quot;a way out!&quot;</p>

<p>Denial will <em>never</em> work.  It will just <em>always</em> make things worse.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>Yes.  I understand this.  I think voting would count if EVERYONE did it <em>and</em> the system weren’t 100% rigged.  Unfortunately, the system <em>is</em> almost entirely rigged and, for this reason, many people simply don’t vote.  I’m a university-educated middle aged adult and haven’t voted a day in my life.</p>

<p>I feel we&#39;re really past the point where the “slow and gradual” approach is the one that should be taken in areas such as this one.  I feel that if the choice is between A) telling people that someone like Bernie Sanders is likely nothing more than controlled opposition, and B) letting them go on ahead and happily voting for him as they continue thinking that they’re making some big difference toward “change!” like they did when they foolishly voted for Obama in his first (and second) term, then I would just as soon chose A over B 10 out of 10 times.</p>

<p>This is a hard pill to swallow, yes, but we’re REALLY fucking sick as a nation and as a people at this point, so I don’t think we can or should afford to NOT step up our critical thinking game.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Agree with this.  However, I don’t feel the solution is getting on the Bernie Sanders bandwagon.  Fuck the “if you can’t beat them, join them” philosophy.  That doesn’t work.  Be as LITTLE an accomplice in the system of corruption we live in as possible.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is part of the reason why I don’t have really any friends.  Perhaps.  If so, however, then so be it.  I would rather be alone than surrounded by those who think things I feel are entirely mistaken.</p>

<p>That’s not a horrible philosophy, to be honest, and I don’t think it is entirely invalid, if invalid at all.  I do feel it is a bit dangerous, however, because - again - Sanders is little more than controlled opposition…just like Obama always was and is.  It’s all pied piper bullshit.  Hell, I personally don’t advocate voting even third party.  I advocate being aware that the entire system is bullshit to the extent that it’s made voting almost entirely a <a href="http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8jv618r6h1qfvq9bo1_500.jpg">sham</a>.</p>

<p>I think the entire pit should be burned, however.</p>

<p>What we need if for all of us as citizens to just put away all the racism and separatist ignorance that has been brain wahsed and indoctrinated into us.  If we all come together as the one people, species, and race that we indeed truly are and work together to help each other independent of the enslaving fiat currency paradigm we live under, then we wouldn&#39;t have all the problems that we do.</p>

<p><em>No one</em> - no candidate, president, etc - will be able to help or change a single thing so long as they keep working under the present system as it stands.  It&#39;s the SYSTEM that is corrupt and putrid - not just the candidates.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well to be honest he actually seems like a decent candidate, and stands for all the civil rights stuff reddit loves like no NSA spying, no War, gay rights, abortion, etc. etc. So it shouldn&#39;t really come as any surprise.</p>

<p>They were loving on hillary till sanders announced his candidacy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can personally admit that ive been pimping bernie sanders to reddit for a long while now and I&#39;m no shill.  Feel free to look through my comments.  He&#39;s worth it.  Propaganda doesn&#39;t always equal bad.  Plus the guy isn&#39;t going to pay for someone to spread the word he&#39;s doing it himself.  He posts on reddit fairly often.  I truly believe most if not all of the posts you see daily are from genuine users.  </p>
