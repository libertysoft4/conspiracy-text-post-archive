<blockquote>
<p>By now, vaccine skeptics are generally familiar with the faces of Congressmen who are attempting to take away their natural rights to determine whether or not they and their children are vaccinated. </p>

<p>Congressional parasites like Dianne Feinstein, as well as Presidential hopefuls like Hillary Clinton and Ben Carson, are now regular appearances in the “remove parents’ rights” theatre.</p>

<p>But how many people are familiar with the faces of the state level sycophants that are attempting to eliminate basic human rights? After all, there have been a number of state level attacks against parents and children in recent months. </p>

<p>What about the State Senators and Representatives who have accepted money from Big Pharma at the expense of their constituents or are simply trendy fanatics by nature?</p>

<p><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vGsInAbe2zo/VV_Xb_6moPI/AAAAAAAAGeU/_oFS00UcPEQ/s1600/tarte.jpg">Ladies and gentlemen, I give you NC State Senator Jeff Tarte.</a></p>

<p>As if his last name did not accurately describe his disposition, Senator Tarte was one of the main sponsors of the <a href="http://www.wral.com/nc-vaccine-bill-dead/14554219/">NC bill SB 346</a>, a bill that would have eliminated the “religious exemption” clause in the recommended vaccine schedule for children entering NC public schools. </p>

<p>He was also a main contender for the title of worst public relations interaction with a constituent in the state of North Carolina in the last several years.</p>

<p>This interaction took place after activists Nicole Revels and Pattie Curran arrived in Raleigh to hand petitions containing nearly 3000 signatures of NC residents who did not want their rights removed to NC congressmen and congresswomen who were attempting to do just that.</p>

<p>After handing in a copy of the petition to Senator Tamara Barringer and receiving a very pleasant, albeit patronizing and completely phony response that she was “listening” to them, all parties shook hands and the activists moved on to Tarte’s office.</p>

<p>Upon arriving at Tarte’s office, the Senator became irate at the sight of the two activists and Revels in particular. Already engaged in a discussion of the bill, Tarte immediately began whining about the presence of cameras and, in particular, the presence of Nicole Revels, stating that he was going to “get the Sgt. In Arms” to remove them.</p>

<p><a href="http://dailyhaymaker.com/?p=10924">Visibly irritated</a> at being confronted by anyone other than a fawning worshiper or someone taking his order, Tarte could scarcely cover up the look of disgust at being asked a legitimate question about a bill he was sponsoring. </p>

<p>When asked if he was going to remove the religious exemption from accessibility to NC parents, Tarte simply responded “Yes.”</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter, Tarte indeed found the Sgt. In Arms and had Revels and Curran removed.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Oejvw_yX0">The confrontation can be seen in this video</a>. Tarte’s appearance is around the 6:53 mark.</p>

<p><a href="http://vaccinefactcheck.org/2015/04/02/north-carolina-becomes-3rd-state-to-reject-stricter-mandatory-vaccination-laws/">While the bill was ultimately defeated</a> due to the work of activists like Curran and Revels and large numbers of NC parents who valued the natural human rights, the issue very much remains alive. </p>

<p>Vaccine pushers, fanatics, along with those Congressional money vessels who have been purchased by Big Pharma dollars will no doubt return with another version of the bill or insert it as a rider or last minute amendment to a larger bill that will be politically difficult to vote against.</p>

<p>Mandatory vaccination is allowing the ruling class to dictate our very own, individual biology. The very same class that has refered to us as &quot;useless eaters&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>I remember a few months back, there was a big uproar when Kenyan doctors announced they found the anti-fertility HCG antigen in the tetanus vaccine the UN provided.</p>

<p><a href="http://healthimpactnews.com/2014/mass-sterilization-kenyan-doctors-find-anti-fertility-agent-in-un-tetanus-vaccine/">http://healthimpactnews.com/2014/mass-sterilization-kenyan-doctors-find-anti-fertility-agent-in-un-tetanus-vaccine/</a></p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if this is true. I&#39;d imagine the rising population in African countries has got the UN worried. It would be so easy for them to slow down population growth there by slipping a little anti-fertility drug into their life saving vaccines.</p>

<p>What has me worried is that this could so easily be done in first world countries. If a depopulation strategy does happen (or is happening) I think this is the most effective way to do it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just because &quot;multiple sources&quot; say otherwise, doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re right. Do you have any idea how to insure democracy in todays world? <strong>Paranoia.</strong> One must weigh the consequences of the two.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Paranoia- loss of friends, perhaps a bit less sleep, a few ruffled feathers here and there</p></li>
<li><p>Government Tyranny- indefinite detention, enslavement, forced vaccination, <strong>genocide</strong></p></li>
</ul>

<p>I don&#39;t know about you (actually, I think I do), but it&#39;s very clear to me which one of these two choices is the best one for me, and for everyone else on the planet to make. This is called critical thinking.</p>

<p>It is necessary to force everyone to take vaccines for every disease? Have you even thought about what such an initiative would entail? It means medical tracking of every person in the country, forced medical treatment. Isn&#39;t that against the general ethics of medical care?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been vaccinated as well. <strong>It proves nothing.</strong> New vaccines, <strong>and new agendas</strong> are created all the time. Let&#39;s say they do get these mandatory vaccination bills passed, and just a few years down the road, our economy collapses, and full-blown government dissidence becomes a major issue for the ruling elite. With the careful consideration of history, decades of social engineering saying the world is overpopulated, civil chaos and the biggest threat to the ruling class since the inception of the nation.</p>

<p><strong>What do you think they&#39;ll do?</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;ll tell you what- they&#39;ll manufacture a disease pandemic, declare Martial Law, round everyone up, and systematically murder millions of American citizens. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t be so naive and obedient. It&#39;s your blind trust, despite everything around you, that&#39;s going to get us all in serious trouble...</p>
