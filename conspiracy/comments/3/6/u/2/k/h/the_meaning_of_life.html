    <div class="md"><p>Lol. </p>

<p>Well, I&#39;m 27, commercial pilot, nice twin turbo Peugeot in the garage, and just about to buy my first house. </p>

<p>So I guess I&#39;m just a loser not working hard enough. </p>

<p>The thing is that I grew up in a reasonably wealthy family, so got a good education, and good job opportunities due to the family having a good name. I&#39;m not stupid enough to think my life is typical, and am absolutely aware that 95% of humans on the planet have it a lot worse than I do through no fault of their own. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats cool i always thought a pilot would be a great job, but my point is anybody can do well if they really try to, alot of ppl plod along in crap jobs complaining and waiting. Im 31 and grew up in a pretty dodgy situation, left home at 17 and worked crap jobs and spending my spare time learning eays to make more money and doing things like buying and selling cars to build some savings, began to put lots of time into learning about trading on sports and racing. Fast forward to today, im 31 own my house outright in a nice part of sydney and work 3 to 4 days a week in the comfort of my home, my life nowis great but there was a lot of hard work and sacrifices on the way.  I get sick of ppl complaining about things not being fair and they cant afford things but instead of saving or finding new ways to make money they spend money and time out partying or sitting round watching tv etc. Rant over  :)</p>

<p>But again, just because you did it doesn&#39;t mean anybody can. You&#39;ve obviously got natural intelligence, probably some charm, and probably had some good fortune along the way. </p>

<p>Please have a quick look at this comic below, I found it pretty sobering and I think it should go up in all schools. This myth that most people are only poor because they sit around watching tv needs to die. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats all good but even at the end of that comic the woman needs to find something to do on the side of her service job whether it be to learn or earn, im not saying everyone has it equal  but I think too many people think just working a 40 hour week in a dead end job will get them somewhere when really you need to do more than thay if you wanna do more than just &quot;get by&quot;.</p>

<p>The Meaning of Life</p>

<p>Ultimate and eventual self-realization, which involves identification with and as the Unified Source of all that is (what many call &quot;God&quot;).  This is something which likely takes a nearly countless number of incarnations in this, the human vehicle, and in other vehicles - some more solid (&quot;physical&quot;), some less solid (&quot;spiritual&quot;).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First and foremost, it seems we must have a good - or at least adequate - understanding of what the &quot;we&quot; in your question actually refers to.  I would say that the &quot;we&quot; refers not to the physical person in question.</p>

<p><em>It refers to the intelligent energy that animates that physical vehicle - that person - themselves.</em></p>

<p>In other words, as the (super) cool bumper sticker I came across a while ago said, we are not human beings having spiritual experiences.  We are <em>spiritual beings</em> having human experiences.</p>

<p>As such, we are ultimately not subject to the timeline of the Earthly, physical vehicle we temporarily ride around in and call &quot;our body&quot;.  We are ultimately on the timeline of that intelligent energy that is temporarily animating that physical vehicle.  It is <em>its</em> dictates and <em>its</em> timeline and <em>its</em> ultimate intentions and goals that this limited, physical vehicle is following whether it knows it or not.</p>

<p>The strange thing about this is that the goal, the plan, and the ultimate point of this particular life is - for some reason we know not what - currently <em>unbeknownst</em> to most if not all of us.</p>

<p>Most of us who enter this life are essentially flying almost entirely blind where it regards actually <em>knowing</em> why it is we&#39;re here, what our purpose for being here is, and (again, for many) what we have to do to get out of here and not have to experience the extreme difficulty of this life ever again.  Not knowing these things makes it very difficult to actually find your way while here - find what you&#39;re <em>supposed</em> to do and how you&#39;re supposed to do it.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve personally surmised, in my ongoing studies and investigations, that the ultimate point of this life, as I delineated in my above post, is self-realization - that is to say, an understanding of what one’s <em>true</em> self and <em>true</em> identity really is; a grasping of that self that exists <em>beyond</em> the veil of this physical life; that veil that actually <em>being</em> in this physical vehicle seems to prevent us from seeing in the first place.</p>

<p>The process toward this self-realization seems to involve, among other things, self-consciousness, self-awareness; AWARE OF YOUR SELF; of what you do and <em>why</em> you do things.  Constantly question as much as possible why you do what you do, why you feel what you feel, WHAT it is you feel in the first place, why you feel it, where that feeling and those feelings come from.  Question, investigate, think, contemplate the answers...contemplate the questions.</p>

<p>Read.  See what other people had to say about things.  See what questions others had to ask about this dynamic in general.</p>

<p>Study.  Study formally, study informally...but study <em>critically</em>.  <em>Think</em>.  Feel.  Understand as much as possible how it is you feel....WHAT it is you feel.  Don&#39;t just be aware of how you think...be aware of how you <em>feel</em> about things.  Oftentime (<em>most</em> of the time actually) how we feel is far more powerful whether we know it or not than what we think about a thing.  Get to know what your heart <em>feels</em> about things, and work on becoming as aware as possible of what your mind <em>thinks</em> about what your heart feels - what your mind thinks about what your emotions are feeling and experiencing.</p>

<p>This is all a very difficult thing, I&#39;ve found, but yet another thing I feel is also of utmost importance is to study the connection that exists in <em>all</em> life - all existence - in general.  Understand that all is connected.  Understand that science (<em>true</em> science, not corporate $cience) has already proven this.  Know that, since all is connected, and all is, necessarily, <em>one unit</em>, that you - your mind, your heart, your identity - is integrally connected with and <em>as</em> Everything That Is.</p>

<p>You are a raindrop in the ocean of existence.  As such, you are not only the raindrop...you are the ocean itself.</p>

<p>While in the brief, limited time that we are a tiny raindrop, we often become lost and forget that we are also the ocean.  We forget that we are ultimately one with what we came from.</p>

<p>I work hard at trying to become as conscious and aware as possible of <em>being</em> The One Ocean while in the midst of existing still as this little, tiny, limited raindrop.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The true meaning of life is that &quot;meaning&quot; and &quot;value&quot; are things that only exist in our minds, and it is up to each one of us to decide on our own.</p>

<p>Think of each life as a level in a video game, and each soul is a player. Each soul cycles through every life and over a few billion years and a few trillion parallel universes, every possible combination of actions is played an infinite number of times.</p>

<p>In each level there is a different number of possible outcomes, which lead to a number of alternatives, etc, on and on forever (or so it seems to us)</p>

<p>Your senses are observation tools and your soul is like a data recorder for a higher intelligence that will only switch on once it knows everything there is to know about living in this universe.</p>

<p>So all you have to worry about is experiencing as much as you can and not fucking up the experiences of your co-pilots.</p>

<p>So in becoming a &#39;seeker&#39; you can go beyond the ephemeral to the galaxies. The process of seeking itself transforms you, and that transformation is part of the purpose of life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no idea, no one knows. I&#39;ve been dealt multiple things in my life which tested me and re tested me. Deja vu isn&#39;t just something stupid trick of the mind, if you&#39;ve felt it enough, you will know. I&#39;ve recreated my reality a few times (mind over matter). We have far more power than they want you to believe. Think of the mind as a receiver/transponder. One thing that will blow your mind is dreams, look into that. Happy rabbit hole falling.</p>

<p>But again, just because you did it doesn&#39;t mean anybody can. You&#39;ve obviously got natural intelligence, probably some charm, and probably had some good fortune along the way. </p>

<p>Please have a quick look at this comic below, I found it pretty sobering and I think it should go up in all schools. This myth that most people are only poor because they sit around watching tv needs to die. </p>
