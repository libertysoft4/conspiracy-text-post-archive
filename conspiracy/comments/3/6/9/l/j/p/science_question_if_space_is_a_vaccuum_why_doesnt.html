<p>A theory in everyday life is generally said to be a thought or an idea you have right? However, in the scientific method, a theory is a hypothesis(an idea or a thought on how something works) that is already backed up with tests and experiments.</p>

<p>Gravity is a fact, this is proven. The only thing that may change, is how we interpret gravity</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gravity is their magical word created by knighted freemason Issac Newton to &quot;explain&quot; anything that doesn&#39;t fit into the heliocentric world view.  Gravity is weaker than any other force and there is no explanation where it came from.  Gravity from the moon supposedly effects the tides but not lakes and ponds.  </p>

<p>Truth is there is no &quot;vacuum&quot; in space.  The moon landing/space travel is a giant hoax.  People only parrot answers like &quot;Gravity&quot; because they hear their high priests like Neil DeGrasse Tyson or Bill Nye say it.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s funny after you think about it that we believe that at some magical point in the sky &quot;gravity&quot; just disappears.  So could you theoretically have half of your body on the gravity side and the other half on the non-gravity side?  It&#39;s ridiculous the &quot;scientific&quot; lies that we&#39;ve been fed.    </p>

<p>There is plenty of explanation of &quot;where it came from&quot;. Gravity occurs when objects have mass.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Gravity affects both of these things. Tides can be witnessed on sufficiently large bodies of water like the Great Lakes.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It doesn&#39;t disperse.</p>

<p>Well yes, technically I guess. Thought theres no &quot;non-gravity&quot; side.</p>

<p>I know that is the theory but it has never been reproduced or proven.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>They can also be perfectly still and are not always in rhythm like the oceans.  I live by a lake and the tides are bigger when there is more wind, go figure.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It doesn&#39;t disperse.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I meant to type disappear.  Yes according to &quot;science&quot; at some magical point we can break through gravity and emerge in a &quot;vacuum&quot; that does not contain gravity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well yes, technically I guess. Thought theres no &quot;non-gravity&quot; side.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you claim that this &quot;vacuum&quot; does have gravity?  OP&#39;s original question still hasn&#39;t been answered.  How is gravity of Earth held and separated from the vacuum?</p>

<p>Edit:  Easy to see which topics get brigaded. No way this many people stumbled into an obscure conspiracy post that had 0 points and then with in a matter of a few hours all my posts have massive downvotes even if I just provided a link that someone was asking for.  You must not question the NASA priest class.</p>

<p>Of course, now you&#39;re moving the goalposts.</p>

<p>What you&#39;re asking for is a picture, taken from far enough away, as to picture the whole earth in its frame.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a website with regularly updating images of the whole earth, from a variety of satellites, across a variety of spectra</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t forget asking if you trust all governmental branches, and if you believe the official story about 9/11. For me, it&#39;s no to the first, and mostly yes to the second one.</p>

<p>I think there are real conspiracies that are done a disservice by parroting this shit around everywhere. You make the legitimate look insane by association. If what you say is true, this conspiracy has been going on for 400 years. That&#39;s like ten or twelve GENERATIONS of humans without a single leak. We can&#39;t even keep secrets for one generation of people, let alone have the dedication to keep one for twelve for NO REASON. When there is nothing to be gained, and the alternative you offer makes no fucking sense whatsoever, it&#39;s hard to believe that tens of trillions of dollars are spent, accrued, and distributed in secret to cover up something so pointless.</p>

<p>You jump through insane hoops to imagine you are the gifted one, the truthteller. At the same time, you doubt that anyone in a population of seven billion people could find a shred of hard evidence for a 400 year conspiracy. You are like the definition of a conspiracy loon, and anyone with any self respect in this movement should loathe you to your core.</p>

<p>With just a descent pair of binoculars, you can make out the solar panels on the ISS. It looks like a little white tie fighter. I saw it once when a space shuttle was docked to it, and you could make that out too. <a href="http://www.techeblog.com/index.php/tech-gadget/amateur-astronomer-captures-iss-crossing-paths-with-jupiter">Check this out</a></p>

<p>I would really encourage you to get a pair of binoculars and start looking up. You can identify different aircraft types, and with a website like flightaware.com you can even find out where the planes are going. You&#39;ll also get accustomed to what a fast-moving, high-altitude aircraft looks like, and it will be very clear to you that a satellite, when you spot one, is much higher, and going much faster.</p>

<p>How can you possibly think you have all the answers when you don&#39;t understand free fall? You&#39;re so ignorant you don&#39;t even know what scientists think. You think they think that there is a spot above the Earth where gravity just &quot;stops&quot; and things start floating. But somehow you know that they&#39;re wrong even though you obviously don&#39;t understand what they say.</p>

<p>But by all means, i&#39;m very curious of this groundbreaking research you have made on the matter, since clearly you must know something everyone else doesen&#39;t</p>

<p>That the effect that you fall with increased momentum when you jump off the Empire State Building does not prove that gravity exists. There have been competing ideas such as Roman thought that things fell because it was their nature to be close to Earth.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re going to argue the scientific method, please don&#39;t get something so basic wrong.</p>

<p>It&#39;s very simple, the phone is heavier/more dense than the surrounding air so it falls.  something like helium that is lighter/less dense than the surrounding medium will rise.  You don&#39;t need a magic word called &quot;Gravity&quot; to explain that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Were you asleep during high school physics? There&#39;s a gravitational constant that occurs according the mass of two objects. You can&#39;t just pick up some balls and make them spin around each other, the gravitational pull is too weak. Now, take the Earth and the International Space Station, two very different masses and literally astronomically different sizes, the pull the earth has on the ISS is going to be much strong than anything we could observe in a classroom.</p>

<p>Also, you&#39;ve assumed a theory is something not proven but that&#39;s how it works. Multiple theories make up laws in the science world. The laws of physics include the theory of gravity, it&#39;s that simple. Gravity can be observed when the mass is big enough.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha, what? Gravity is a function of distance squared. No spot in the universe is not affected by gravity, it&#39;s just weaker some places than others. Waves are more visual in the ocean because there the moon is both pulling the waves towards it on the face of the earth that is towards the moon, but is pulling the earth from the water on the face that is opposite the moon.</p>

<p>Gravity acts like a field, just like magnetic fields. It&#39;s not just here or there, it&#39;s everywhere. It never disappears. Just as you can feel magnets pull harder against each other when they are near each other, gravity is always pulling. </p>

<p>Astronauts are not weightless, they are very much affected by gravity. They are constantly falling, trick is that they are going so fast perpendicular to the point they are falling towards that they &quot;miss&quot; and keep on falling.</p>

<p>You should really read an first course physics book, and try to understand what it is that you are arguing against. I recommend University Physics, as that both goes into the math and the physics parts required to understand Newtons theory of gravity.</p>

<p>On a side note: Gravity is also just a theory that explains how the world we observe works. It&#39;s an explanation, and one that explains most of what we see. </p>

<p>If you have a better explanation and you want to disprove the theory of gravity, you&#39;ll have to cook up an experiment where your theory holds true and gravity fails. If you can truly disprove gravity, you&#39;ll be world famous, and I look forward to seeing how your theory holds up to scrutiny.</p>

<p>Okay, you&#39;ve got gravity COMPLETELY wrong on this part. Space stations, astronauts, and even the moon are not weightless at all. The vacuum of space has gravity just like everywhere in the universe. If someone made a ladder that could reach the height of the space station and climbed it to the top, they&#39;d weight pretty much the same as they do on earth. All satellites are are falling towards the earth, but moving so fast sideways that the curvature of the earth keeps them from hitting the ground. The space station is moving at around 17,000 miles per hour!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The phrase &quot;just a theory&quot; has a very specific anti-scientific connotation. It&#39;s completely dismissive to the point of undermining or calling things into doubt that aren&#39;t particularly doubted in the scientific community as a whole.</p>

<p>Find anyone saying &quot;evolution is just a theory&quot; and you&#39;ll see what I mean. I used to be one of those people who would use that sort of phrase, so I know very well what it implies and what it actually means. </p>

<p>What it implies is that the theory isn&#39;t factual. Which is wrong. </p>

<p>What it actually means, however, is that the person making the statement doesn&#39;t fully understand how science actually works, as,in science, something can be considered both a theory and a fact.</p>

<p>Having a scientific conversation with someone who doesn&#39;t understand how science works is not generally a productive thing to do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you think a vacuum in space has force or power or something? It&#39;s just a relatively low pressure area with nothing but hydrogen atoms. Gravity keeps our relatively high pressure atmosphere intact. Without gravity, our high pressure atmosphere would move into the vacuum of space.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t take the word &#39;vacuum&#39; literally.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re having trouble grasping this: think about a submarine. The submarine is a relatively low pressure environment surrounded by a high pressure environment (the ocean). When the hull of the submarine breaks, the water rushes in (and NOT because the submarine &#39;vacuums&#39; the water). The opposite effect will happen if you are in a high pressure capsule surrounded by a low pressure field (like space); the opposite effect being one where things rush out (instead of in), and again, not because it is &#39;vacuumed&#39;. Gravity is the only thing keeping our high pressure environment intact by keeping it from escaping into the low pressure environment.</p>

<p>Another example: farting. Farting involves moving high pressure gas OUT of your body and into a low pressure environment. The low pressure environment is not vacuuming your fart.</p>

<p>2) have to do with flat earth, hollow earth, impossibility of space and whatnot, when again, all it takes is a little bit of research to uncover over a thousand years of evidence spanning from the middle east to Italy to Spain to the US.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hiya.  So... this is part of the field I work in (namely, astronomic spectroscopy.  Focusing on planet forming regions).  The reason that it doesn&#39;t work exactly as you think is because a vacuum has no actual force.  In space, the vacuum that you are thinking of is a literal absence of other things.  Gravity is an extremely weak force, you are correct - however, in the case of space, you have to realize that there are basically no other forces to counter it.  Gravity might be weak, but it works at very long range and only gets stronger as you get closer.  </p>

<p>As a result of that, molecules in space tend to eventually cluster and form objects - clouds, stars, asteroids, pulsars, black holes (I&#39;m stretching there), planets, etc...</p>

<p>In the case of Earth, you need to keep in mind that the atmosphere doesn&#39;t suddenly stop.  There is no hard line at where you can poke your hand out and have it explode because of the shift to 10<sup>-12</sup> torr.  Instead, as you get farther and farther from the surface of the earth, the atmosphere gets thinner and thinner.  From one perspective, you could actually say that there is no real difference between the surface and outer space - it&#39;s just that due to the gravity of this giant rock we&#39;re on, there is a much larger concentration of nitrogen, oxygen, and other gases near the surface of that rock.  </p>

<p>Technically any object of mass will attract anything else, given time and a sufficient absence of resistance (For instance, &#39;space&#39;). </p>

<p>That means that if you place a pair of dice, or bowling balls etc. In space, they will eventually meet given enough time. </p>

<p>Such a thing cannot be done on Earth. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>You should debate that, actually, as it&#39;s incorrect. You have a certain weight due to the overall amount of matter you contain and due to gravity, not due to density. For example, if you have 1 pound of feathers in a large bag, then compress those feathers into a smaller bag to decrease the overall density, their mass (and, likewise, weight) would not increase or decrease due to a change in density.</p>

<p>Also, you only have weight (not to be confused with mass, which exists independent of gravity) due to gravity, and this weight is variable based on the force of gravity being exerted on you. </p>

<p>While your mass remains constant (relatively, as it will grow and shrink due to eating, pooping, etc.), your weight on Earth, in Earth gravity, is more than your weight on the moon, in the moon&#39;s gravity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think I am &#39;earnest about truth&#39;, though I&#39;m definately what you&#39;d consider a skeptic. I&#39;d love to hear more feedback on this though.</p>

<p>The video was interesting, but flawed. In the first part about sunrays, sunrays ARE (almost)parallel. They appear to converge do to perspective. The examples they show of &quot;actual&quot;
Distant sun rays are done with the wrong perspective. In the first, fully cg scene, the observed sun rays are observed converging on a point in front of  the viewer. The distant sun rays point directly above the viewer. In the scene with the photograph,  the photograph is oriented so the sun is on the left of the viewer, while the parallel rays point to the right. In both cases the sun is in different locations than the picture. No wonder the rays dont align. In the second scene, you can even see how the actually parallel lines appear to converge at a point. This is caused, like the sun rays you see converging, by perspective. The sun rays in the images appear to come from the clouds straight down, diverging drastically. In actuality, they extend forward towards you, the percieved angle coming from the same source as the percieved angle between two parallel train tracks.</p>

<p>In the second argument with the reflection of the sun, the reflection behaves as if the earth is flat because the eArth essentially is. Its radius is so great and its curvature therefore so low that any divergence in behaviour from that of a plane is hard to detect. When interfered with by the comparatively huge perturbations of even gentle waves, it would be almost impossible. I dont know how to the &quot;following reflection &quot;thing because they dont explain it.</p>

<p>The sun shines in ALL Directions. It can shine on you and the ocean at the same time.</p>

<p>The reason your shadow never moves upwards is because as soon as the earth rotates so that the sun is even a  bit below your head, it is almost instantly occluded by the horizon.</p>

<p>The image of the galaxy is either an artists impression or an image of a different galaxy. Nasa has never, ever claimed to have an image of the milky way from the outside.</p>

<p>Imagine the earth is a globe for a second. Now imagine the earth was tilted so the north pole faced the sun. Obviously, at certain time of year, the entire northern hemisphere would have 24 hour sunlight. In reality, the tilt is not so extreme, so only smaller parts of the globe can have 24 hour day/night.</p>

<p>The tilt is what causes varrying days and seasons, as different parts of the earth are exposed to the sun differently.</p>

<p>The poles have seasons,  but one summer isn&#39;t enough to have enough effect before winter resets it.</p>

<p>The moon phase/ day swapping argument doesnt make sense to me, cant say anything to it until I get it. Haldway through the vid and a ginormous message so ill stop here for now. Again this is pretty interesting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Microgravity as a result of a &quot;small&quot; mass has been observed by the Rosetta comet mission. The lander, Philae, had to &quot;hop&quot; on the comet to go to a non-shaded spot so it can get sunlight for its solar cells. The hops were extremely light in force to make sure Philae doesn&#39;t hit escape velocity of the comet and fly off into space. This shows that an object no matter how &quot;small&quot; it is has gravity. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>mass of comet 67p: 10<sup>13</sup> kg</p>

<p>dimensions: roughly 4x3x2 km around</p>

<p>escape velocity on the comet: ~1 meter/sec</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the lander essentially had to hop at a speed less than 1/m a second in order to stay below the escape threshold and remain on the astral body. Also this post shows the irrationalities of lizard believers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So your only proof that space travel isn&#39;t real is because of an old idiom?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why can&#39;t they make a mountain of tungsten carbide and place a ping pong ball 1 mm away from it by all the laws of gravity it would prove gravity by pulling that ping pong ball towards it, but it can&#39;t</p>

<p>Why can&#39;t it? Is gravity not real?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a similar experiment to what you&#39;re describing: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schiehallion_experiment">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schiehallion_experiment</a></p>

<p>It was conducted by measuring the effect the gravity of a mountain had on a pendulum. By estimating the volume of the mountain, its density could be calculated and used as an approximation for the density of the Earth.</p>
