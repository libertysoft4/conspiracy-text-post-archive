<p>The CIA has done horrible shit for many years, decades even, and they are still around doing their thing.</p>

<p>They&#39;ll still try to call you a tin-foil hat wearing loon if you bring up MK-ULTRA and show them the documents where the CIA admits to it. Same if you bring up the Crack Epidemic in the US which was funded and controlled by the Intelligence Apparatus.</p>

<p>The CIA has trafficked drugs and laundered drug money for decades. </p>

<p>USA still thinks other countries think they are the land of freedom, the land of democracy and fair justice. I hate to burst your bubble, most think that America is a corrupt Oligarchy that is using their overblown military and torture to rule the world.</p>

<p>Another question is: Why do we allow the CIA to continue to exist when they have consistently embarrassed and disgraced our country for 50 years. We have CIA led coups of democracies that they couldn&#39;t ever keep secret from anyone. Several disastrous failed coups like the bay of pigs that they couldn&#39;t keep secret. Iran contra. Selling Crack in LA in the 80s. Torture. Spying on congress. Coming up with false evidence to go to iraq. And for what? Have they had a justification for their ridiculously antidemocratic actions since the cold war? What disaster have they prevented that could possibly justify the myriad disasters they continue to commit?</p>

<p>The sad part is there are idiots out there that think this is a valid justification. They destroyed the evidence to save their own asses from prosecution. </p>

<p>Those tapes were destroyed to cover up the politicians that initially agreed to the new torture techniques proposed by James Mitchell and Bruce Jessen (go look them up, real pieces of human waste). You and I are being told it was to prevent the global backlash that would come from the release. Honestly, I agree with that assessment. The damage those videos would have done to both the Bush and Obama administrations would have been irreversible...and I would have loved it. The things these animals did to innocent men and women is unspeakable. We&#39;ve reached a period where the new generation is forgetting the atrocities that occur at Abu Ghraib and the illegal detention of hundreds of Afghanis, Iraqis, and many more. To this day these people still sit in their cells even after being declared innocent...in some cases they were ruled innocent YEARS ago.. I would have loved for those tapes to be seen by the masses. A lot of people&#39;s opinions would take a drastic shift and this bubble we&#39;re forced to live in might finally pop.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are layers of censorship and misdirection so you&#39;re right, it would not be surprising to see this one censored. But as you well know (I recognize your user name from the better old days -- how&#39;s it going?) CIA torture is a somewhat approved topic for dissent. I guess because especially after <em>Zero Dark Thirty</em> the outrage at inhuman torture practices fits into a left-right political model, where the other ones acknowledge the brutality of the torture, but say it was deserved or necessary. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a> is not working as it should. The bot they were using had the IP blocked and it basically stopped posting removals. You should check <a href="/r/undeleteshadow">/r/undeleteshadow</a> as it works the way <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a> should (tracking removals from top 100), or <a href="/r/moderationlog">/r/moderationlog</a>. I guess banning of IP was in line with bitch Pao&#39;s recent statement.</p>
