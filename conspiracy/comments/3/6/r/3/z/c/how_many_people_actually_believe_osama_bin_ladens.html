I, for one, dont have that much faith in the people who, time and time again, have made decisions and statements that nepotistically favor the well-borns rather than The People. </p>

<p>This is one of those cases where it could be 100% true, or it could be 100% false, or it could be 50/50. We have absolutely no way of knowing for sure -- thus to make a choice of opinion on the matter is done so subjectively in faith, rather than objectively.</p>

<p>I like this sentence a lot. In fact, we can probably apply it to just about every modern topic of discussion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the exact reason people accuse &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; of claiming everything is a conspiracy.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not that everything is a conspiracy. It&#39;s just that knowing what we know, there is a deep distrust of the government and corporations.. and it&#39;s well founded. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like having a chronically abusive, lying family member. You always want to give them the benefit of the doubt, and usually do, because you love them. Time and time again you get betrayed and disappointed.. but for most people, they still continue the unhealthy cycle of co-dependance. For others, they realize that just because they are a family member and you love them, doesn&#39;t mean you have to be naive about everything they do wrong. </p>

<p>Be real about it. Don&#39;t assume fault, that&#39;s not fair.. but question everything. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it is the same situation. Whereby only a few select individuals truely know what happened that day, and since all &quot;evidence&quot; is withheld from public scrutiny save those hand selected to be presented (undoubtedly with ulterior motives), to believe Osama was actuslly killed, and in such a manner as those select few decided to share with us, is to, again, put 100% faith in the words coming from provably corrupt individuals. </p>

<p>I cant deny the events of that day, but nor can i subscribe to the alledged events either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reading list is fascinating with so many conspiracy books on it.</p>

<p>The way I see it, either one of these scenarios could be the truth:</p>

<p>A. This is the reading list of an actual person, who may or may not have &#39;played&#39; the character of OBL at some point after the real OBL died. Many of the videos released after a certain point are clearly fakes and several different people must have filled this function at some point, perhaps one of them was an ISI agent living in abbottobad. It almost reads like a list of study materials for someone on the inside.</p>

<p>B. This is a fake reading list meant to embarrass and/or discredit the books contained within,  also to conflate conspiracy theorists with terrorists.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I was thinking the same thing, actually. Why would his reading list contain books like:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Al-Qaeda’s Online Media Strategies: From Abu Reuter to Irhabi 007 by Hanna Rogan *(Id think, being the &quot;leader&quot;, hed know all about his own organization&#39;s strategies...)</p></li>
<li><p>A Brief Guide to Understanding Islam by I. A. Ibrahim</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Again, why? Did he have a have probpems understanding his own religion?</p>

<p>Makes more sense to me, what you said. I mean, there might be some legit reasons for these, but i jist cant think up of one atm.</p>

<p>I think maybe its a combination of your A) and B), as the list contains a wide variety of books and content, which may actually have some truths, but undoubtedly has many omissions as well as some additional titles invluded, in order to draw that parallel between terrorists and conspiracy theorists...</p>
