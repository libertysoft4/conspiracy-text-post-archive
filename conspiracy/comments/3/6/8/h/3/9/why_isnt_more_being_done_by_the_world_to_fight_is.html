All the West seems to be doing in the Middle East is pointless skirmishes, e.g. news headlines &#39;Top IS commander killed in Syria&#39;.

    <div class="md"><p>Correct. The US government is funding the Free Syrian Army which is spawning IS fighters and they are interchangeable in the ranks. Fight in Syria, fight in Iraq. Warmongering McCain, actually met with these fucks and openly spouts we need to fund them to topple Assad. Most of the FSA are not Syrian, but international mercenaries (IE. AQ and co).

    <div class="md"><p>And then the real question is....why? Well, I have an answer for that. The war in Syria is a battle over the US wanting a gas pipeline running  through it from Qatar to feed Europe, while Russia already feeds gas to Europe. That&#39;s why Russia is supporting Assad and the US is supporting the rebels. Follow the money, right?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I/we cannot give you hard proof because it&#39;s a CIA clandestine op. But, what we can give you is... The CIA funded the very organization and people which brought you Al-Qaeda via the Mujaheddin, in the Afghan/Soviet war. OSB was a Saudi (radical Wahhabi) not an afghan, and we funded and trained them to fight the soviets. These very same people went off to create havoc/terrorism in Chechnya, which was another clandestine op against the Russians. This has been going on for a long, long time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sounds about right, but with what end goal in mind?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>End goal? I honestly do not think they have one. Get while the getting is good. Lots of people are making a shit tonne of money off all this. Bomb a country, hire your contractors to rebuild while installing a puppet government which will sell their country out to corps seeking natural resources. There is also the drug trading, weapons trading, etc etc. Lot&#39;s of money in this. </p>

<p>In my opinion, there is never 1 specific purpose. They do these things for many different purposes, one of which (I think), is the NWO coming to fruition via  WW3.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can add to this: The end goal is clearly stated in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Grand-Chessboard-American-Geostrategic-Imperatives/dp/0465027261/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1431839699&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=the+grand+chessboard">this book, The Grand Chessboard</a>. The author, Brzezinski, is on all kinds of foreign policy boards along with Kissinger and the likes. There is most definitely an end game, but I sincerely doubt they will get there. The BRIC alliance is determined to stop them. (Brazil, Russia, India, China).</p>

<p>However, that is if the BRICS aren&#39;t apart of the scheme. It just seems too good to be true. I hope a new paradigm shifts, but, I&#39;m worried that this is just the game going as planned...sigh... Not too mention, this would be like a shotgun wound to the US...

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA%E2%80%93al-Qaeda_controversy">Al Qaeda, CIA and Afghanistan</a></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda_in_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina">Al Qaeda, used in Bosnia and Herzegovina</a></p>

<p>Al Qaeda has now been tied to 9/11, Syria, Iraq, Yemen and whatever country&#39;s crisis will come next. </p>

<p>ISIS is the new Al Qaeda now that Bin Laden is dead....the new boogie man to fight. Haven&#39;t you noticed how many times Al-Baghdadi, the supposed head of ISIS, has apparently died? I think we are now working on 9 scenarios and he keeps rising from the dead.</p>

<p>Israel isn&#39;t the strongest, but it may be P4P the worst, as it has <em>control</em> of the biggest bully on the block:  The U.S.</p>

<p>Yep.  This 100%.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t doubt that the UK is more evil in terms of the <em>depth</em> of its nefariousness...but the U.S. is by far the most <em>overt</em> in its aggression at this point...and Israel, well...again, they have control of the U.S. pretty much.</p>
