    <div class="md"><p>While central banks and killing presidents are controversial, their role in the Suez Canal and opium trade are more explicit. </p>

<p>The king of Egypt originally wanted nothing to do with a canal, but the costs were estimated, the Rothschilds extended the credit and a deal was struck giving the king incentives to pursue the project. </p>

<p>The project was grossly underestimated and when the initial funding ran out, the Rothschilds refused further credit to the king and took over his share, leaving England and the Rothschilds as the owner of the canal. Following the pattern established by the Rothschilds, this was likely coordinated from the start and is similar to how the World Bank operates today: lend to a nation on a project they know will fail and then use the debt to acquire the true wealth of the nation.</p>

<p>Much more interesting is the opium trade. The Rothschilds were major players in the business activities of the British in the East, active in funding expeditions, arranging banking in the East, establishing leaders in the trade, shareholders in the East India Co., and advisers to the crown. </p>

<p>When the Chinese rejected western goods in barter, and insisted on receiving silver, the Rothschilds advised the crown to use opium. A slave based opium production was established in India and ramped up for several years until the output was significant enough to undermine China&#39;s trade restrictions. The head of the opium supply was Sassoon, a Jewish emigrant to India with business connections to the British, ie Rothschilds. He is said to have become the world&#39;s richest man through his British enabled monopoly on the opium trade, but how much of this was actually profiting his puppet-masters is unknown. What is known is that his heir married a Rothschild and that his merchants, all Jews, funded most of the Ivy League universities in the US with opium money. These included the family of the Roosevelts. </p>

<p>If you follow their business model into the future, you see the major influence which has guided education, business, politics and financing for the last few centuries. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are a few comments to the tune of &quot;that&#39;s bad, don&#39;t kill people.&quot;</p>

<p>I want to say that if the Rothschilds are responsible for even a <em>fraction</em> of the things they are accused of, it is a wonder that they have not already been ripped out of their beds at night and killed in the street.</p>

<p>In fact, it&#39;s a surprise that more people don&#39;t respond to conspiracies in a more aggressive - let&#39;s say violent - way. If you believe that there are groups of individuals taking over the world, or people responsible for genocide, poisoning the water or air, or whatever the conspiracy theory may be, violence is a rational response. It&#39;s a measured and proportionate response. And if not now - if not in the context of the atrocities alleged - how bad does it have to get before the people finally put their abusers up against the wall?</p>

If you already have such an absorbent amount of wealth and power why try to get those last little bits? These nations would just be pocket change to them. There has to be some sacked out endgame goal here. Rfids, total control, depopulation but fuck if they wanted to they would have all the means to do it now and yet they aren&#39;t. Why? And the countries they don&#39;t control wouldn&#39;t put up much of a fight. I just don&#39;t quite understand the motivation behind it all and what they are allegedly trying to do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stop pinning the blame on certain individuals and families.. It&#39;s not necessarily any one humans fault, its the system they breed that also everyone else supports.. the far majority of us are part of the problem as much as we pin the blame on elected officials.. keep in mind, it&#39;s through hte process of us electing our responsibilities out to others that this problem arises out of as well.. and pinning the blame on something other then ourselves is just avoiding the problem.</p>

<p>Another valid point... Even if you were to take out the rothschilds, it would just be a matter of time before another family would take their place.. take your pic of the millions of corporations below them that would jump at the opportunity to be at the tip of this pyramid scam we call the marketplace, made possible due to a means of exchange and idea of private ownership..</p>

<p>Everyone that is pissed off at any one family really needs to examine the environment we all live in and are part of. In Capitalism or even the most free sense of the free market place without government/state intervention, the people that are the most successful in this society will always be the ones that use violence, theft, coercion, manipulation, lies, abuse, fear, plundering skills, etc etc to their benefit to screw the other person he does each hand shake with in the market place.. It creates an environment of competition, and the individual who is willing to screw over the other person more is rewarded monetarily and put on a pedestal and cherished as being &#39;successful&#39;.  Where as the opposite, the person that uses empathy and care and has moral high sense will always get ripped apart and taken advantage of in a market place or capitalist society... -- Talk about promoting all the wrong fucked up values humanity is capable while at the same time punishing those behaviors of humanity that has the possibility to elevate human consciousness and well being...  Whose supporting this monetary system + capitalist society, are you? then point the finger at no one else but yourself till you are ready to accept the fact that this model based on competition has never and will never work in society for the best outcome for all.</p>

<p>Like I said, removal of any one family will achieve fuck all.. it will only open the spot for another family to step in and be the next ones to rule till they are taken out for another family to come in.. rinse and repeat.. how long will this cycle go on before people realize that any environment that promotes competition (which can only exist with a monetary system or any means of exchange + idea of private ownership + free market) will never bring about a just, healthy society?  we need to move away from competition towards cooperation, till then poverty, inequality, human exploitation, anxiety, depression, sickness, misery, stress, etc etc will continue unabated....</p>

<p>I&#39;ve read about them. They made their money mostly in banking. A major business line was underwriting and trading in government bonds. I haven&#39;t yet found any reliable source which says that they have ever owned even one central bank.</p>
