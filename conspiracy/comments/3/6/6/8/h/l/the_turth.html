        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There is a time where one wakes up in ones life and has a moment of clarity. A realization that what you&#39;ve been told or led to believe doesn&#39;t add up. You begin to realize that the system you grew up in is flawed, rigged, and stacked against you. You start to connect the dots and realize that there is something sinister that is lurking in the background. An unseen hand that is dictating finances, global policies, governments and etc. You research and get caught up in all the various conspiracies. You want to share this with the the world and shout it at the top of your lungs. &quot;Can&#39;t you see see the system is rigged! Can&#39;t you see the media is a method of control to keep us divided and separate from one another!?&quot; But it falls on deaf ears. And then you feel powerless.</p>

<p>But then something happens. You begin to realize that instead of trying to change the world and those around you. You begin to focus on yourself. You spend your time and effort in becoming the change you want to see. You treat others how you want to be treated. You are loving to yourself and to those around you. Then something incredible occurs. You start seeings what&#39;s going right within your world. Your reality. And then you realize that you are the instrument of change. And that by caring for yourself and others you are creating the reality you want t to see. You stop focusing on the negativity and focus on what makes you feel good. And by doing so you are creating the world you want by every thought, action and belief. And that is how you change yourself and as a result you are changing the whole. We are the master of our own realities and collectively we are creating the human story that currently exists. Take ownership of your life. Take the power back that resides within you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was at zero, I upvoted and it immediately returned to zero. I am seeing major signs of vote-brigaiding all over this sub right now. So many strangely down voted posts that would normally be upvoted in this sub, from my experience at least.</p>

<p>Anyways, I absolutely 100% agree with everything you said. I&#39;ve noticed my personality has changed, I&#39;ve become far kinder than ever before, I can&#39;t even bring my self to be mean or lie most of the time. I feel like I am a better person than I have ever been before. However, I still feel an endless anxiety over the state of this country and the world. I can change my own life, but I&#39;m still worried about all the people that are suffering, and may soon suffer much more. I wish I knew how to do more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s absolutely ridiculous that people would let something as silly as a typo detract from their ability to accept, understand and approve a message. Grammar nazis sit on their high horse correcting people but fail to realize that spelling matters not in the communication of a message, if you can understand what was written, then why does the spelling matter? Letting spelling mistakes distract you so much is what&#39;s asinine. Fucking superiority complexes on the internet, I swear. I find it ironic that a bunch of people striving to achieve true freedom allow themselves to be bound by such feeble chains. Smh</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really. They often defuse powerful posts by inserting laughable spelling and or grammar errors to detract from or defuse the message. It&#39;s a pattern.</p>

<p>The mods should correct the obvious mistakes imo.</p>

<p>Imagine this post without the errors?  Gold and <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> most likely.</p>

<p>Protip: if you make a powerful or important post double and triple check the spelling etc and come back 30 mins later and check again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The harm they are trying to do is convince others of the non-merit of your ideas because people derping into the conversation will subconsciously associate your vote totals with what you are saying. So if all your shit is downvoted, guess you must be a <em>loser</em>. (for the record I agree with your statements here, and I wish you all the best in your continued noble effort)</p>

<p>Objectivity is a lie. No human should have dominion over another. all human actions are motivated by service to self or service to others. All systems used by humans are interconnected. </p>

<p>Every problem in the world is the result of those things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I once was having a discussion with someone about GMO&#39;s when they said in a defensive tone, &quot;Do you see this crack in the table? That&#39;s how much I care.&quot; </p>

<p>That&#39;s when it hit. Change yourself, not others. I use an app that scans products and it tells me if that company is screwing the system or not. I use that on my water. My Co worker saw me doing this in the store one day. It was met with derision and confusion, at first, but I kept on doing it. Now he does it.  I&#39;m eating whole veggies, fish and other healthy foods and now my dad is eating healthier after years of red meat. Own your weirdness, as that&#39;s what we are to most people. If you own it, they will respect it. </p>

<p>This is so true OP, thanks for sharing. I always say this, but it rings true for me and maybe some others. <em>Carry the fire</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was blown away, to say the least, as it was a family member. I look back at my first phase, the one where I felt the need to share this appalling news I had just learned with everyone and realized how scatter brained I was knowing all this stuff and not being able to coherently piece it together.

<p>Look up the Forbes 400 list of richest Americans for 2009 compaare it to the list for 2014</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post, great message.</p>

<p>We can&#39;t change shit in this country or this Empire most redditors live in until you decide <strong>right now</strong>, that you, personally and individually, despite moral obligations and hesitations, are perpetuating a system of corruption, overseas slave labor, high-end-banking robbery, and governmental surveillance never seen before in the history of mankind.</p>

<p>But - there is a solution, and like youe beautifully put OP suggests, it starts by first acknowledging this fact, and making <strong>changes from within</strong> to make yourself, your family, and your community more self sufficient from <em>the system</em> and the government structure as a whole.</p>

<p>Our manufactured and systematically designed dependence on <em>the system</em> is juat another mechanism of control, and the sooner we all realize this the better.</p>

<p>We can feed and clothe most in the world if supply and demand structures were organized on a need-based system and not a profit based system. </p>

<p>Collectively, Human Beings as a race are the most intelligent and creative species (self centered much? The irony is not lost, trust me) on this floating rotating rock. And we spend **vast resources not on education, encouraging creativity and infrastructure, but things that destroy and profit from rebuilding. </p>

<p>Ask yourself - why? Why is this system the one that is most dominant? Is it by chance? Or have rich, powerful people figured out  a way to make money off of getting other people to fight their WARS for them, FOR PROFIT (because why else?), and this is the system we are stuck with.</p>

<p>Propagandize the next generation that the antagonist <em>must go</em>, make it noble to <em>serve</em>, and you are <strong>good to go</strong>. Haliburton, Boeing, Lockheed, General Electric, and others will peofit off of your sons&#39; and daughter&#39;s blood, sweat, tears, and the prime of their life.</p>

<p>And it is truly a sad state of affairs to watch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly! That moment of waking up and stuff came when I first watched a video of Ron Paul in a debate in the fall of 2011 on YouTube. The things he said completely changed my whole view on politics and life completely. It was as if I had found the exact word, exact political beliefs that were within me my whole life - libertarianism. Just leave people alone unless they hurt other people. It changed my life. And then he exploded in popularity. I mean, it was terrific! Now it seems a lot of the country and the world over have been exposed to those beliefs and they agree. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i remember when i &#39;&#39;wake up&#39;&#39; it was hard to work, watch tv or any entertainment watch a news program. watch police offcer talk. politics talk, philosopher talk and see people fighting, murdering for nothing. and realizing how F*** big is the abyss and still is to be a active or complacent part of the system.and life goes on, what can we do. reality this abyss is massive.
Just to say, but sometimes i just think only Jesus really can fix this</p>

<p>So are you telling us to ignore evil and stick our heads back in the sand?</p>
