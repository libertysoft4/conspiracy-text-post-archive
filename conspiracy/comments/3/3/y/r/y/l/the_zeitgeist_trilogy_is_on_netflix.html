    <div class="md"><p>Well, he&#39;s not, but even if he was, that isn&#39;t the point. The point is he created a thought-provoking documentary series that shows how flawed our system is and that we as a species have the complete potential to change it and make it so that it benefits everyone living on this planet instead of a select few. Nothing will ever be perfect, but we will ALWAYS have the ability to make things better. To refuse to take initiative is to refuse your own freedom.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s nothing wrong with democratic socialism. The problem is full blown socialism/communism or on the other equation full blown capitalism.

    <div class="md"><p>The Bible is ridiculous. Regardless whether his debunking was accurate or not, the fact is that religion separates man from each other.

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you somewhat in principle as people are holding on to outdated aspects of religion, such as ideas that you must believe what they believe or you are doomed, but what about Jesus narrowing the ten commandments down to 2 commandments, love God and love one another, this is what I take from the Bible, this is the part of importance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The point is the Bible is obsolete. It should have no presence in today&#39;s society to try and dictate how we live our lives. The commandments were never real. God never told anybody to love anybody. Humans love by nature and destroy by behavior.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that the Bible is obsolete. I believe humans were of a more ignorant barbaric nature in the past and God has worked to progress humanity. Jesus was a light in the world creating a revolution of love at a time when people were ready to receive his message. No one needs the Bible today, but it&#39;s history is interesting for seeing where we&#39;ve come from and where we are now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are right. In the story of the Bible, Jesus loved lepers, prostitutes, sinners, the poor, (but not gays, they can go to Hell), yet we see that the people who are highest in political power boast of how they devote their lives to Jesus, yet they fail to follow his teaching of caring for the sick and the poor. Instead, they use it to manipulate voters and pocket as much money as they can. The only thing they seem to practice from the Bible is hating gays and shaming others, damning them for being &quot;wrong&quot;. I will believe there is a God when he rids the world of poverty, sickness, and all other horrible devices he is responsible for. God would be a tyrant if he truly existed. If people truly wish to worship a god, they should worship all of creation instead. They should keep their Earth healthy and clean. They should appreciate the mysterious and infinite unknown of the universe and embrace its magnificence, not sucking up to some man so they can get into &quot;Heaven&quot;. These people are constantly worried about what happens after they die and to make it into Heaven, but their ignorance prevents them from seeing that they have the complete capability to create their own Heaven on Earth if they were truly willing to embrace and spread unconditional love and unite with others as a people. If every religious person did that instead of making reasons to start wars and kill others for their lack of faith, I would respect religion.</p>
