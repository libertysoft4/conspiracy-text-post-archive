First check out all images of earth REAL non-composite photos in google. Next checkout all the fake bubble videos of them in space (underwater) hanging upside down in harnesses and using zero G planes for the weightlessness. The ancient yin yang symbol is actually how the sun and moon rotate above us. Read the book on the website &quot;flat earth conspiracy&quot; and you too will be convinced. But honestly it was doing my own experiments and testing my findings against reason versus what I have swallowed as truth over the years.</p>

<p>Also try these experiments yourself and check out the non crazy videos on the subject. Most videos on the link I provided should be enough. Watch the Nixon phone call to the moon, it was complete propaganda, no questions like whats it like just pure speech written garbage.</p>

<p>This really is the mother of ALL conspiracies, if we can get them on this we can literally shutdown government.</p>

<p>Also if the earth is spinning at 1000mph how could a helicopter hover? Why do not planes travelling from NY to CA get their in a much shorter time than CA to NY if we are dealing with a rotating earth?</p>

<p>How would he know? No one is allowed to explore the south pole without military or government escorts.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen people postulate that we could live on an infinite plane and beyond the edge is a lot of snow and ice and then possibly other earth-like locations.</p>

<p>That seems more likely to me than some sudden drop off or edge like most people conceptualize when they hear flat earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some of us do, slave dude.  Some of us who don&#39;t post knee jerk reactions like this other guy.....hahaha....some people are so afraid to get their worldview flipped upside down its unreal....the earth very well may be a flat infinite plane, no escape, ever.  Science would have you believe in our present solar system, and works tirelessly to kill any idea of god or as I call it, an architect or programmer.....why? Because they are in POWER. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not totally on board yet.  The whole &quot;NASA is all fake&quot; shit is a hard pill to swallow....I have seen &quot;Room 237&quot; and it did rock my socks, but.....couldn&#39;t this all exist just as it does even with a flat earth?  </p>

<p>I think the more important overall objective here, is to start thinking for ourselves again, and break away from this current spoon fed educational system which solely exists in its current state, in order to make nice little well believing productive slaves who provide knee jerk ridicule to anything resembling inquisitive thought!</p>

<p>I have some questions:</p>

<p>If the Earth is flat, how did it form?</p>

<p>If the Earth is flat, what&#39;s the depth of the Earth?  Do we still have crust, mantle, and core?</p>

<p>How would one get mountains, volcanoes, valleys, ocean basins, etc. on a flat Earth?  Plate tectonics creates those things, and if the Earth is flat, where is the material for new plates coming from?  Where is the old material going?</p>

<p>Why would we be flat, and yet, with very simple technology that&#39;s been around since the 17th century, we can see that every other celestial body out there is spherical?</p>

If the Earth is flat, what&#39;s the depth of the Earth? Do we still have crust, mantle, and core? Short answer no
How would one get mountains, volcanoes, valleys, ocean basins, etc. on a flat Earth? Plate tectonics creates those things, and if the Earth is flat, where is the material for new plates coming from? Where is the old material going?
Why would we be flat, and yet, with very simple technology that&#39;s been around since the 17th century, we can see that every other celestial body out there is spherical? The bodies are circular but not spherical, look at the moon you have only seen one side of it your whole life and we are supposed to believe and object going 67000 mph around the sun (earth) and another pobject (moon) going 2300mph around us just so perfectly we only see one side of it?

    <div class="md"><p>Ahh you want to take it out of context, you were referring to me being home schooled. My IQ is in the 99% or highest 1% and have been accepted to the finest schools, even setting a record for the entrance exam at Christian Brothers Academy in New Orleans City Park. As for college I dropped out due to me learning more on my own than 5 year old textbooks in computer science back in the early 90&#39;s (I was learning more on my own than college was teaching).</p>

<p>I have worked with the White House, Pentagon, Fort Knox, Duke University, Johns Hopkins, Wal-Mart and around 100 other recognizable company names.</p>

<p>You have called me a nut but please explain how a helicopter can hover in midair on a ball spinning at 1000MPH? Where are some REAL NASA photos? </p>

<p>Gravity which is known to be the weakest of all forces somehow magically pulls the hovering aircraft along with it at 1000MPH? How come this spinning of the earth does not in anyway affect the outcome of projectiles regardless of the direction you are pointing?</p>

In the Fauklans war between Britain and Argentina, the British tried to shell the Argentinians and missed because they were used to firing in the northern hemisphere, so their aim was off.

The helicopter hovers like that because it has the same momentum in the first place. As it sits in the ground the entirety of its weight is also moving at the same speed as the earth. When it lift off the ground it retains that inertia. If a helicopter can hover perfectly in the exact same spot long enough without influences from other sources then it would likely lose some ground with the earths surface. Get back to using the stand debate fallacies the mystery starts falling apart with this troll when you begin trying to give evidence.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Were people told the Earth was a &quot;perfect circle&quot;? I&#39;m not sure that was ever really true. As far as I know we&#39;ve had models describing the stretch and compression of spherical celestial bodies for some time.</p>

<p>Degrasse Tyson describes the Earth as &quot;pear shaped&quot;. Of course, that doesn&#39;t mean he says it&#39;s a giant bartlett-pear floating around in space. &quot;Pear-shaped&quot; of course means that it has some resemblances; this is the quote</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Earth is not only oblate — wider at the equator than pole-to-pole, but pear shaped — slightly wider just south of the equator</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Earth is spherical yes. From any naked observer it appears a perfect sphere; but according to Tyson and many others there are (relatively) minute differences in circumference around the earth which suggest it is not a perfect sphere. </p>

<p>He never said the Earth would look like this</p>

<p>You&#39;ll have to forgive me as I&#39;ve commented on these types of posts many times.  If he&#39;s still here, just ask <a href="/u/SkyCentrism">/u/SkyCentrism</a>.</p>

<p>Again, you make the claim, the burden of proof <strong>is</strong> on you.  Sorry if you don&#39;t like it, but that&#39;s the way it is.  You can&#39;t say &quot;Humans are actually amphibians&quot; and not say why you think that.  And I&#39;ve tried to google what you said, but the parameters you gave us are either waaaaay too specific or we have to modify it and then we get millions of results.</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t handle people disagreeing with you and trying to get you to prove your claims, don&#39;t bother telling people your beliefs then.  You will never meet someone who agrees with you 100% on everything.  Is this how you react every time someone challenges you?</p>

<p>Also, Coursera is a great resource for some free education.  I suggest learning some Physics and some Astronomy.  Once you get those down, maybe some Geology, Meteorology, and other things of an Earth Science-y kind.  Just a recommendation.  I am currently getting my degree in Earth Science for Meteorology, and have had to take every class I&#39;ve listed above, so while I may not be an expert, I&#39;m not just talking out of my ass. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read &quot;Wagging the Moondoggie&quot; five years ago, so I know the Apollo story is hooey. </p>

<p>I always attributed the lack of evidence of curvature to the immensity of the earth.  I read that a ball bearing has more surface irregularities than the earth does, with its mountains.  </p>

<p>What things are visible across immense distances?</p>

<p>The thing piqueing my interest now is Antarctica.  It&#39;s so much colder and more forbidding than the arctic.  All of Alaska is above the 60th parallel N, but anything below the 60th parallel S is off limits and nobody lives there. I always assumed the Arctic and Antarctic were equivalent but it doesn&#39;t look that way.</p>

<p>Also weird how no flights go over Antarctica.  A flight from Buenos Aires to Sydney should go over Antarctica to take the shortest route, but it doesn&#39;t.  </p>

<p>If true, this is a bigger conspiracy than anything I&#39;ve ever investigated.  It seems to imply that our world is artificial, that someone made it.  I can understand how stars and planets form, but I can&#39;t understand how a big flat disc would form, or what would be underneath it.  Ever see &quot;The Truman Show&quot; with its fake sun and sky?  Kind of feeling like that right now. </p>

<p>It might explain where UFOs come from. Not from light years away, maybe just from the other side of Antarctica.  </p>

<p>OTOH, a lot of the FE videos are bullshit.  I have already disproved two of their claims.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, a lot of videos are bad and/or put forth unverifiable claims.</p>

<p>I try not to put any stock into what this place is. I consider my foremost position to be disproving the globe.</p>

<p>The most convincing evidence comes from the basic problem that if the earth is curved, eventually things in the distance should drop out of view, as well as orienting themselves relative to that curve. There is relatively simple math that demonstrates that the curvature is equal to 8 inches per miles squared. </p>

<p>This can be shown not to be the case.</p>

<p>There was a recent photograph called into question, that has been taken by many over the years by many people</p>

<p>It is the Chicago skyline seen from Grand Mere state park in Michigan.</p>

<p>Just google image search: Chicago from Michigan</p>

<p>The results are plentiful.</p>

<p>Now you&#39;ll hear this dismissed as a &quot;superior mirage.&quot; </p>

<p>As if it makes any sense at all that the &quot;atmosphere can reflect over 3,000 feet of skyline which should be occulted by the earth&#39;s curvature perfectly into view on a regular basis.</p>

<p>It&#39;s absurd. The people who believe that nonsense are the same people who think we landed a tin can on the moon back in 1969 with the technological equivalent of a graphing calculator.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Who came up with this equation?  </p>

<p>I tried it on a large scale:  </p>

<p>Traveling overland, distance from pole to equator is 6,225 miles (the entire circumference of 24,901 divided by 4).  </p>

<p>6,225 x 6,225 = 38,750,625</p>

<p>38,750,625 x 8 inches = 310,005,000 inches</p>

<p>310,005,000 inches  = 4,892 miles</p>

<p>But drop off (distance from pole to equator tunneling through center of earth) is only 3,958 miles.  </p>

<p>The equation gives 23% too much curvature.</p>

<p>So the multiplier should be 6.5 inches, not 8 inches.  6.5 gets it pretty close:  3,975 miles</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL, the point is I believed the current model hook line and sinker for over 3 decades. I studied the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics and desperately tried to find the unifying equation that would meld the two into harmony. I studied string theory, M Theory, up quarks, down quarks, muons etc... </p>

<p>Then it just hit me all at once with the miscalculation of the proton weight that wasn&#39;t corrected until 2013 by Nassim Haremein, that all this shit could possibly be made up bullshit. Meant to only further confuse and take away meaning from their life that they were some kind of freak accident. When you look a the cultural narratives and really look at what schools are teaching and go even higher up you find that everything is really very simple and I am not trying to say its dumb just simple. Gravity&#39;s force is 9.8 meters per second squared downwards I have tested this one. But the rest of theoretical physics and sciences are just that mental chess games with no real apparent chess board to play on.</p>

<p>Why aren&#39;t their any real graphics from NASA? Where are the photos after trillions spent that are not computer generated?
Yesterday I was in Barnes and Nobles and saw a very large book called Hubble, I looked through the book and every single image looked fake as fuck with even pixelation on the image of Hubble supposedly in orbit.</p>

<p>I get it flat earth is a wacky idea and the one that the further and more you play with it the more it makes sense until you get your aha moment.The current paradigm of astrophysics is just trumped up mathematics, speculation, fake imagery, by genius con artists. The people in charge cannot absolutely cannot tell the truth in ANY matter at all. There are no satellites, what goes up must come down.</p>

<p>Everywhere you look you will see it once you have awakened. This goes against every fiber of my being. I was a left brained scientific atheist nerd who would ride up to a spot when I was a young boy with my telescope to see Halley&#39;s comet. I have multiple universe and astronomy books, I get it trust me. This is not any easy pill to swallow but a necessary one to unenslave humanity from the biggest lie and scam ever in the history of histories.</p>

<p>But if you are really an open minded free thinker and want to learn the truth, this YouTube video will prove it: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDSS5k-105M">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDSS5k-105M</a> You will be convinced.</p>

<p>It explains so many scientific discrepancies. I know it&#39;s a tough pill to swallow, but have a look. The more you research it, the more sense it makes.</p>

<p>And don&#39;t get confused by those flat earth-ists. Flat earth is just a false flag theory set up by the establishment to discredit all conspiracy theorists and our research into the hollow earth truth. </p>

<p>It really is the mother of all conspiracies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok as a amateur astronomer please explain to me why (with my own eyes) the stars in the night skies above St. John&#39;s Newfoundland Canada rotate around a central point (usually referred to as the North Star or Polaris) counter-clockwise? Then when observing the beautiful night skies above Halfmoon Bay NewZealand the stars rotate clockwise around a central point (usually know as the Southern Cross)? Another problem I have with the flat earth model is the moon. Why does the moon appear inverted (if you where born and raised in the Northern hemisphere) when observing it in the Southern hemisphere? One more problem, why doesn&#39;t the sun change in angular size when observing it&#39;s path across the sky? Why doesn&#39;t said angular size change when observing the sunset with a 100x magnification (using a solar filter). In the flat earth model the sun rotates around the north pole so when observing the sun in the west it should be getting smaller in size as it moves away from you? Explain these small problems and I&#39;ll look into to your flat earth further.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is becoming more and more compelling to me the more I look into it as well.  At the very least, I feel confident in saying that the Apollo missions were Masonic hoaxes in their entirety, that there is something very substantial being hidden in Antarctica, and that there are some major, major problems with both special and general relativity, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/33hsti/premise_emc2_is_mathematically_illogical_and/">one of which I attempted to outline here.</a></p>

<p>I mean seriously, what are the odds that the Moon and Sun would just happen to be the <em>exact</em> size and distance away from each other and the Earth for an eclipse to occur and that the Moon would be spinning/traveling at the <em>exact</em> speed so that we only ever see one side of it?  It&#39;s mathematically impossible, or about as close as you can get.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Correct the Masons use fibonacci and other things to develop this model which to the average person will make sense. Just today go outside and look, I saw the sun at 45 degrees and the moon at 45 degrees on the opposite side yet it&#39;s a half moon how if these proportions  (standard model) are correct could the earth block out the moon if these were 45 degree apart or 90 degrees apart and I am standing in the middle of a sphere. Also pay attention to how surrounding clouds look around the sun the part away from the sun casts shadows which would be impossible if it were 93 million miles away. This is the biggest scandal of all times and must be one that is corrected, I see this issue as the catalyst that will shine the light on all of the other lies and conspiracies. It doesn&#39;t take a lot of intelligence to grasp the experiments one can do if they just could get over  it in there head first. I have been trying to tell people and they get as upset about this as when I tell people there is no Jesus coming to save you (sun of god). This stance requires bravery and not idiocy as most have come to assume.</p>
