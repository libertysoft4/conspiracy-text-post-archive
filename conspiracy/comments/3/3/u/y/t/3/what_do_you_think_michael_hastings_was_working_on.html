    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t doubt that.  I think the case had huge implications, especially here in Canada, because it put Canada&#39;s avowed support for human rights and international law squarely on the line.  Canada could not grant Matt DeHart refugee status without stating, publicly, that the United States is guilty of torturing one of its own citizens, which a US District Court Judge (Margaret Kravchuk) apparently believed.  Canada conveniently used the charges of child pornography (charges that are, in all likelihood, trumped up) to declare him inadmissible to the country.  That way, his refugee asylum claim will not have to be decided.  His request was simply ignored; he was deported.  Who give a flying f* what happens to him now.  Not Canada&#39;s problem.</p>

<p>None of this would really matter; it would have happened completely off our radar screens, had it not been for the National Post, and the 5-part series written by Adrian Humphreys, a senior reporter for the paper.  That series was a bombshell,  the editors of the National Post declaring that &quot;a months-long National Post investigation finds there may be some truth to the DeHart family&#39;s claims that the charges are a cover-up.&quot;</p>

<p>In other words, the editors of the National Post believe Matt DeHart&#39;s story. Maybe Michael Hastings believed, as I do, that there&#39;s more to the story than was ever revealed.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Evidence of murder unfortunately has been lost. Just what caused Hasting’s car to jack sideways and burst into flames is unlikely to ever be proven, definitively, because the car and many of its working parts have been destroyed by fire or shattered by the impact against the tree. But several facts point to murder. Hastings was speeding, as though running from a threat, at an odd hour – 4:25 am. The car suddenly jacked sideways, indicating a mechanical problem that would affect the steering. Else did it hit a pothole in LA? And the car burst into flames, an unusual result in modern cars where the tank is under the rear seat, especially when the car is not hit from the side but from the front. But this is something a bomb could arrange.</p>

<p>Hastings was murdered, an end he frankly expected at some point due to his aggressive investigative reporting. He could not be threatened or bribed, nor would he take subtle hints or modify the truth by omissions to avoid confrontations with those in power. He received a warning, and thus at an odd hour was trying to change locations, fleeing. His car had been tampered with so the car would accelerate and then torque sideways to crash or flip, timed to be accompanied by a bomb that caused his fiery death. What was he working on that his death was arranged at this time? <strong>Given his track record, he was unlikely to back away from the inside stories on the cover-up over Nibiru. He was thus silenced before the stories could break.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no idea what he was working on. He was a danger to Washington interests and assassinated in a way that made it look like a drug-alcohol fueled accident. He was quickly forgotten. Brad Pitt must see something in the book Hastings wrote or he wouldn&#39;t get involved in this Netflix movie deal. Oddly enough, Hastings is the surname of Netflix&#39;s CEO.</p>
