        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>NIST claims that WTC 1&amp;2 collapsed due to jet fueled fires (just normal offices fires for WTC7) which were not hot enough to produce molten steel or iron, but also claim that if there had been molten steel or iron in the debris afterwards, it would have been irrelevant to the cause of the collapses. The evidence of molten steel or iron cannot be called “irrelevant,” given the fact that the building fires, as NIST pointed out, cannot explain it.</p>

<p><strong>Physical Evidence</strong></p>

<hr/>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.fema.gov/pdf/library/fema403_apc.pdf">Early in 2002, Barnett and two WPI colleagues published an analysis of a section of steel from one of the Twin Towers, along with sections from WTC 7, as an appendix to FEMA’s 2002 World Trade Center Building Performance Study</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.wpi.edu/News/Transformations/2002Spring/steel.html">Their discoveries were also reported in a WPI article entitled “The ‘Deep Mystery’ of Melted Steel,” which said:</a></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Steel – which has a melting point of 2,800 degrees Fahrenheit – may weaken and bend, but does not melt during an ordinary office fire. Yet metallurgical studies on WTC steel brought back to WPI reveal that a novel phenomenon – called a eutectic reaction – occurred at the surface, causing intergranular melting capable of turning a solid steel girder into Swiss cheese.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.wpi.edu/News/Transformations/2002Spring/steel.html">Stating that the New York Times called these findings “perhaps the deepest mystery uncovered in the investigation,” the article added:</a></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>A one-inch column has been reduced to half-inch thickness. Its edges – which are curled like a paper scroll – have been thinned to almost razor sharpness. Gaping holes – some larger than a silver dollar – let light shine through a formerly solid steel flange. This Swiss cheese appearance shocked all of the fire-wise professors, who expected to see distortion and bending – but not holes.</p>

<li><p><a href="http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2005/1165/508OF05-1165.html">In 2005, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) published a report entitled “Particle Atlas of World Trade Center Dust,” which was intended to aid the “identification of WTC dust components.” Among the components, it reported, were “metal or metal oxides” (which could not be distinguished by the USGS’s methods). “The primary metal and metal-oxide phases in WTC dust,” the report said, “are Fe-rich [iron-rich] and Zn-rich [zinc-rich] particles</a></p></li>

<p><strong>Testimonial Evidence</strong></p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Testimony from Firefighters:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQyIN6OTMyY">New York Fire Department Captain Philip Ruvolo said: “You’d get down below and you’d see molten steel, molten steel, running down the channel rails, like you’re in a foundry, like lava.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://fallenbrothers.com/community/showthread.php?2062-Recovery-worker-reflects-on-months-spent-at-Ground-Zero&amp;p=2948">Joe O’Toole, a Bronx firefighter who worked on the rescue and cleanup efforts, reported that one beam lifted from deep below the surface months later, in February 2002, “was dripping from the molten steel.”</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_G21B2qiQM">New York firefighters recalled in the documentary film Collateral Damages, “heat so intense they encountered rivers of molten steel.”</a></li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Testimony from Other Professionals:</strong></p>

<hr/>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjmHqES_lto&amp;t=40s">Leslie Robertson, a member of the engineering firm that designed the World Trade Center, said 21 days after the attack: “When we were down at the B1 level, one of the firefighters said, ‘I think you’d be interested in this,’ and they pulled up a big block of concrete and there was a, like a little river of steel, flowing.”</a></li>
<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060909104247/http://www.seau.org/SEAUNews-2001-10.pdf">Ron Burger, a public health advisor at the National Center for Environmental Health who arrived at Ground Zero September 12, 2001, said: “Feeling the heat, seeing the molten steel, the layers upon layers of ash, like lava, it reminded me of Mt. St. Helen’s and the thousands who fled that disaster.”</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.jhsph.edu/Publications/Special/Welch.htm">In late fall 2001, Dr. Alison Geyh of the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health reported: “Fires are still actively burning and the smoke is very intense. In some pockets now being uncovered, they are finding molten steel.”</a></li>
<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130730103131/http://911encyclopedia.com/wiki/index.php/Publication:20121014014812">Joe Allbaugh, the Director of FEMA, said in an October 2001 interview on CBS: “It’s just too hot for rescuers to get into [some] areas. So we do not know yet what’s in those areas, other than very hot, molten material.”</a></li>
<li>Dr. Keith Eaton reported in Structural Engineer: “They showed us many fascinating slides . . . ranging from molten metal which was still red hot weeks after the event, to 4-inch thick steel plates sheared and bent in the disaster.”</li>
<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060818074723/http:/pqasb.pqarchiver.com/nydailynews/87451160.html?did=87451160&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=FT&amp;date=Nov+1,+2001&amp;author=GREG+GITTRICH+DAILY+NEWS+STAFF+WRITER&amp;pub=New+York+Daily+News&amp;desc=FIRE+MAY+SMOLDER+FOR+MONTHS">Don Carson, a hazardous materials expert from the National Operating Engineers Union, said six weeks after 9/11: “There are pieces of steel being pulled out from as far as six stories underground that are still cherry red.”</a></li>
<li><a href="http://imgur.com/CCqRzAo">OSHA respond to the underground fires and potential steam explosions</a><br/></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Underground fires burned at temperatures up to 2,000 degrees. As the
huge cranes pulled steel beams from the pile, safety experts worried about the
effects of the extreme heat on the crane rigging and the hazards of contact with the
hot steel. And they were concerned that applying water to cool the steel could cause
a steam explosion that would propel nearby objects with deadly force. Special
expertise was needed. <strong>OSHA called in Mohammad Ayub and Scott Jin, structural
engineers from its national office, to assess the situation. They recommended a
special handling procedure, including the use of specialized rigging and instruments.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Testimony from Other Credible Witnesses:</strong></p>

<hr/>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://gcn.com/articles/2002/09/09/handheld-app-eased-recovery-tasks.aspx">Greg Fuchek, vice president of a company that supplied computer equipment used to identify human remains, reported that “sometimes when a worker would pull a steel beam from the wreckage, the end of the beam would be dripping molten steel.”</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.sas.upenn.edu/sasalum/newsltr/summer2002/k911.html">Sarah Atlas, of New Jersey’s Task Force One Urban Search and Rescue, arrived at Ground Zero on September 11 and reported that “fires burned and molten steel flowed in the pile of ruins still settling beneath her feet.”</a></li>
<li>Tom Arterburn, writing in Waste Age, reported that the New York Department of Sanitation removed “everything from molten steel beams to human remains</li>
<li>Mayor Rudy Giuliani acknowledged the extreme temperatures on site (awaiting good source)</li>
<li>NY Governor George Pataki also acknowledged the extreme temperatures (awaiting good source)</li>

<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1WWAnCd_6lg">Evidence of fused molten metal and concrete</a> of extreme heat.</p>

<hr/>

<p>The fact that the rubble contained steel or iron that had been melted shows that the buildings were destroyed by something other than fire and airplane impact.</p>

<p>When all of this physical evidence is combined with the testimony about explosions from many types of professionals, the claim that the Twin Towers were brought down by nothing other than the airplane impacts and resulting fires is simply not credible</p>

<p>I would object to the data being poorly collected. If so it would be simply impossible to create an independant model, but that happened. When Aegis Insurance was investigating to attempt to prove neglect, NIST&#39;s findings (ie WTC7&#39;s collapse) were all corroborated under oath by several preeminent experts (e.g., Guy Nordenson, Joseph P.

<p>The extrinsic data is there. To say the least, a model that produces a fire induced collapse, and one that shows a thermite controlled demolition would be <em>drastically</em> different.

    <div class="md"><p>The NIST report omitted crucial evidence and ignored standard investigation protocol.  Whatever <em>you</em> want does not change this fact. Here is the proof that the NIST report is flawed and there must be a new one conducted to answer the questions from that day.</p>

<p>They will not release their model data for peer review — therefore it is invalid. </p>

<p>Fraud? — <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/301e6t/breaking_news_nist_maintains_that_wtc_7_collapsed/">NIST maintains that WTC 7 collapsed due to fire acting upon the 13th floor &amp; A2001 girder. But — NIST omitted flange-to-web stiffeners on the south end of the girder A2001. These omitted stiffeners would prevent the girder flange from folding when the girder web moved beyond the seat.</a></p>

<p>Fraud? — <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/30mmj3/911_coverup_nist_says_shear_studs_were_not_used/">They also said shear studs were not used on WTC 7 girders — and claim the 13th floor A2001 girder was pushed off its seat at column 79 by &#39;thermally expanded&#39; beams. If shear studs had been used on the girders, it would have been impossible for the beams to push the girder off its seat.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. They rigged a building that sat separate from the two they were going to hit with planes for implosion. On the off chance that some debris hit WTC7 from the other two. Then let the fires burn for seven hours (let&#39;s hope it doesn&#39;t ignite that uber secret nano-thermite there lads!) before bringing down a building in the most impressive manner ever seen. </p>

<p>And the reason WTC7 had to come down? Documents. Ha. AHAHAHAH. Apparently its easier to smuggle and fit thousands of kilos of thermite into an office building, than to remove super secret original documents from one. </p>

<p>Your Truther movement is dying. And its because of fuckwits like you.

    <div class="md"><p>Great post. Before anyone tries to &quot;debunk&quot; this claiming some crap like a hydrogen reaction kept the heat up, take a look at this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the WPI metallurgical study of WTC steel done for the FEMA investigation, which indeed found steel had melted by eutectic reactions, which caused &quot;intergranular melting capable of turning a solid steel girder into Swiss cheese.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen this evidence before and the science is pretty weak.
The evidence they use comes from a paper they reference, but misconstrued:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rapid deterioration of the steel was a result of heating with oxidation in combination with intergranular melting due to the presence of sulfur. The formation of the eutectic mixture of iron oxide and iron sulfide lowers the temperature at which liquid can form in this steel. This strongly suggests that the temperatures in this region of the steel beam approached ~1,000ºC, forming the eutectic liquid by a process similar to making a “blacksmith’s weld” in a hand forge.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was from the rubble of WTC 7 that had uncontrolled fires, the scientists concluded that the &quot;section&quot; of the beam sustained temperatures [that are well within building fire temps.]
Also one article is about the twin towers and the metallurgy was from WTC 7, not to mention the page inserts it&#39;s own statements alongside quoted results form the paper, which is extremely disingenuous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Weak science? Actual data compared to mere conjecture? The beams were turned into swiss cheese.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot more than that one paper too as far as evidence for thermitic material being used:</p>

<p>Much of the evidence in the above well sourced link points to very hot temperatures long before the buildings collapsed, and clearly points to a source of the heating as something other than hydrogen/steam heating <strong>as it is clear that ridiculously hot temperatures were in effect long before the time it would take for the building to heat up from the steam/hydrogen reaction.</strong> </p>

<p>That is the key.</p>

<p>Some defenders of the official government story claim that a hydrogen/steam reaction could have kept the heat up and that somehow explains away the massive amount of heat at the site.</p>

<p>Which would be a decent theory, except <strong>first responders had carbon nanotubes in their lungs, a sign of thermitic reactions</strong>.</p>

<p>So, even if this were theoretically possible, much higher temperatures were observed <strong>before the building collapse</strong> which clearly proves the theory false.

    <div class="md"><p>So uh, my question is, if the terrorists got guns onto the planes, why couldnt they have gotten, say, thermite? That would be easier to get onto the plane, and would do a tremendous amount of damage to the structure, therefore killing more. Why couldn&#39;t the terrorists planted something to melt the beams inside the building? It just doesn&#39;t make sense that we suspect our own government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen this evidence before and the science is pretty weak.</p>

<p>The evidence they use comes from a paper they reference, but misconstrued:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rapid deterioration of the steel was a result of heating with oxidation in combination with intergranular melting due to the presence of sulfur. The formation of the eutectic mixture of iron oxide and iron sulfide lowers the temperature at which liquid can form in this steel. This strongly suggests that the temperatures in this region of the steel beam approached ~1,000ºC, forming the eutectic liquid by a process similar to making a “blacksmith’s weld” in a hand forge.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was from the rubble of WTC 7 that had uncontrolled fires, the scientists concluded that the &quot;section&quot; of the beam sustained temperatures [that are well within building fire temps.]</p>

<p>Also one article is about the twin towers and the metallurgy was from WTC 7, not to mention the page inserts it&#39;s own <strong>statements alongside quoted results form the paper</strong>, which is extremely disingenuous.</p>

<p>Lastly there&#39;s no physics, it&#39;s chemistry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You say the science is weak...yet those are not the only tests done on the rubble that demonstrate extremely high temperatures. </p>

<p>You argue it&#39;s misconstrued because it was WTC7? Or because the authors insert their own statements?</p>

<p>Regardless of the answer, the problem is still the same. The reactions needed to turn steel into swiss cheese were not likely caused from hydrogen/steam heating.</p>

<p>If you really want to look at it from an unbiased perspective, look at all the other evidence for extremely hot temps/thermitic material SOON AFTER THE PLANE IMPACTS, which means NO TIME FOR HEAT BUILDUP which puts the hydrogen/steam theory to rest.</p>

<p>This one is particularly damning. You aren&#39;t going to have carbon nanotubes be found in first responders lungs from hydrogen/steam heating...I mean think critically for a moment:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Carbon nanotubes have been found in the WTC dust and in the lungs of 9/11 first responders. Formation of carbon nanotubes requires extremely high temperatures, specific metal catalysts, and carbon compounds exactly like those found in nanothermite formulations. Researchers have discovered that nanothermite produces the same kinds of carbon nanotubes. That finding has been confirmed by independent analysis in a commercial contract laboratory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well they may have the capability. </p>

<p>Do you know how a gamma / cyber knife works?  It&#39;s an array of emitters used in radiation therapy to blast primarily brain tumors, such that each small, low energy beam does not overly damage tissue upon entry.  The beams converge, their energies are summarized, and this destroy the tumor.</p>

<p>Now we have a lot of satellites out there that can emit EM on a variety of wavelengths.  <em>Perhaps like a microwave, the harmonic resonance frequency of the type of steel could be selected and emitted by an array of satellites, coordinated and focused on a single target, heating it up to the melting point of steel.  This could explain multiple points of failure where the single point of failure is clearly false.</em>  </p>

<p>I do not know that wavelength, but man if we find out it&#39;s in the range of mobile or radio frequencies, uh oh--hypothesis thus proposed.</p>

<p>So like the cyber knife, just for an example,  one could coordinate a satellite array (for example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridium_satellite_constellation">IRIDIUM 66 Satellite constellation</a>) to focus on a single target and affect it.</p>

<p>Of course IRIDIUM is only for mobile communications, to our knowledge there are no other &#39;capabilites&#39; that we are allowed to know about.</p>

<hr/>

<p>The melted cars were always an interesting thing.  This convergence hypothesis would also explain the melted cars on the street as EM leakage if there were a lack of a heat wave.  Or from the heat given off by the steel, although more evidence of a heat wave on the ground would surely have been observed and it wasn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Finally, for God&#39;s sake.  <strong><em>66</em></strong> satellites.  Sheesh.  You guys and your numerology.  Peter Levenda has to do an irish whisky shot every time they do something fucky like that.</p>

<p>From the wiki on partical beams;</p>

<p>Modern experiments</p>

<p>The U.S. Defense Strategic Defense Initiative put into development the technology of a neutral particle beam to be used as a weapon in outer space.[13] Neutral beam accelerator technology was developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory. As part of the Beam Experiments Aboard Rocket (BEAR) project, a prototype hydrogen beam weapon was launched from White Sands Missile Range in July 1989 and successfully deployed into low Earth orbit. It was operated successfully in space and after reentry was recovered intact. In 2006 the weapon prototype was transferred from Los Alamos to the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC.[14][15]</p>

<p>If it&#39;s blown with forced air or wind. Otherwise it does well to  just cook hamburgers.</p>

<p>Can you  point to any sustained  wind to force enough heat  within the burning  ( actually very quickly depleted)    kerosene  to weaken the steel?  </p>

<p>Here is countering evidence.</p>

<p>In the north tower for instance,  a  now well known lady with very long hair  was standing in the north towers most probable air inlet where the air should be rushing in past  her to feed the supposed but in no way verifiable inferno in the elevator shaft of that building  but her hair is not  being blown. by any such flow. </p>

<p>No such air flow is indicated in video from the lobby either.  The black smoke indicated an oxygen starved fire.  The smoke moved lazily.</p>

<p>The frame was cool enough for her to touch.</p>

<p>The air was cool enough  for Orio Palmer, in the south tower&#39;s 78th floor  to breathe and the only proof of any such steel weakening heat is the word of employees of known liars.</p>

<p>Here is  no wind,  not feeding an alleged inferno and not even  skin  burning heat in the buildings  frame.</p>

<p>Any &#39;evidence&#39; of steel weakening heat is just unsupported  theory that hopes to  support a wholly flawed government story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope. Factually incorrect. Roughly 1/3 or less was destroyed in initial impact/fires. We have endless testimony of elevators on fire and fires spreading into floors/lobbies via jet fuel. Factually we know the shafts were saturated with jet fuel and that it was on fire. The shafts became fuel repositories. This is confirmed/ well established physics, that massive heating will result. It&#39;s basically a jet fuel forge. The fires at top pull in and accelerate cool air from the bottom; carrying fuel vapor with it. Wind blowing at the top also assists, creating a low pressure at the top - like a chimney. Basically a poor turbocharger.  Same concept, though less effective, was used to burn alive the people in Waco.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Call it a thought experiment.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_Defense_Initiative">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_Defense_Initiative</a> has space based particle beams in the budget.</p>

<p>From the wiki on partical beams;</p>

<p>Modern experiments</p>

<p>The U.S. Defense Strategic Defense Initiative put into development the technology of a neutral particle beam to be used as a weapon in outer space.[13] Neutral beam accelerator technology was developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory. As part of the Beam Experiments Aboard Rocket (BEAR) project, a prototype hydrogen beam weapon was launched from White Sands Missile Range in July 1989 and successfully deployed into low Earth orbit. It was operated successfully in space and after reentry was recovered intact. In 2006 the weapon prototype was transferred from Los Alamos to the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC.[14][15]</p>

<p>So the military has a program that is a resounding success and then stops all work on said program? Not likely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well they may have the capability. </p>

<p>Do you know how a gamma / cyber knife works?  It&#39;s an array of emitters used in radiation therapy to blast primarily brain tumors, such that each small, low energy beam does not overly damage tissue upon entry.  The beams converge, their energies are summarized, and this destroy the tumor.</p>

<p>Now we have a lot of satellites out there that can emit EM on a variety of wavelengths.  <em>Perhaps like a microwave, the harmonic resonance frequency of the type of steel could be selected and emitted by an array of satellites, coordinated and focused on a single target, heating it up to the melting point of steel.  This could explain multiple points of failure where the single point of failure is clearly false.</em>  </p>

<p>I do not know that wavelength, but man if we find out it&#39;s in the range of mobile or radio frequencies, uh oh--hypothesis thus proposed.</p>

<p>So like the cyber knife, just for an example,  one could coordinate a satellite array (for example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridium_satellite_constellation">IRIDIUM 66 Satellite constellation</a>) to focus on a single target and affect it.</p>

<p>Of course IRIDIUM is only for mobile communications, to our knowledge there are no other &#39;capabilites&#39; that we are allowed to know about.</p>

<hr/>

<p>The melted cars were always an interesting thing.  This convergence hypothesis would also explain the melted cars on the street as EM leakage if there were a lack of a heat wave.  Or from the heat given off by the steel, although more evidence of a heat wave on the ground would surely have been observed and it wasn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Finally, for God&#39;s sake.  <strong><em>66</em></strong> satellites.  Sheesh.  You guys and your numerology.  Peter Levenda has to do an irish whisky shot every time they do something fucky like that.</p>
