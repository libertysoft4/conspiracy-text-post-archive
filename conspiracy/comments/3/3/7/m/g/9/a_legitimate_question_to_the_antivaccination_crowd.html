<p>From my personal experience, I can&#39;t find any real evidence that vaccines are bad.  The only things I find that are against vaccinations are blog posts that source nothing, or themselves.  Every piece of anti vaccination info I see seems to be debunked fairly easily.  I know people in healthcare who are passionately pro vaccination due to the horrible issues that occur because of people not being vaccinated.</p>

<p>Can someone please tell me why you are, or why people in general are anti vaccination?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im from a country that doesnt really give a toss about vaccination, unlike the obsession the US seems to have with it.</p>

<p>I think, in this sub or for me at least, the opposition to vaccinations is more to do with distrust for the government and particular wealthy individuals, who often seem to be involved with eugenics, and are big players in the pharmaceutical industry.</p>

<p>The people in this sub understand the extent of government corruption, even if we often take the mistrust too far and appear to think everything is a conspiracy. Fact is, they are corrupt, and many of them think of us poor people as viruses, using all the resources that should belong to the rich.</p>

<p>With that in mind, you can see why we dont want to trust these people with things they inject directly into our bloodstream. We see fertility decreasing in humans, cancer rates increasing, and considering our knowledge that many of these big players want to get rid of us, we look at how to limit our exposure to their influence.</p>

<p>We see the current massive social media campaign supporting vaccinations as government supported propaganda. They want to make anti-vaxxers like scum, like absolute evil. By doing so, the general population become the police, and will put pressure on these anti-vaxxers to &#39;conform&#39;. Eventually, this could lead to the government &#39;suggesting&#39; that vaccinations are mandatory for all citizens, and of course the people would think this is great. In reality, this is a corrupt governments wet dream. A direct line to inject 100% of the people with whatever you want.</p>

<p>I mean, I know vaccinations work. So long as they&#39;re not contaminated, which history has shown they sometimes are, which can result in death. I know it works, but I&#39;d rather just take my chances with the measles rather than giving up my human right to not be injected with something. Getting measles used to be just a normal part of growing up.</p>

<p>Why is such a big deal made of it in the US? Are there not more pressing problems in society? Are un-vaccinated people killing millions of people or something? How about a big social campaign against drunk drivers? Or, why not a big social campaign against those wars you have constantly been involved in for decades, which are achieving nothing except lining the pockets of your corps, killing thousands of young US soldiers, and millions upon millions of innocent citizens of the middle east. How about a big social pressure campaign against a real issue like that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>(just to advise, I am not from the US, currently live in Australia, which is also having the same multi headline situation with Vaccinations.  Recently programs such as cutting welfare for those who don&#39;t vaccinate, and not allowing Religious reasons for non vaccination)</p>

<p>I understand the mistrust, I subscribe to this sub for that reason.  I don&#39;t like a lot of what the government(s) do.  But protecting it&#39;s citizens from diseases that are now curable makes total sense.  Yes, Measles used to be part of everyday life, it lead to serious horrible long term effects on people.  Nowadays, it doesn&#39;t have to be.  Same as Polio, Whooping Cough etc.  We have the science to make these diseases disappear.</p>

<p>There are contamination yes, this happens.  It happens in food too.  Cars get recalled all the time for faulty parts.  The situation is not full proof.  </p>

<p>I agree with you completely on the things you list at the bottom of your post.  There should be social outrage against the wars our constantly governments rage.  I think many are so passionate about the vaccination thing because it effects children.  When my child might die because you refuse to listen to Doctors and Scientists and prevent them from getting diseases that should have been cured years ago, all because you read some blog or facebook post, I can understand the reason people are passionate</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So fucking what if a parent tells you their kid had an adverse reaction to a vaccination. You have <em>nothing</em> other than their own <em>anecdotally-based belief</em> that their child&#39;s illness has <em>anything</em> to do with vaccinations. But let&#39;s say it&#39;s true. Let&#39;s say that that parent&#39;s child got sick from a vaccination. No medical procedure is 100% effective and without risk. If one child gets sick from a vaccination then that&#39;s a personal tragedy. But this ignores the <em>millions</em> of people for whom there were no adverse reactions that are protected from some of the worst diseases that humanity has ever faced <em>because</em> of that vaccination. The life of your child is not as valuable as the combined lives of the millions of other children you wilfully put at risk based on half-digested stupidity.</p>

<p>You have a higher chance of being struck by lightning, or having your entire family wiped out in a car crash, than your child has of  getting even slightly sick from vaccinations. Your children are in far, <em>far</em>, greater danger of injury or death while you drive them to the doctor&#39;s office than they are from the jab you are so fearful of. And yet you don&#39;t think twice about driving your kids everywhere and you&#39;re more than willing to justify <em>why</em> you are willing to put your children in such constant danger because you <em>heard</em> that someone <em>said</em> that they <em>think</em> their child <em>might have</em> gotten sick from a vaccination. If you drive a car, you have absolutely no leg to stand on when arguing about vaccinations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only time your child is at risk is until they can get vaccinated at what, 1.5 years old?</p>

<p>So, simple solution - dont take your child to daycare until they are 1.5 years old if you are paranoid about it. If you have to work so daycare is not an option, dont have a child. Dont force me to succumb to an injection I dont want, just because you want convenience for 1.5 years of your life. </p>

<p>How many people die as a result of anti-vaxxers? Is the outrage worth the overwhelming media coverage? Or is this like the war on terror? Destroying all of our freedoms in order to save a tiny, yet overrepresented group of people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Poor little Rhett Krawitt, desperately wants to get vaccinations but hes just too sick to get them... hes evidently not sick enough to keep in bed or keep home from school, but he is too sick to get 50 vaccinations like most kids get. Poor little Rhett desperately needs YOU to get vaccinated so HE can go about his life unmolested by harmful vaccinations. This NON STORY was covered by all the major media outlets, which is always the first clue that its just bullshit propaganda. Compare the number of search results at news.google.com for Rhett Krawitt with the number of search results for Dr William Thompson or Dr Brian Hooker, then ask yourself why the media carries this bullshit fluff piece and ignores the real story. #DrWakefieldWasRight</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s true. There isn&#39;t anything inherently trustworthy about the people that publish these papers. What people tend to find trustworthy is the process that roots out papers that are unjustifiable or not reproducible by peers who seek to apply the findings. The people that tend to believe in anti-vaccination theories, that they cause autism for instance, also tend to think there is a conspiracy in science to keep these findings out of the light. Thus, we can cite good solid science papers on the topic all day long but if they think scientists or the journals that publish them are not trustworthy, all that effort isn&#39;t going to do anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People will naturally trust things they agree with, so of course skeptics are going to want to trust things that indicate falseness.  The most effective kind of lie is that which exhibits truth at its exterior.  But don&#39;t forget, this works both ways.  What it takes in real science to find truths is people who are willing to be convinced rather than people who are willing to convince.  This is especially why it is difficult to believe those who support vaccinations, as those who oppose vaccinations are more commonly those who are willing to look into the science and form their own conclusions.</p>

<p>In other words, don&#39;t discount the value of distrust, as it is wrong to confuse it with foolishness.  Being distrustful is not being unwilling to listen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s my take. There&#39;s a well known preservative in the vaccines known as thimerosal. This mercury-based chemical, which is known to be toxic, is injected into your blood stream. The scientists argue that only trace amounts of the chemical are used, and that it is not toxic/harmful in any way. </p>

<p>YET... they ultimately remove it from the vaccines for children and pregnant women. Everyone else gets the regular shit. My question is.. WHY?? </p>

<p>It must&#39;ve been removed from those vaccines for a reason. I get that &quot;normal adults&quot; are not as susceptible as pregnant women or children, but why not just remove it all together?! If you can do it for those vaccines, do it across the board and end all the autism controversy crap once and for all.</p>

<p>But.. so far, I haven&#39;t seen anyone be able to explain to me why they haven&#39;t completely removed this chemical.</p>

<p>The reason thimerosal was removed (if you believe their bullshit) wasnt because it was harmful, but to appease the wacky anti-vaxx crowd.</p>

<p>So now they use aluminum instead of thimerosal, which may be even more dangerous.</p>

<p>From my research, it does seem that the cumulative accumulation of thimerosal (heavy metal) is the most likely culprit in adverse reactions. When the vaccine industry fabricates research data to fit their &quot;safe and effective&quot; narrative, and fail to acknowledge much less address the problems with their products, it leaves the door wide open for anyone to say anything about their products. If they would acknowledge and/or address their problems, then the critics wouldnt have as much ammo to use against the vaccine industry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please stop spreading blatant falsehoods. Almost no vaccines have thimerosal in them any more. Anyone can request a single-dose syringe which has no mercury. The only ones that have mercury as a preservative are large multi-dose vials which might be sitting on a shelf for a long time. And even those have a miniscule amount of mercury, measured in micrograms (thousandths of a gram). Meanwhile the EPA limit for mercury in seafood is measured in grams. And it&#39;s not even the same type of mercury. This is just basic science that so many anti-vaxxers have not bothered to familiarize themselves with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not an advocate against vaccines, there is far too much evidence suggesting successful use of them than against.  What I am against is these giant corporations making these vaccinations.  There is no transparency (which is huge since we should know <strong>exactly</strong> what is being injected into us) to these corporations and there is no such thing as a clinical trial anymore; meaning they are testing these products on the general population without knowing if there are any long-term side effects.  None of us deserve to be treated like test rats.</p>

<p>There are some vaccines (mumps, polio, rubella, etc.) that have a good track record and have established results.  Then there are vaccines like last years flu vaccine which was only 3% effective on adult over 65.  Why is that acceptable?  Also we need to educate the general public (without <strong>any</strong> scare-mongering) about all aspects of vaccinations.  </p>

<p>I grew up listening to my grandmother talk about her baby brother getting polio, and what he went through. To me it seems foolish to take a chance on your kids getting something like this that can kill or or seriously injure them.</p>

<p>Same goes for MMR, because of the complications &amp; lifelong injury that can arise from having those diseases.</p>

<p>That said... I refuse to give my kids anything that hasn&#39;t been on the market for a long time and thoroughly tested - or that there isn&#39;t a strong motivation for doing so. My MIL nearly stroked out over me refusing to give my kids the rushed-to-market swine flu vaccination that was already causing problems. My daughter isn&#39;t getting gardisil.</p>

<p>As a funny aside, I used the religious exemptions paperwork to side-step a bullying school nurse who wanted one of my kids to have an unnecessary polio vacc because we had formerly lived in a different state that gave it on a different schedule - and wanted my second child to be rushed through his (newly required) Hep A series faster than would allow for proper immunity, according to my doctor.</p>

<p><strong>People like her are the reason I&#39;m not in favor of forced vaccinations.</strong> It gave me great pleasure to sign that slip of paper and basically tell her to go to hell.</p>

<p>Imagine you see these kids everyday for their first year of their lives, you notice the growth, eye contact, interaction, playing, starting to formulate words and decisions, laughter, emotions.......and then the very next day after the shots, subtle things start changing and within 2-4 weeks, they no longer look you in the eyes, the behavior changes, they can&#39;t stand loud sounds, won&#39;t eat the same foods they used to.</p>

<p>And then I&#39;m demonized on reddit for having witnessed this and speaking about it. Now I also have a cousin who also seems to be going through the same thing with her son. For some reason, the boys are more susceptible because of a weaker blood brain barrier.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right. Because all of those reported cases of Sudden Onset Neurodegeneration immediately after vaccination are just a coincidence. The real culprit is those pesky parents with bad genes producing defective children, which just happens fo manifest itself immediately after vaccination. </p>

<p>I take it you&#39;ve never bothered to listen to why Dr Wakefield started researching links between vaccines and autism in the first place. If you had, youd know it was because he saw first hand the cause (vaccines) and effect (Neurodegeneration). </p>

<p>And remember kids, theres no scientific evidence linking cigarettes to cancer. At least thats what big tobacco told the US congress. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Vaccinations are not necessary for health, as the diseases they supposedly eradicated were already sitting at very low rates before their introduction anyways such as polio, measles, smallpox etc.</p>

<p>The statistics conclusively prove that disease was wiped out by higher health standards, not vaccines.</p>

<p>So, there really isn&#39;t much need for them for one.</p>

<p>Example A: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/eD61Ag5.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/eD61Ag5.jpg</a>  </p>

<p>Further statistics: <a href="https://childhealthsafety.wordpress.com/graphs/">https://childhealthsafety.wordpress.com/graphs/</a></p>

<p>You combine that with the fact that vaccine ingredients such as aluminum, squalene, aborted fetal tissue, and other such things are known to be toxic (aluminum) or cause auto immune disorders (squalene, look up gulf war syndrome). </p>

<p>Essentially, the adjuvants train the immune system to attack it&#39;s own cells as part of the stimulation required for vaccines to work. The side effects of this vary, but obviously can be damaging. </p>

<p>So to summarize:</p>

<ol>
<li>Not necessary.</li>
<li>Known to cause harmful side effects, including (in the most extreme examples) death.</li>
</ol>

<p>Also vaccine manufacturers blackmailed the US congress in the 80s, and are now immune from being held liable from damages caused by their products. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.nvic.org/NVIC-Vaccine-News/March-2011/No-Pharma-Liability--No-Vaccine-Mandates-.aspx">http://www.nvic.org/NVIC-Vaccine-News/March-2011/No-Pharma-Liability--No-Vaccine-Mandates-.aspx</a></p>

<p>A good exceprt on squalene:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>With the use of special additives called adjuvants, manufacturers are able to increase the number of possible doses that can be made on time for the fall flu season. But though there are many safe adjuvants which can be added, they are adding one - squalene, which has been shown to cause prolonged systemic immune response against the squalene itself, which results in reduced fertility, reduced intellect and reduced life span.</p>

<p>Squalene is an important molecule in the body. It is a precursor to many different oils and hormones, and is needed for proper brain function, fertility and also plays an important role in protecting cells from aging and mutation. Anything which affects your natural squalene can have a major negative impact on your health.</p>

<p>Because the squalene will be injected in the presence of a pathogen during the H1N1 vaccination, it will cause an immune response against not only the pathogen, but to the squalene itself. Squalene is a precursor molecule which is essential for the production of many hormones including all of the male and female sexual hormones. Squalene is also a precursor to many of the neurochemical receptors prevalent in the nervous system and when the immune system is programmed to attack squalene, it causes irreversible neuronal and neuromuscular damage which can range from a loss of intellect and autism to more serious disorders such as Lou Gehrig&#39;s disease and systemic autoimmune diseases and possibly brain tumors.</p>

<p>In independent studies where squalene laced vaccines were injected into guinea pigs, the resultant autoimmune disorders killed 14 out of 15. A later test, to verify the results had the same outcome.</p>

<p>When first injected via the anthrax vaccine in Gulf War 1, it permanently disabled many of the soldiers who received it, due to the effects now known as the Gulf War Syndrome. 95 percent of the soldiers who recieved the anthrax vaccine have been found to have antibodies to squalene. Few of the soldiers who recieved the vaccine remained healthy and do not have the antibodies whether or not they were deployed. None of the soldiers who did not receive the vaccine have the antibodies, even those who fought in Iraq. Squalene antibody related deaths total 6.5 percent of the vaccinated group.</p>

<p><strong>It takes approximately a year for the effects to fully manifest themselves because that much time passes before the nervous system and brain deplete the reserves of Squalene that are out of the reach of the immune system and only after the reserves are gone will cell injury begin. This takes the pressure off vaccine manufacturers who deny any wrongdoing for a response so delayed. And with Congress passing legislation granting immunity to any corporations who cause damage with their vaccines, the outlook is evermore dark.</strong></p>

<p>After examining the components of the H1N1 flu vaccine we can only conclude that it is not intended to treat the flu at all, quite differently, it is intended to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Reduce intelligence </li>
<li>Reduce life span </li>
<li>Reduce fertility </li>
<li>Cause numerous deaths</li>
</ol>

<p>For if it was intended for any other purpose, Squalene and other adjuvants beyond the scope of this article would not be present. Furthermore, the scope of this article only covers squalene, and we believe that because there are so many ways to induce autoimmune responses equally devastating via other injectable formulations coupled with the obviously intentional shipment of a pandemic by Baxter that the credibility of vaccines is forever tainted and the trust in the greater medical community may have been irreparably broken. Baxter should be out of business, the fact that they are not is damning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of the studies done on vaccinations are short term studies focusing only on specific aspects.</p>

<p>But before you flip the script on me, how about you address my points first.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say even if they are safe and effective.</p>

<p>They aren&#39;t necessary whatsoever, as the graphs in my links above show.</p>

<p>And more importantly, they aren&#39;t &quot;safe and effective&quot; whatsoever as the SIDS correlation quite clearly shows.</p>

<p>The US has the highest rates of vaccinations among newborns, and also has the highest infant mortality.</p>

<p>SIDS shows clear neurodegeneration, and is always right after heavy vaccination. </p>

<p>I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re not going to address that are you?</p>

<p>Regardless of the negative downsides of vaccines, the most important point is that they are not necessary for health WHATSOEVER as the graphs show, and even if the pro vaxxers are to be believed...STILL carry possible risks of side effects.</p>

<p>A 6 year old could do the logic on this one.</p>

<li>Not necessary at all.</li>
<li>Carries risks. </li>
<li>What to do what to do...</li>

<p>Let&#39;s say that that&#39;s true. So what? Should we just ignore all of modern medicine since soap, water, and indoor plumbing were invented?

<p>I have hundreds too. Not that it matters, quality is more important. We can spend months debating specifics of scientific papers, or we can get to the more relevant issue, which is that vaccines are <strong>entirely unneeded, and in some cases actively harmful</strong>. </p>

<p>For all the posting you do, all the personal attacks, and the armchair expert you pretend to be, <strong><em>you still cannot address the fact that vaccines are not the cause for drops in disease rates and mortality even though the data is clear on this.</em></strong> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I posted this on another thread:</p>

<p>I think what I am trying to say, is that the individuals who say that vaccines cause autism in children claim that their children suffered a reaction from the vaccination. Even if a million children were vaccinated it is only a small majority that have bad reactions, let&#39;s say 100 children, and of those who have bad reaction it&#39;s an even smaller number that are CLAIMED to have then went on to develop some type of autistic disorder. So I don&#39;t think the number would be higher. </p>

<p>All in all, the general consensus is that, these children must be put at risk for the greater good. This of course is because of the belief that vaccines are the only way to protect humanity from certain death. I have other points on that issue. </p>

<p>I read a book that detailed the history of vaccinations. Interestingly enough, when inoculation, as it was called, was first developed in the Ottoman Empire and then started to spread in the West, the idea of germs was debated. Instead, top medical theories at the time believed that diseases traveled around invisible cloud. So the idea of inoculation and later vaccinations were seen as a way to prevent these invisible clouds of disease from infecting people. Obviously, this was not accurate. </p>

<p>No studies were ever conducted and throughout the 1700 and 1800 when vaccinations were widespread, disease still persisted with spikes happening ever few decades and a new round of vaccines were introduced, follow by a spike of infected and mortality rates which would then shrink again, probably because those infected had died out or become immune from having survived being infected and had antibodies, but others see these periods of decrease of mortality as being because of mass inoculations. </p>

<p>Now, when we look at the data, most of the serious disease were wiped out from the Western world beginning around the early 1900s into the 1970s. Obviously vaccines are touted for the eradication of such diseases. This is a fine correlation, which it is, as the causal nature as never been scientifically established as the studies done with vaccinations do not permit a control group. </p>

<p>During the early 1900s, the theory of germs began to become more widely accepted. This also led to widespread hygiene movements. Muckrackers, as they were called, were busy exposing problems with the food industry and the squalor that urban people were experiencing with cramped tenanments and improper waster removal. </p>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, NYC in the 1800 and early 1900s was very dirty. People lived amongst garbage and waste. Drinking water was infected with human and animal feceses. Dozens of people were crammed into living conditions and both adults and children worked 16 hour days for six or seven days a week. These kinds of conditions would result in weakened immune systems. Disease and infections, along with death rates were high. </p>

<p>Once hygienic policies began to be implemented we can see that there is a correlated decrease with diseases such as polio, whooping cough and measles. </p>

<p>Take polio for example - for one, the widespread fears of polio were often hyped by sensationalized media. We can maybe compare polio to diseases such as SARS or Ebola. Not that polio was not a terrible disease, it just was not on the same level as the common flu, which even today kills millions of people a year. </p>

<p>Polio also saw its most significant decrease followed by the banning of DDT in America. Interestingly enough, the two countries where polio still thrives despite widespread vaccinations is India and China were DDT is most widely used in Industrial countries. </p>

<p>DDT has been known to cause neurological impatients similar to that seen in polio. Go figure, in America, polio was often associated with the arrival of spring, which was when DDT was mostly used to protect crops. </p>

<p>I can continue going on but that is just some relative information I can pull off the top of my head. There is plenty of reputable information from scientist which is often repressed due to this fear that people have about disease and the dogmatic belief that vaccinations are the only way to prevent widespread pandemics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The court ruled it. The author of that forbes article might have decent points to make, the court ruling may not be accurate, but they still ruled it.</p>

<p>Regardless, the point is the same. Vaccines do not DIRECTLY cause autism, but the neruodegeneration that they cause (look up the correlation between SIDS and neurodegeneration) leads to autism in the kids that react the worst with vaccines.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re really curious, look up the correlation. US has toughtest infant vaccine schedule, also has highest rates of SIDS. Among populations with less or no vaccines, SIDS is less of an issue, or non existent whatsoever. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right I should have posted my previous comment. It was on a thread about people pro-vaccinations never want to have a discussion about vaccines. </p>

<p>I had started of by saying that there is no proof that vaccines, or rather the chemicals in vaccinations have any correlated or causal relationship to causing developmental disorders. </p>

<p>But, I have often wondered if there could be an asymptomatic side effect to vaccinations in some children that could cause them to develop autism. Here is that post:</p>

<p>&quot;I don&#39;t believe that vaccinations cause autism directly. But for example, I was on science a few weeks back and a doctor had chimed in about vaccinations. I had wanted to discuss the autistic link. </p>

<p>In this regard, there are plenty of developmental studies that have shown babies and young children who get high fevers are at risk for developmental issues. This has been documented countless times and the correlation is positive. Hence, vaccinations are important because you do not want children to get the flu or run fevers because this can lead to death or injuries. Everyone can be in agreement with this. </p>

<p>Now, a side effect that vaccinations have in some children, is that they temporarily make them run high fevers. In a minority of these cases, the children become sick enough to require medical attention. This is also a fact and is attested by doctors and vaccination companies. </p>

<p>My concern is, what is the possibility that vaccines in some children can be linked to autism, but as a atypical side effect, that being in causing raised temperature and other flu induced symptoms? </p>

<p>I have read the autistic links from vaccinations and most studies just focus on the chemicals and how they affect cells or mammals. But I have not read anything in this regard, and am curious to know if maybe what parents saw as developmental problems developing after a series of vaccinations were administered might be related to side effects. In fact, many of the anecdotal stories of parents claiming the link say their child became sick before showing sings of autism. </p>

<p>I have tried countless times having a discussion with people on reddit claiming to be specialist, and instead of explaining it, I am ignored. </p>

<p>I have a few other concerns regarding vacations and their efficacy but am not going to delve into them here right now. Suffice to say from the knowledge I have gathered, I do not walk around living in fear of unvaccinated people like most of the herd seem to do.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you mean theres no proof that vaccines are linked to developmental disorders?</p>

<p>Dr Wakefield (and a dozen co-authors) got research published in a peer reviewed journal that showed just that...</p>

<p>Now you might say that Dr Wakefield is a fraud who lost his license, which might be true. However, if its true that Dr Wakefield was able to publish fraudulent research in a peer reviewed journal, it makes you wonder why anyone should believe anything in any peer reviewed journal.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the &quot;research&quot; debunking Dr Wakefield itself was shown to be fraudulent by CDC whistleblower Dr William Thompson.</p>

<p>So basically the two landmark studies on links between vaccines and autism both contradict each other, and both have been accused of being frauds...</p>

<p>And the third party parent who just wants to protect their kids is supposed to make intelligent, informed decisions by relying on all this fabricated science? </p>

<p>At this point i dont really care who is right. The whole thing stinks to high heaven and i want nothing to do with vaccines. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi. I am not against vaccines but i recently thought i would look into why anti-vaxxers don&#39;t want to get vaccinated. Contrary to mainstream media reports vaccines have and still do cause injury. Plus research has suggested some other weird side effects and underhanded deals. Anyway I wrote an article on it and provided all the references that outline, at least what i believe to be, sound reasons for not vaccinating. I can certainly sympathize with anti-vaxxers and as a result of my research have decided that i am anti- mandatory vaccinations. Here is a link to the article:

<p>I disagree with the anti-vax movement pretty vigorously, but can understand why some people might be cagey about being injected with stuff they might not understand. Some anti-vaxers have valid concerns about vaccine toxicity and side-effects which shouldn&#39;t be ignored or mocked or sidelined, but investigated.</p>

<p>In the end, though, I feel vaccines are a major contributing factor to modern human life span and well-being throughout the course of life. I trust &#39;em, and view them as one of our great medical advances.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why not both? :p</p>

<p>I should quantify my previous statement by adding that there are some vaccines I simply don&#39;t trust, based on personal research. For example, I skip the much-advertised annual flu shot - not because of fear of side effects, but because the shots are increasingly ineffective, and flu isn&#39;t really a threat at my age. I think last year&#39;s dose had a reported 12% effectiveness. Pass.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People are generally anti-vaccine because they erroneously conflate the overwhelming safe medical technology of vaccination with the evil pharmaceutical companies which are currently our only source of vaccines. In other words, they are confusing a medical/scientific issue with a political/economic one. And they generally just don&#39;t know what they&#39;re talking about. 90% of the time you&#39;ll see them railing on about mercury, which isn&#39;t in the vast majority of vaccines anymore (and for those that do still have it, I&#39;d love for anyone to show me proof that 25 <em>micrograms</em> of mercury is a significant risk for anything harmful).  </p>

<p>Anti-vaccination advocacy is an example of a more general trend among less rigorous conspiracy theorists. I call it &quot;Opposite Day Syndrome&quot;. Since some conspiracy theories are true, they reason, all conspiracy theories must be true. Basically the truth must be the opposite of whatever is mainstream, be that on vaccines, global warming, the moon landing, or the holocaust. So just let me cautious you against assuming that everyone who thinks, for example, that the government is lying about 9/11, also thinks that vaccines are bad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>False, people are anti vaccine because they are not necessary, and obviously have a risk of side effects.</p>

<p>There is no reason to vaccinate if you are healthy. Also, vaccinated individuals shed live viruses, thus endangering unhealthy people...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t report it, but it was probably removed for personal attacks which is rule breaking. I see you still haven&#39;t learned your lesson.</p>

<p>On a side note, it&#39;s always a sign that the debate is over when someone has to resort to personal attacks when the data proves them wrong. </p>
