<p>Even if our leaders are machiavellian war mongers, we still have a much better quality of life than the rest of the world, right? And we&#39;re definitely the most free. </p>

<p>It&#39;s important, though, to remember that North Koreans <em>think the exact same thing</em>. </p>

<p>There&#39;s no way we could be so brainwashed as to believe we are free, when we&#39;re really living in a prison, right? Again, North Koreans by and large <strong>love</strong> their government, and considered Kim Jong-il <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/north-korean-defector-says-she-believed-kim-jongil-was-a-god-who-could-read-her-mind-9251983.html">a god</a>. </p>

<p>For me, the evidence is starting to stack up. The media is controlled, and probably entirely fake. Almost every war starts with a false flag. I can literally <em>feel</em> how TV shows and commercials brainwash you into passivity. </p>

<p>On some level, of course it&#39;s like this. Everything is interconnected, and those with the strongest, most ruthless mindsets are going to be the ones who rise to the top of government. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s <em>all</em> phony. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi, I agree with your premise, but not in the notion that all North Koreans unconditionally revere the administration. I&#39;m a South Korean, who has met several NK refugees, who has family members that have visited North Korea, and can confidently say that this is largely a myth. Yes, the education and justice system promote this image, but it is not universally accepted, especially if you go into the rural areas. Like any large community, there are dissidents, dissenters, critical thinkers and even free thinkers. No amount of propaganda can encourage a large population of people living in unfavorable conditions (but, from what I&#39;ve learned over the course of my life, nothing near to what is cherry picked by western propaganda) to unconditionally accept an autocratic regime.</p>

<p>However, much of this dissent is suppressed because the NK regime has managed to instill in the populace a notion of a threat greater than the autocratic rulership, one that, in the minds of many, justifies and necessitates the status quo. This, of course, is the threat of America. That is why NK will not let up with its constant sabre rattling. None of the leadership actually believes this will make the western infidels &quot;shake in their boots&quot;. This is propaganda directed inwards, at their own people.</p>

<p>So, yes, in that way, US and NK are very similar. They both depend on the perceived notion of a foreign threat to maintain the status quo and criticize dissenters as being unpatriotic. The measures each state is willing to take to protect this status quo certainly differs, but given that the main witness to NK&#39;s &quot;human rights abuses&quot;, Shin Dong Hyuk, had to recant critical details in his testimony due to inherent inconsistencies, without sufficient explanation as to why such misinformation was necessary, this difference may not be as large as some people believe.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/north-korean-defector-shin-donghyuk-admits-inaccuracies-in-bestselling-tale-of-torture-escape-from-camp-14-9986571.html">http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/north-korean-defector-shin-donghyuk-admits-inaccuracies-in-bestselling-tale-of-torture-escape-from-camp-14-9986571.html</a></p>

<p>But I digress. I could go on and on about common misconceptions about NK (for example, Kim Jung Un wasn&#39;t always fat, was educated in Europe and was never the first choice to begin with. In fact, most South Koreans believe he was intentionally fattened and even underwent cosmetic surgery to resemble his grandfather, Kim Il Sung (of which, by the way, much evidence points towards being an imposter usurping the name of a Korean liberation milita general of the same name), and though I admit past photos show significant changes in appearance, I&#39;m not completely sold on that, simply because there isn&#39;t enough evidence. Try googling his past photos and judge for yourself)</p>

<p>But again, I digress. I told you I could go on and on.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The irony is that conspiracy theorists depend on the perceived notion of a governmental threat to maintain their status quo and criticize dissenters are being sheeple to a much, much greater extent than anything the US does and- insanely- maybe even more than the DPRK does.  They just don&#39;t have the ability to imprison people for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That analogy does not hold as it is a sweeping generalization. By &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; you could be talking about anybody from UFOlogists to members of congress demanding further investigation into Fast and Furious. I understand people repeat this over and over, but  to simply dismiss a notion based solely on the derogatory notion of the word &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; is a critical logical fallacy. On the other hand, criticism of certain functions of the government are directed towards a limited, finite structure that has a generally unified agenda.</p>

<p>To compare the use of a perceived notion to one&#39;s benefit is also a fallacy of generalization. By that logic, you could compare these two examples to the operation of the stock market (and even money itself) to be based on the participants&#39; perceived notion of the value of individual items/currencies. You could compare that to the perceived notion of an individual&#39;s skill when he markets it in the labor force. There is a difference of degree in how well these perceived notions can be empirically proven, but given the large umbrella of &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot;, the comparison you suggest (between said group and the US or NK) is impossible to validate. The use of perceived notions is not always assailable nor nefarious. It is quite universal, and is certainly not the only &quot;similarity&quot; between government misconduct and conspiracy theories decrying said behavior. But pointing out such general similarities does nothing to discredit the arguments of one side or the other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re missing the point. By that train of thought I could simply &#39;rebut&#39; by saying that you&#39;re using the same &quot;perceived notion&quot; regarding &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot;.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m saying is that &quot;perceived notion&quot; is only a different way of saying &quot;assertion with lack of empirical evidence.&quot; It doesn&#39;t matter which opinion seems more &quot;extreme&quot; because that point of view is completely objective. My point of view seems extreme to you, yours is perceived the same way to me.</p>

<p>What&#39;s important is how much empirical evidence supports each point of view, validating &quot;perceived notion&quot; as &quot;empirical fact&quot;. The point I&#39;m trying to make is that, yes, since &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; holds a wide variety of people under the same umbrella, a large faction within tends to jump to conclusions. However, when you look at evidence regarding certain hot button issues proposed by the government and by certain factions of &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; with more thoughtfully constructed assertions, the latter invariably presents more logically consistent arguments. This applies to much of the demonization propagated by the western authorities regarding North Korea.</p>

<p>In short, simply picking on a certain application of sophistry (the &quot;us vs them mentality&quot;, for example) and expounding that the same rule applies either way is not a constructive argument in any way. All sorts of logical fallacies apply to all sorts of &quot;viewpoints&quot; when you generalize. What you&#39;re implying is that all with what you consider a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; point of view adhere to there viewpoint simply due to a certain mentality. What I&#39;m saying is that no, a large faction adhere to certain veiwpoints based on logical deduction. To simply say that since certain people simply jump to conclusions based on an ideological belief, all others with similar viewpoints do the same in itself points towards an incredibly reductionist, oversimplified worldview.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what I was going for. I think all governments, at the high levels, want to have North Korea type power and it&#39;s only the people stopping this from happening totally. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That analogy does not hold as it is a sweeping generalization. By &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; you could be talking about anybody from UFOlogists to members of congress demanding further investigation into Fast and Furious. I understand people repeat this over and over, but  to simply dismiss a notion based solely on the derogatory notion of the word &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; is a critical logical fallacy. On the other hand, criticism of certain functions of the government are directed towards a limited, finite structure that has a generally unified agenda.</p>

<p>To compare the use of a perceived notion to one&#39;s benefit is also a fallacy of generalization. By that logic, you could compare these two examples to the operation of the stock market (and even money itself) to be based on the participants&#39; perceived notion of the value of individual items/currencies. You could compare that to the perceived notion of an individual&#39;s skill when he markets it in the labor force. There is a difference of degree in how well these perceived notions can be empirically proven, but given the large umbrella of &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot;, the comparison you suggest (between said group and the US or NK) is impossible to validate. The use of perceived notions is not always assailable nor nefarious. It is quite universal, and is certainly not the only &quot;similarity&quot; between government misconduct and conspiracy theories decrying said behavior. But pointing out such general similarities does nothing to discredit the arguments of one side or the other.</p>
