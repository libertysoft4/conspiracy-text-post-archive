<p>The large hadron collider will open a portal to hell</p>

<p>reptilian shapeshifters (although this one is <em>really</em> funny to me)</p>

<p>David Wilcock said that the rings of Saturn were really apartments for giant, 60 foot tall, aliens. They were made of strengthened aluminum that was clear like glass. Other aliens didn&#39;t like that they were living there and blew up their housing complex. That&#39;s why Saturn has rings. ಠ_ಠ </p>

<p>And I guess that&#39;s it... all the others have at least a shred of proof or plausibility. </p>

<p>Although 9/11 is clearly an inside job/controlled demolition, I don&#39;t think it was nukes, a beam from space or holographic planes. </p>

<p>You should (I suggest you) embrace the theory of maybe logic where all possibilities should be considered as potential realities. I like to give percentages of possibility between 0 and 100 to various theories based on the available evidence. </p>

<p>Was there foreknowledge, foul play, and prepared demolitions during the events of 9/11 - 95%</p>

<p>Is the earth hollow and inhabited by aliens? - .0864%</p>

<p>The &quot;Evil Genius Theory&quot; in philosophy (essentially we could be living in the Matrix) allows us to have a degree of uncertainty on the actual existence and truth of everything we perceive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have difficulty accepting things as being ideologically motivated when a profit motive is more convincingly applicable.</p>

<p>For example, 9/11. Is it about hiding and moving money, fomenting wars, creating an ideal business environment for the military industrial complex? Yes, of course. Was it a bizarre satanic ritual? I&#39;m inclined to say &#39;no&#39; at this point. I do entertain that it might have <em>also</em> been the case, but that aspect would have been incidental to it.</p>

<p>Also, I don&#39;t think most &quot;shills&quot; are actually shills. Not the ones that bother to actually debate things. Even in the JTRIG stuff, the instructions aren&#39;t to debate things vehemently – their instructions are to disrupt and derail, call people retarded and say they &quot;don&#39;t like the direction the sub is taking lately.&quot; Those are just people that have absorbed the lies as if they were truth. They sound like they must have set talking points because that&#39;s the information they&#39;ve formed their opinion around. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually some of the original manned Moon landings could be a fake (mainly the 1969 Apollo 11 one), due to Cold War propaganda (you know, the space-race between the USA and the USSR). Nobody knows for sure, it can be real too, but there are many dodgy things about it.</p>

<p>I think with the technology of nowadays it would be much more simple to implement a manned Moon landing successfully, but many things look really fake in the originals (e.g. no stars on high-quality space photos, shadows from multiple angles like in a studio, unexplainable objects, transparent astronauts). There were many other unmanned missions too, I think those really happened. And most probably the newer manned missions too. I know, there are some laser reflectors on the Moon, but they could be put there in unmanned or newer missions too: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Laser_Ranging_experiment">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Laser_Ranging_experiment</a></p>

<p>List of the landings:  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_landing">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_landing</a></p>

<p>Fun fact, Japan is planning a Moon landing to 2018, although an unmanned one:  <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2015/04/23/tech/japan-moon-lander-planned/">http://edition.cnn.com/2015/04/23/tech/japan-moon-lander-planned/</a></p>

<p>*edit: clarification</p>

<hr/>

<p>Some strange things about the original landings: <a href="http://listverse.com/2012/12/28/10-reasons-the-moon-landings-could-be-a-hoax/">http://listverse.com/2012/12/28/10-reasons-the-moon-landings-could-be-a-hoax/</a></p>

<p>Some additional strange stuff: <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/space/5780272/Moon-landing-anniversary-10-reasons-the-Apollo-landings-were-faked.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/space/5780272/Moon-landing-anniversary-10-reasons-the-Apollo-landings-were-faked.html</a></p>

<p>&quot;1) When the astronauts are putting up the American flag it waves. There is no wind on the Moon.</p>

<p>2) No stars are visible in the pictures taken by the Apollo astronauts from the surface of the Moon.</p>

<p>3) No blast crater is visible in the pictures taken of the lunar landing module.</p>

<p>4) The landing module weighs 17 tons and yet sits on top of the sand making no impression. Next to it astronauts’ footprints can be seen in the sand.</p>

<p>5) The footprints in the fine lunar dust, with no moisture or atmosphere or strong gravity, are unexpectedly well preserved, as if made in wet sand.</p>

<p>6) When the landing module takes off from the Moon’s surface there is no visible flame from the rocket.</p>

<p>7) If you speed up the film of the astronauts walking on the Moon’s surface they look like they were filmed on Earth and slowed down.</p>

<p>8) The astronauts could not have survived the trip because of exposure to radiation from the Van Allen radiation belt.</p>

<p>9) The rocks brought back from the Moon are identical to rocks collected by scientific expeditions to Antarctica.</p>

<p>10) All six Moon landings happened during the Nixon administration. No other national leader has claimed to have landed astronauts on the Moon, despite 40 years of rapid technological development.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>I do NOT believe:</strong> </p>

<p>► The basis of the anti-vaccination agenda (yep we need strict control and transparency regarding medical companies, but what are the alternatives, die due to bacterial and viral epidemics without vaccine protection, like it happened to millions of epidemics victims during the history?)</p>

<p>► Reptilian overlords (it does not seem to be probable, I mean if they would be so powerful they could just take control of the world overtly, but who knows, it cannot be falsified either)</p>

<p>► Chemtrails (seems to be a too overcomplicated theory; why not put mind-altering and body-influencing chemicals into the food instead if they want to control us that way, the food is full of additives anyway, so it would be way more simple and much more covert)</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>I DO believe:</strong> </p>

<p>► Aliens (there must be intelligent life in the huge universe with billions and billions of planets, stars and galaxies; although it is not sure if they can visit us, maybe they are too far, but hopefully we can make contact with them; a related equation which estimates the number of alien civilization to millions, although there are many unknown factors in it: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation</a>)</p>

<p>► 1% domination related theories (social inequality always existed in history and it is growing again, sadly; and the rich is always more powerful due to political lobbying, corruption and paid media-propaganda)</p>

<p>► For-profit wars (war is a racket, and weapon companies and their investors profit BILLIONS of $$$ from it; and of course they don&#39;t give a flying fuck about the thousands or even millions of innocent victims; check out this, a book by retired United States Marine Corps Major General and two time Medal of Honor recipient Smedley D. Butler: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Is_a_Racket">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Is_a_Racket</a>)</p>

<p>► Some spiritual theories like afterlife, soul, gods, intelligent beings in other dimensions  (nobody knows for sure of course, but if we were born in this life, it can happen again and again logically; also we have a very-very limited perception, so possibly we just cannot perceive other beings, just like an ant cannot understand the Internet or the theory of interplanetary space travel) ☺</p>

<p>I&#39;m aware of AE9/11 truth. But is that all? </p>

<p>Thousands of scientists believe evolution by natural selection didn&#39;t occur. But that&#39;s a different topic... </p>

<p>So why would I bring that up? Well, minority opinion isn&#39;t particularly convincing. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you could list your top... 5? Or even 3? </p>

<p>But before you put the Van Allen belts on that list, please quantify the amount of radiation they would&#39;ve been exposed to and compare it to things like Nuclear Power Plant workers. </p>

<p>Try 60%, which is also the lowest figure recorded since they started asking the question. Seems like the conspiracy is losing supporters. </p>

<p>No, it shows that people are a lot less gullible today than they were 40 years ago. The only propaganda that ever moved the needle was that pile of shit movie from Oliver Stone. </p>
