        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello all,</p>

<p>After a year of nearly continuous growth, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has reached the 300,000 user milestone.</p>

<p>By virtue of amazing original content, attentive coverage of meta reddit censorship, and a willingness to highlight subjects considered too &quot;controversial&quot; for many of the &quot;conventional&quot; subreddits, this community has been able to reach the top 25 of <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> on multiple occasions,  and truly impact the way in which those new to reddit perceive the underlying power structure on the medium. </p>

<p>As moderators of such a wonderful community, we feel that our main obligation is to uphold the free flow of information at all costs. As a result of this philosophy, this subreddit is (unfortunately) subject to a litany of attacks (who could forget a certain user using alt accounts to submit vile anti-semitic content to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, only to then pass around the links on his private IRC channels in order to have them upvoted to &quot;prove&quot; his libelous claims of &quot;the rampant racism&quot; on this subreddit). However, regardless of the underhanded and malicious tactics employed by people of that nature, this subreddit continues to grow and foster an environment dedicated to exposing those very people who work tirelessly in an attempt to see this sub shutdown, collapse due to internal strife, or fade into irrelevance.</p>

<p>That said, this community is stronger than ever before and continues to head in a direction which, at one point, was thought impossible; having an impact on <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>. </p>

<p>As a commemoration of the continued progress of the user base within this subreddit, the mod team has decided to hold a contest centered on highlighting the best content (from all time) on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>The rules for the contest are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Feel free to submit nominations to this thread</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Nominations must be in the form of a link to a submission or comment from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a></strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Nominations should include the title of the original post/a summary of the comment, a link to the comment or submission, and a link to the author&#39;s profile.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>The top 10 finalists (by virtue of total net vote score) will be sorted and placed into an anonymous poll.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>No repeat submissions and one contest submission per user</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>The user who submits the winning entry will be provided a prize, which at this moment will probably be a custom flair of the user&#39;s choosing (no nsfw images, subject to the approval of the css mods).</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>The end date for round one of the voting will be Sunday, April 26th at 8PM EST</strong>. The end date for voting on the final poll will be announced in a subsequent sticky. </p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>We look forward to seeing the submissions that the community is able to find in the archives of the subreddit, and we suggest sorting the submissions on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/top">top all time</a> in order to find the most interesting content. Also, a friendly reminder that the search feature can be used to sort by post flair, which allows for searching the catalog of posts removed by various mod teams around reddit.</p>

<p>Definitely think the investigative piece about the Pedocracy could be revised, expanded and updated. There&#39;s also a guy in the Netherlands doing a lot of impressive investigative work in this area. Are you familiar with it?</p>

<p>Feels like more and more people are becoming aware of this horrific reality. We need to keep beating the drum.</p>

<p>Not only is the post itself incredibly eye opening, but tracing it as the background into how it was that comment that showcases Reddit censorship, being the post that led to the censorship of the entire sub from <a href="/r/bestof">/r/bestof</a> is interesting as well.

    <div class="md"><p>Either a shill or just extremely close minded. The fact that I see you arguing in every vaccine post makes it suspicious. Why do you care so much? I just don&#39;t see a level headed person without an agenda putting so much time and effort arguing with people on the Internet, especially about vaccines. Plus you never provide any real sources and even if you did, you don&#39;t seem to comprehend that the studies you are referring to are the same studies that we are questioning the authenticity of. The pharmaceutical industry is for profit above all else, they can lie in their studies, by buying or blackmailing the scientists involved. The current state of pharmaceuticals is plain evidence that they value profit over people. Millions of people in this country are addicted to drugs that don&#39;t even really help them. They just create vicious cycles of addiction that create profit for the industry. I just don&#39;t see any reason to allow that industry to inject chemicals into my body when I can&#39;t be absolutely sure what chemicals are in the shot. The whole reason this conspiracy exists is that those of us that are observing the world around us have lost trust in the medical system. The signs of their deceit are all around us. We don&#39;t trust them to inject us with stuff. That&#39;s the bottom line, and all the arguing you&#39;re doing isn&#39;t going to convince us differently. You need more detailed information if you really care to change our opinions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have too much free time on my hands and I like to argue? It honestly takes very little time. Anyways I could say the same about all the people on this sub that post ridiculous articles and paragraphs upon paragraphs about vaccines or whatever their pet conspiracy is. Those people definitely spend far more of their time than me. I put sources sometimes when they are needed. And that&#39;s not how science works. You just can&#39;t claim it is wrong. You have to do a study showing it is wrong. There&#39;s a whole world of scientists out there. I assure you they aren&#39;t paying every single one and every industry is for profit so I don&#39;t see your point. The current state? You mean where they regularly pull drugs off the market when they find them to be unsafe? That&#39;s surely not profitable. These aren&#39;t unknown chemicals they are tested and what is in them is released to the public. Do you personally test what is in your orange juice every morning? See the problem is some people just want to go against the grain and act like they are the victim in some grand scheme in order to feel important. Most people won&#39;t change their mind no matter what and just stick to their particular bias even when they don&#39;t hold anything else up to that same standard. Again I ask you do you test your orange juice every time you buy a jug? Full on lab tests with analysis for bacteria and viral particles?</p>

<p>Gardasil is one example of a vaccine that maims and kills: <a href="http://www.hormonesmatter.com/gardasil-autopsies-reveal-cerebral-vasculitis/">http://www.hormonesmatter.com/gardasil-autopsies-reveal-cerebral-vasculitis/</a>  So you can take your fucking &quot;lol&quot; and shove it up your ass because many MANY parents have suffered from this vaccine as their child is horribly maimed or even killed.  IS THAT FUNNY YET?  I AM LAUGHING SO MUCH.  You fucking inhumane tool.</p>

<p>Or how about the polio vaccine that had tumor-inducing side effects that they kept secret? <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/041345_cdc_polio_vaccine_sv40.html">http://www.naturalnews.com/041345_cdc_polio_vaccine_sv40.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has once again been caught removing pertinent but indicting information about vaccines from its website. This time it involves the infamous polio vaccine, up to 98 million doses of which have been exposed as containing a cancer-causing virus that is now believed to be responsible for causing millions of cancers in America, according to the CDC.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why? Why would you trust her over 99% of scientists? If you re talking about following the money look at her! She is trying to sell a damn book. Real scientists don&#39;t sell a book, they write actual papers and at them submitted to journals. And wow you are a danger to your own child. How sad. But surely you know anecdotal evidence counts for nothing right? Your kid is luckily protected by herd immunity. Hopefully your kid won&#39;t play in the woods and get bitten by some animal and then die of rabies because you won&#39;t go out and get him vaccinated. Your own damn link says it isn&#39;t clear if gardasil is actually linked with it and more research is needed. Actually read what you link says before just taking the headlines and running with it. There was an accidental contamination of the polio vaccines. I mean seriously? You don&#39;t think accidents ever happen? Especially back in the 60&#39;s when medical science was much less advanced? And how am I at all being pedantic. Also the CDC doesn&#39;t hide it. It&#39;s on their website. So yeah your little news sites are lying to you for page views. You realize there is a thing called science that tests these vaccines right? Some company doesn&#39;t just give needles to doctors and say yep this totally works. Like do you not use computers? Because the evil companies could have put in radiation emitters to poison you? Oh wait you obviously do use computers. So how about you pick your battles and not try to use an evil company excuse because that only exposes your bias.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t trust 99% of politicians, big banks, big ag, why would I trust big pharma?  Not gonna happen, good luck being a profit stream for board rooms.</p>

<p>Science has been usurped like politics in our day and age.  Money has tainted everything and corruption is rampant in all agencies, corporations and special interest groups.</p>

<p>I do not trust chemical weapon manufacturers to spray my food.  I do not trust politicians who have passed acts like the Patriot Act or any number of horrible legislation (or removal of legislation Glass–Steagall etc) to govern me.  I do not trust big banks who have rigged major things like LIBOR or who subjugate nations through economic means while making billions in profit.  I do not trust pharmaceutical companies who hang on the myth of brain-chemical imbalances which can never be measured, only assumed - then they dose you with brain-altering chemicals that many have died from or become empty husks wishing for suicide.  I do not trust vaccines made by these companies, known to make many mistakes and not tell the public.  MISTAKES HAPPEN?  Ya, tell that to the tens of thousands of people with cancer who are suffering because of that one mess up. </p>

<p>Or how about recently when Bill Gate&#39;s polio vaccine caused 47,500 new cases of paralysis: <a href="http://www.issuesinmedicalethics.org/202co114.html">http://www.issuesinmedicalethics.org/202co114.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, while India has been polio-free for a year, there has been a huge increase in non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (NPAFP). In 2011, there were an extra 47,500 new cases of NPAFP. Clinically indistinguishable from polio paralysis but twice as deadly, the incidence of NPAFP was directly proportional to doses of oral polio received. Though this data was collected within the polio surveillance system, it was not investigated. The principle of primum-non-nocere was violated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or how about</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the Tuskegee experiment, the U.S. Public Health Service was studying the progression of syphilis in black men in rural Alabama, and researchers were faulted for failing to treat the men even after penicillin was discovered as a treatment for the disease.</p>

<p>In Guatemala, however, researchers deliberately infected subjects with syphilis, gonorrhea, and chancroid from 1946 to 1948. In some cases, when male subjects did not become infected with syphilis after having sex with prostitutes who had the disease, researchers exposed the bacteria to wounds on their faces or penises. Participants in the study included psychological patients and prison inmates. Orphans and children who attended state-run schools also were included but not intentionally exposed to the diseases.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Makers of Gardasil awarding 6Billion to families affected by vaccine, won by real science;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Judicial Watch announced today that it has received documents from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) revealing that its National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) has awarded $5,877,710 dollars to 49 victims in claims made against the highly controversial HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccines. To date 200 claims have been filed with VICP, with barely half adjudicated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And you trust these fuckin people?  That&#39;s the government, researchers from a University, and corporate pharmaceutical companies all partaking in various scandals on different levels.  Imagine the shit we&#39;ll find out in 40 years about what&#39;s going on now.</p>

<p>Do you even consider the fact that when a vaccine is rolled around, they change the diagnosis of that disease to alter statistics or they clump the disease with some thing else.  It&#39;s been proven that the new diagnosis skew the numbers in their favor.</p>

<p>For example how they categorize the flu:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 2001, a year in which death certificates listed 257 Americans as having died of flu, only <strong>18</strong> were positively identified as true flus. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>A far cry for the number they use to scare everyone into gettin the shot: The typical estimate is 36,000 [deaths] a year in the United States,&quot; reports NBC, citing the Centers for Disease Control.</p>

Assuming everyone is trying to poison you is just delusional and paranoid. And yeah you can bring up the shit that happened in the 40&#39;s but that&#39;s not a relevant point at all and you can even lie about bill gates but that just shows your ignorance. The real issue is that vaccines save lives and move society forward as they remove diseases and allow us to live a more worry free life. Letting ignorance and fear get in the way of that is shameful.</p>

<p>Especially the David Chandler shout out. Wish that master (David himself) would get in an AMA. I suppose it might be too toxic, with the debunkers around... I wouldn&#39;t blame him.</p>

<p>Who knows, optimism is not a bad thing. We should all be more optimistic for the truth movement.</p>

<p>It will keep growing and the media (reddit) will keep trying to make us look like fools.</p>

<p><em>jah bless</em> all of you</p>

<p>It would be a dream!</p>

<p>Edit mods i don&#39;t want to be banned again, for any amount of time, so please give me fair warning if you deem this an attack. Thank you for your generous considerations. Thank you for letting 911 truth prosper!</p>

<p>No, he didn&#39;t. Read the original post again.
