<p>There&#39;s plenty of evidence of a plane hitting the pentagon. Have you even bothered to look?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Even if you exclude the remains of the people found inside the Pentagon - still strapped to aircraft seats - whose DNA matched the individuals who were listed on flight 77... </p></li>
<li><p>And the large chunks of airplane parts that were scattered around the point of the impact...</p></li>
<li><p>And the engine parts found inside the Pentagon that matched a 757... </p></li>
<li><p>And the multiple light poles that could not have been knocked down by a cruise missile...</p></li>
<li><p>And the air traffic controllers that testified that there were no military aircraft in the vicinity...</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You <strong>STILL</strong> have the sworn testimony of 103 people who - with their own eyes - watched the plane fly into the building.</p>

<p>The only people who say this are ignorant &quot;truthers&quot; that either keep forgetting this factoid has already been refuted. Or conveniently forget about its refutation because the REAL truth doesn&#39;t match their personal, fervently-dogmatic ideology. </p>

<p>OK.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the report from an eyewitness inside the Pentagon that saw <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/sept01/2001-09-14-pentagon-usat.htm">bodies still strapped to their seats.</a></p>

<p>Here is the article from CBS News that mentions that <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/remains-of-9-sept-11-hijackers-held/">DNA testing helped to identify the bodies:</a></p>

<p><em>&quot;...all but five of the 184 victims at the Pentagon site were identified months ago... Families of the airplanes&#39; passengers and crews and those who died within the Pentagon provided DNA samples, typically on toothbrushes or hairbrushes, to aid with identification.&quot;</em></p>

<p>And <a href="http://www.cstl.nist.gov/div831/strbase/pub_pres/Edson2004.pdf">here&#39;s an excerpt from a published, peer-reviewed paper talking about the DNA identification process:</a></p>

<p><em>&quot;Nuclear DNA testing (along with dental records and fingerprints) of the remains from the victims aboard American Airline (AA) Flight 77 and within the Pentagon was useful for identifying 178 of the 183 victims. Five missing individuals (four within the Pentagon and one aboard the airplane) could not be identified due to lack of biological material from the crash. Five remaining nuclear STR profiles were obtained from the crash site that did not match any references for the victims. These profiles were thought to represent the terrorists aboard the flight.</em></p>

<p>People believe many crimes occurred without the criminals confessing. And it isn&#39;t uncommon for things to be revealed when events get declassified well after they occurred. Let me ask if you had to say more or less than 50% likely by 2025, which would you say? What about 2030? </p>

<p>Interesting. So the fact that some countries, such as most of Europe, doesn&#39;t put fluoride in water, means what exactly? For that matter, what does eating organic or having fluoride in water have to do with this? </p>

<p>So you think that fluoride has something to do with this, how? What do you think fluoride is doing that would make people believe this?</p>

<p>Note by the way that the differences aren&#39;t that large. Aside from Turkey, European countries depending on the country have anywhere from 7-25% apparently thinking the US government had something to do with 9/11. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polls_about_9/11_conspiracy_theories#Europe">summary here</a>. That&#39;s about what the range is in the US too by only a small fraction above. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>No single chemical has an effect of making people more gullible, or making them more stupid but only in a very subtle way that apparently doesn&#39;t impact their ability to do top-notch science. So I fail to see the connection.</p>

<p>It is important that <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/i3/making_beliefs_pay_rent_in_anticipated_experiences/">beliefs pay rent in terms of giving one information about what one should expect to see happen in the future</a>. For example, the ancient Greeks disagreed about what the world was made out of. For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraclitus">Heraclitus</a> thought that everything was fundamentally fire. Others thought that the classical elements as we know them were what made everything (earth, air, fire, water and aether). But the important thing wasn&#39;t to ask &quot;what is this made out of&quot; but rather &quot;what does my belief about what this is made out of tell to expect?&quot; If one person claims that everything is water, and another claims everything is fire, if there&#39;s no useful prediction that distinguishes them, then there&#39;s nothing useful being said. Beliefs should make us anticipate things that will occur. So with that in mind, is there something you would expect to happen or be likely to happen in the future that someone who buys the conventional 9/11 story would consider to be unlikely? </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://whatreallyhappened.com/WRHARTICLES/911_pentagon_renovations.html">&quot;...an area of the Pentagon that was under construction at the time&quot; refuted.</a></p>

<p>The construction to that particular area had been completed prior to 9/11.</p>

<p><a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/mirrors/guardian2/pentagon/what-hit-it.htm">&quot;a hole SMALLER than the size of the plane&quot; refuted.</a></p>

<p>It turns out that the damage to the building is consistent with the damage from a commercial jet aircraft.</p>

<p>This concurs with the testimony of 103 eyewitnesses who said they saw the plane hit the Pentagon.</p>

<p>And the 26 people who stated that it was an American Airlines jet.</p>

<p>And the 7 people who stated it was a Boeing 757.</p>
