        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/32pmo2/searching_for_the_truth_about_vaccines_a/">Here</a> is the post I submitted to <a href="/r/medicine">/r/medicine</a>, after a political issue in my home state was advocated for by a medical professional on the subreddit. I made a similar post <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/32p9bz/searching_for_the_truth_about_vaccines/">here</a>, where you can read the 10 research points I presented. However, I had included a paragraph to specifically address this research to the medical professionals of &quot;meddit&quot;, seeking their professional opinion, based on the fact that their subreddit was promoting a bill in my home state that would make vaccinations mandatory for school-children.</p>

<p>I tagged myself as a layperson and sourced every one of my claims. I was specifically hoping to receive a response from medical professionals, instead of just normal reddit users.</p>

<p>The post was removed without notice. My first message to the mods received a response from <a href="/u/pintastico">/u/pintastico</a> <a href="https://imgur.com/a/xBzXm">&quot;Because you are nuts&quot;</a>.</p>

<p>The official response of the mod team, from <a href="/u/emergdoc">/u/emergdoc</a>, was that the post was a personal agenda. They based this on my posts in the past few days centering on vaccines. Meanwhile I have an account that is 5 years old and have spoken my mind truthfully on many matters, please review my history of more than just the past week if you would like confirmation. My <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/8x5sp/if_anyone_on_reddit_is_a_veterinarian_do_you_know/c0appp1">first comment</a> was in <a href="/r/AskReddit">/r/AskReddit</a> 5 years ago, about a growth on a dog&#39;s paw.</p>

<p><a href="/u/emergdoc">/u/emergdoc</a>, as an official mod of <a href="/r/medicine">/r/medicine</a>, also <a href="https://imgur.com/a/xBzXm">suggested that I had mental health problems</a> in response to my research compilation.</p>

<p>Whatever your views on vaccination are right now, this is a definitive abuse of mod powers in what is presented to reddit as a professional subreddit. This is a trend across many subreddits right now, and this censorship of discussion goes complete against the spirit of this site. Mods were originally allowed to prevent spam and have instead become gatekeepers of political opinions. This is the opposite of science and yet is constantly masked under the name of science.</p>

<p>EDIT: Asking about why my post has deleted has elicited <a href="https://imgur.com/a/CKEbL">more insults from the moderators of /r/medicine, as well as a permanent ban from posting there</a>.</p>

<p>EDIT 2: If you&#39;re keeping track, so far two pro-vax users have deleted their accounts while arguing with me, <a href="/u/PlaceboReponse">/u/PlaceboReponse</a> and <a href="/u/AntiVaccination">/u/AntiVaccination</a>.</p>

<p>EDIT 3: Just got a message from a deleted author about those deleted accounts: &quot;The account wasn&#39;t deleted because you won, rather because you&#39;ve been relegated it <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and no legit sub will post any of your garbage. Most other anti-vaxers have been relegated to that cesspool. You&#39;re in good company there.&quot; Amazing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do you people continue to not understand that mods own their subs. They can do whatever they want, no matter what you like. </p>

<p>Posting every single time someone deletes posts from their own sub does literally nothing.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t even do anything within this sub. Most of you already forgot that a week ago the mods here all collectively spit in your face for the half dozenth time by once again reinstating a mod who a) said he&#39;ll never step down no matter what anyone here says, cause your aren&#39;t important. And b) he also called you all children...ignoring that he banned a number of people just cause they disagreed.</p>

<p>The sooner you realize you are entitled to absolutely nothing from the mods who can do ANYTHING they want, and there is NOTHING you can do about it. Then the sooner you&#39;ll stop getting worked up about hypocrisy and whatever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The general population is pro-vaccine for a combination of reasons.</p>

<p>First off, a lot of them really do work. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be downvoted for writing that here in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> because that doesn&#39;t match our preconceived notions and we won&#39;t do or won&#39;t believe the research / science. But it&#39;s the truth, and the people know it&#39;s the truth. There are diseases that have been all but eradicated among vaccinated populations in timeframes that correspond exactly with the availability of the vaccinations, and people do know that. Anyway, bring on the downvotes.</p>

<p>Second, they are confronted with the anti-vac movement which tells them that <strong>none of them work</strong> and <strong>all of them are dangerous</strong> and have used idiotic spokespeople like Jenny McCarthy to do it. This isn&#39;t the truth and it&#39;s pretty plainly clear that it isn&#39;t the truth, so they discount everything else negative anyone says about any vaccine, period.</p>

<p>So now you have a situation where there really are some potentially harmful vaccines and some vaccines that really don&#39;t do much of anything aside from adding to the bottom lines of big pharma... but everyone&#39;s just blanket using them anyway because of the combination of bullshit they see from both sides of the issue.</p>

<p>What is needed to shine the light on the truth is an organization that will act in a reputable, responsible manner. By that, I mean an organization that will actually compile the science, do their own testing when necessary, and say whatever the science tells them is accurate, without catering to any agenda whatsoever. Such an organization would necessarily say, &quot;These vaccines are just fine, and here&#39;s the evidence that shows they&#39;re safe and effective,&quot; for some vaccines, because it&#39;s the truth for some vaccines.  It would also say, &quot;These vaccines have harmful ingredients in harmful doses and here&#39;s the evidence to back that up,&quot; and &quot;These vaccines, while not apparently harmful, seem to be about as effective as not vaccinating and here&#39;s the evidence to back that up.&quot;</p>

<p>Until an organization chooses to tell the complete, accurate story on vaccines, you&#39;re going to see the vast majority continuing on as they are now, either not vaccinating with anything and putting themselves or their loved ones at undue risk by avoiding the good ones or vaccinating with everything and putting themselves or their loved ones at undue risk by taking the bad ones.</p>

<p>If such an organization were to exist and do that, it would also put immense pressure on Big Pharma and government oversight agencies like the FDA and CDC to clean up their act, and to deliver only those vaccines that they have really tested and proved to be both safe and effective.</p>

<p>To this day, there has still not been any double blind testing on the long term impacts of any vaccination (that I am aware of), which makes it one of the few medical treatments done on any sort of scale being performed with abolutely guarentees of effectiveness or safety.</p>

<p>Double blind tests are the gold standard of medical operations, and yet they are not applied to vaccines.</p>

<p>Make of that what you will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The lack of due process is criminal... But again, it is not in anyone&#39;s interest to do them.</p>

<p>The duration of long term studies is measured in years, which means it will have no affect on the current debate.</p>

<p>Pharma won&#39;t do it as it could potentially reduce the earnings from what they sell.</p>

<p>Government bodies could throw resources at it... But these resources could be better spent elsewhere.</p>

<p>It is currently political AND academic suicide if you make a finding contrary to the line being pushed right now.</p>

<p>I can think of no other groups that can do these necessary studies.</p>

<p>Yes, and this post has direct evidence of personal attacks on me by the medical professional mods of <a href="/r/medicine">/r/medicine</a>. After those personal attacks (there were more than what I posted), they banned me from the subreddit.</p>

<p>It is personal, the subreddit had on its frontpage a doctor promoting a bill to make vaccinations mandatory <strong>in my home state where I live</strong>. That is a personal and political agenda for that doctor, and that post was allowed, because it fits the political agenda of the moderators of <a href="/r/medicine">/r/medicine</a>.</p>

<p>It&#39;s plain as day hypocrisy to anyone who&#39;s looking at it unbiased. Do you have any comment on the way the mods of <a href="/r/medicine">/r/medicine</a> conducted themselves?</p>

<p>Yes please, let&#39;s discuss that article.</p>

<p>The first two paragraphs contain zero scientific data. The third paragraph is a strawman to debunk, this is a common dishonest debate tactic. The fourth paragraph is another strawman. The fifth paragraph is an incorrect stating of the anti-vax position, which gives the author another strawman to tear down.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not until the tenth paragraph, after reading emotionally laden descriptions of his strawman opposition, that the author actually presents his own argument.</p>

<p>And then his entire argument is to say &quot;oh, wait, don&#39;t look at <strong>mortality rates</strong>, look at <strong>incidence rates</strong>&quot;.</p>

<p>No one is making an argument about incidence rates.</p>

<p>The official data show dramatic decreases in <strong>mortality rates</strong> in both the <a href="http://healthsentinel.com/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=2654:united-states-disease-death-rates&amp;amp;catid=55:united-states-deaths-from-diseases&amp;amp;Itemid=55">United States</a> and in <a href="http://healthsentinel.com/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=2653:england-and-wales-death-rates&amp;amp;catid=54:england-and-wales-death-rates&amp;amp;Itemid=55">England and Wales</a>.</p>

<p>If these communicable diseases provably <em>stopped killing people before the introduction of vaccines</em>, why do we need to sacrifice our right to informed consent and body autonomy for these vaccines?</p>

<p>Right now the US government is in an ongoing trial against Merck, the manufacturer of the MMR vaccine, alleging it attempted to <a href="http://healthimpactnews.com/2014/judge-lawsuit-against-mercks-mmr-vaccine-fraud-to-continue/">&quot;defraud the United States through an onging scheme to sell the government a mumps vaccine that is mislabeled, misbranded, adulterated, and falsely certified as having an efficacy rate that is significantly higher than it actually is&quot;</a>. <strong>Why shouldn&#39;t I be able to refuse to take that vaccine?</strong></p>

<p>It leaves me very worried to know that <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-106hhrg73042/html/CHRG-106hhrg73042.htm">members of the CDC and FDA responsible for licensing and recommending vaccines are permitted to have financial stakes in those vaccines</a>, and that everyone I bring this up to anywhere dismisses it as if it doesn&#39;t matter.</p>

<p>Conflicts of interest, of any level much less this enormous scale, call into question all of the current conclusions and recommendations that are being presented by those agencies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. Read your 10 facts. They&#39;re not really even arguments. The only compelling argument is the lack of a double blind test. The fact is, vaccines have been shown to help prevent and cure diseases, and furthermore, do you have any facts that say vaccines are bad at all? They seem to be pretty much harmless.the Vaccine related deaths have to do with poor adminstration, or missing an allergy or some other human error. Some of then may even die from the disease. </p>

<p>To this day, there has still not been any double blind testing on the long term impacts of any vaccination (that I am aware of), which makes it one of the few medical treatments done on any sort of scale being performed with abolutely guarentees of effectiveness or safety.</p>

<p>Double blind tests are the gold standard of medical operations, and yet they are not applied to vaccines.</p>
