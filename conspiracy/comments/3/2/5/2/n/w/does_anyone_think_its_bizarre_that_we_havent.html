<p>Actually, this <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/09/15/most-boston-residents-favor-life-without-parole-for-tsarnaev-convicted-poll-shows/Ur6ivWIUiYCpEZLXBApHDL/story.html">isn&#39;t true</a>. Only 33% want the death penalty. However, the jury likely does not reflect these stats, because in order to be selected they had to say they could potentially apply the death penalty in this case. So the jury is likely much more pro-death penalty than your average Bostonian.</p>

<p>Did you just assume most Bostonians would want him to get death?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of all the other reasons I oppose the death penalty (state-sanctioned murder, history of innocent people sentenced, etc) this one has always aggravated me. Say you&#39;re charged with a capital crime. At least in theory, you are to be tried by a jury of your peers, which I would take to mean a relatively unbiased sample (unbiased in how they are selected, that is, not necessarily the individual jurors). </p>

<p>But by automatically removing anyone opposed to the death penalty, you skew the sample to a population more predisposed to the concept of retributive justice. To my mind, this makes it more likely that you will be convicted of the crime itself, let alone the sentencing phase.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have apparently been totally misinformed. The defense had no choice in the matter - because this was a federal case and the feds are trying for the death penalty, being totally against the death penalty disqualified you from serving on the jury. Just as people who might say &quot;I&#39;ll definitely vote for the death penalty!&quot; were disqualified for being prejudicial, so too were people who said &quot;I could never vote for the death penalty.&quot; Both of these groups had their mind made up before the trial, which means they couldn&#39;t see the evidence and decide based on that whether Tsarnaev deserved death.</p>

<p>This feature of the jury has been <a href="http://www.pri.org/stories/2015-01-05/massachusetts-isnt-ok-death-penalty-dzhokhar-tsarnaevs-jurors-have-be">widely reported</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Journalist Masha Gessen, who covered the trial at the federal courthouse in Boston, says the juror selection process offered a clash between Massachusetts culture and federal law. Capital punishment hasn&#39;t been legal in Massachusetts since 1982 and hasn&#39;t been used in a state case since 1947. &quot;The vast majority of residents are opposed to the death penalty,&quot; Gessen says. &quot;On the other hand, it&#39;s a federal case, it&#39;s a death penalty case.&#39;&#39;</p>

<p>What that meant: <strong>Any juror who was opposed to the death penalty was automatically disqualified.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please, at least read up minimally on the case before thinking you know everything about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, but there&#39;s the rub - you didn&#39;t <em>know</em> anything. This situation (needing jury members to consider the death penalty) holds true for every capital case, ever. You seem to be suffering from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect">Dunning-Kruger effect</a> - you were so ignorant about these issues that you were incapable of recognizing your own ignorance. If you didn&#39;t know that capital cases require jurors to be theoretically pro-death penalty, you know very little about the law indeed. As I said, productive discussions usually require the participants to have at least some background knowledge of the matter at hand, but again I understand that you were incapable of understanding your own ignorance. By educating yourself, you may gain a better perspective on your intellectual shortcomings. Hopefully, this conversation can be a first step in that journey. Good luck!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You would have to look at the methods of the survey, but the authors say there is a 3.7% margin of error:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The random telephone poll was conducted by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center for the Globe and included responses from 704 adults in Boston. The survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In my experience, regulars at Boston bars trend older, whiter, and more male than the population at large - meaning they are likely more conservative and more supportive of the death penalty than the average resident.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, but this is the whole premise of random sampling. They design the survey so that the sampling is truly random, and an accurate picture of the city as a whole can be determined.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll just note that earlier you were apparently convinced by what you heard in Boston bars, but now a study that is much larger than your anecdotal one isn&#39;t comprehensive enough.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course it is terrible quality.  They have to escort the guy in and out of prison thru a back door where no cameras are just in case somebody tries to kill him on their own because they are afraid he won&#39;t get the death penalty  so this picture was taken from a helicopter.  But it doesn&#39;t matter.  It could be a close up of the guy&#39;s face and people who think this was all just a staged event would still say it wasn&#39;t him or &quot;well it&#39;s him but he is just taking the fall&quot; or whatever.  There is no evidence that is going to change anybody&#39;s mind.  There was a video released where he puts a backpack down and then moments later a bomb explodes right where he was standing and people still ignored that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do you figure that seeing someone in court is more likely to create a martyr than shit like <a href="http://i.imgur.com/0U0ozqt.jpg">this?</a></p>

<p>Do you honestly believe that the brother who at least got a trial is more likely to be a martyr than the one who was murdered viciously under suspicious circumstances and likely while in police custody?  </p>

<p>This whole &#39;don&#39;t want them to be martyrs&#39; idea is a fairytale and nothing more.  They&#39;re more than happy to plaster murdered leaders and dead terrorists all over the news, as long as they actually have photos or any proof of the person&#39;s death.  They only reel this martyr excuse out for shit they can&#39;t prove like Osama bin Laden&#39;s death or a fake trial that wouldn&#39;t pass as legitimate in the public eye.  </p>

<p>Your suspicion should be raised every time they claim that proof must be withheld from the public for fear of creating martyrs.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the backpacks was annihilated, supposedly Dzhokhar&#39;s. Tamerlan&#39;s was allegedly still intact (per the FBI photos) after the bombings. Pieces of what appears to be a backpack can be seen around blast sight #2, however these pieces are not white at all.</p>

<p>As for why the second backpack was destroyed and the other wasn&#39;t, had to do with the positioning of the pressure cookers inside the packs. Blast backpack #1 was supposedly positioned right side up, which allowed the bottom of the bag (or, rather, whichever side was placed on the ground) to remain intact as the blast pushed it to the floor. The other pack&#39;s cooker was allegedly positioned sideways, directed at the youngest dead victim of the bombings. This directed the bottom and tops of the cookers at the both sides of the backpack that were not pointed at the ground, allowing the backpack to explode and achieve maximum damage to the pack itself.</p>

<p>This is what &quot;they&quot; say.</p>

<p>Not exactly a smoking gun but it adds another layer of intrigue to the story. Also kind of makes you think about his throat wound. People were wondering how that happened.</p>

<p>I think if you search you can find a comment from one of his old schoolmates who said it didn&#39;t seem like him at all, especially with the accent.</p>

<p>*Maybe I needed it for my boat</p>

<p>*Maybe I stole it for my dad</p>
