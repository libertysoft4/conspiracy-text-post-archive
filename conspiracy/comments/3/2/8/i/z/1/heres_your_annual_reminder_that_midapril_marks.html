        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/22uvwi/in_some_occult_traditions_a_period_of_sacrifice/">I posted this reminder last year</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1ca0uf/the_dates_april_19th_to_may_1st_are_said_to_have/">2 years ago I posted the same warning</a> and 2 days later the Boston Bombing happened. Sacrifice by &quot;fire.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/si1x2/the_elites_ritual_days_of_april_19th_and_april/">3 years ago</a> I mentioned the importance of the days of April 19/20 in particular.</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/h3hzx/a_triple_ritual_just_took_place_on_the_occult/">And 4 years ago</a> I made a similar observation in <a href="/r/occult">/r/occult</a> about the timing of Bin Laden&#39;s &quot;death&quot; and the ritual day of May 1st.</p>

<p>So for the 5th year in a row, I just wanted to remind folks to be wary of this time of year, and be skeptical of any &quot;fiery&quot; events that may occur, especially within the next week or so.</p>

<p>The more aware and awake we are, the less likely they&#39;ll be able to get away with their bullshit.</p>

<p>Much love!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So leaving aside that that hit April 25, I&#39;m curious: are you arguing that this large scale conspiracy engaging in false flags attacks is a) both able to do so outside the US and b) able to fake a large-scale earthquake? How exactly do you do the second?</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that you didn&#39;t actually answer the question until a a month after I asked the question. Too bad. That strongly suggests that you weren&#39;t nearly as confident about this as you&#39;d like to act like you are.  </p>

<p>The period of sacrifice is traditionally April 19-May 1, see my posts from previous years.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Nothing is &quot;faked.&quot; The theory (which I&#39;m <em>investigating</em>...I don&#39;t <em>believe</em> it) is that certain off-the-books technologies are able to target weaknesses in fault lines and trigger a &quot;traditional&quot; earthquake.</p>

<p>The energy required is fractions of the energy released by the quake. Using mother nature in this way provides the perfect means to plausibly deny involvement.</p>

<p>Much research has been done into how the major earthquakes of the last 20-30 years have been possibly artificially induced. A simple internet search will yield countless results.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not confident about this at all. This is off-the-wall speculation and nothing more.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been only a couple of weeks since the earthquake, and I&#39;ve read a few articles and watched a few videos that suggest this was a strategic move, for whatever reason.</p>

<p>Some believe that WWIII has been happening, right under our noses, for quite some time.</p>

<p>Some people also believe that the Earth is flat, and some believe that Jews did 9/11, etc. etc. The sheer act of someone believing something is not useful evidence of anything whatsoever.
