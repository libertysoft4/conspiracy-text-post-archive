<li>He makes a lot of money.</li>
<li>He has been predicting the collapse of the US and the rise of martial law and concentration camps being 6 months away since 2010. </li>
<li>He is the only person in history to have ever properly re-acted to Piers Morgan. </li>
<li>He is partly responsible for Icke becoming more political and less about &#39;reptiles&#39; (He wouldn&#39;t let Icke talk about reptiles on air) </li>
<li>He points out real shit that is actually being reported that is fucking insane. </li>
<li>He sells snake oil. </li>
<li>He never addresses predictions he has made that do not come to pass</li>
<li>Trumptes all the times he was right, ignores all of the times he was wrong. </li>
</ul>

<p>In short. I think <em>he is</em> awakened and <strong>decided to capitalize</strong> on what was going on. He uses a lot of fear and some pretty over the top theatrics to get his point across and sometimes that point is a BS prediction that turns out wrong. As far as him being a shill or controlled op, idk.Can&#39;t be proven. Some of what he says is true some isn&#39;t. </p>

<p>I think he is an honest to goodness red blooded american who was slowly waking up. He started his public radio/tv show the same way and for the same reason anyone does. I personally believe that whatever you think of him he had a few turning points in his career. One was when he infiltrated bohemian grove and one was when he predicted 9/11. </p>

<p>I think that both of these events plus the success of infowars as a business catapulted him into the stratosphere mentally. He no longer doubts himself or anything he thinks. Whether or not he is on cocaine or not is irrelevant. He behaves as if he is coked out of his mind. Not just because of the over the top paranoia and screaming sessions but because of the absolutist approach he has to every passing thought in his brain. He thinks every thought he has is brilliant all of the time and often narrates himself and his genius ideas on air. </p>

<p>I stay away from him now because everything he had to offer (the deconstruction of the MSM bullshit) is something you can do on your own. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like Alex. </p>

<p>However, I critically analyze every source I come across. Just like with everyone else, I look up events, documents, and books AJ cites and then come to my own conclusions. I&#39;ve learned a lot using this strategy. For example, when I first heard Alex talk about Operation Gladio I assumed he was exaggerating. I checked out Daniel Ganser&#39;s book about the topic, realized it was all true, and now I&#39;m the one explaining to people how the West organizes false flag terror.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to buy into his more bombastic segments or fear mongering, just objectively analyze the information he conveys as you would any other source. Also, the idea that selling products makes him a fake is absurd imo. That&#39;s what you&#39;re supposed to do in a free country. In fact, if he wasn&#39;t trying to grow and expand his business (thus getting the word out to more people), I&#39;d be suspicious.</p>

<p>Alex <strong>Jew</strong>nz will agree that his &quot;Globalists&quot; own and control U.S. Corporate Media but the minute you attempt to pinpoint exactly who his &quot;Globalists&quot; are by name then <strong>Jew</strong>nz instantly pumps the brakes on the conversation.... and censors it.</p>

<p><strong>Comcast Corporation</strong>, formerly registered as Comcast Holdings,[note 1] is an American mass media company and is the largest broadcasting and cable company in the world by revenue.[2] It is the largest cable company and home Internet service provider in the United States,[8] and the nation&#39;s third largest home telephone service provider  </p>

<p>Comcast is sometimes described as a family business.[23] <strong>Brian L. Roberts, Chairman, President, and CEO of Comcast, is son of co-founder Ralph Roberts</strong>. Brian owns or controls just over 1% of all Comcast shares but all of the Class B supervoting shares, which gives him an &quot;undilutable 33% voting power over the company&quot;.[24] Legal expert Susan P. Crawford has said this gives him &quot;effective control over its [Comcast&#39;s] every step&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s a human being. Much of what is said about him is an attempt at character assassination. It&#39;s obvious that there is a person, or persons, on this sub who is determined to trash Alex Jones&#39;s charcter and destroy his reputation. Most of what they come up with against Jones is exaggeration and lies.</p>

<p>That being said, I&#39;m not a fan of Jones and don&#39;t listen to his show regularly these days. He has character faults that offend me and his reports are unreliable. Sometimes he presents useful, accurate information, and sometimes he spouts fear-mongering garbage.</p>
