        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So Jade Helm 15 is a simulation going down for a national security strategy.</p>

<p>It was brought up on another forum that they may be using local Walmarts in states where the simulation is taking place as 5+ announced they were closing for 6+ months for &quot;plumbing issues&quot;</p>

<p>IIRc Walmart does have an agreement with DHS which states that DHS can use Walmart stores as training facilities.</p>

<p>It seems even more odd that the employees at the closed Walmarts were given 10 hours notice or less, some stores only gave workers a 5 hour notice</p>

<p>Links for Walmart closings</p>

<p>A PDF about Jade Helm 15, looks like a summary (didn&#39;t make it but it has things I didn&#39;t know but I can&#39;t say accurate it is)</p>

<p>Some more general information of the simulation</p>

<p><a href="http://www.truthandaction.org/operation-jade-helm-massive-military-drill-across-7-states-unconventional-warfare/">http://www.truthandaction.org/operation-jade-helm-massive-military-drill-across-7-states-unconventional-warfare/</a></p>

<p>The normal, &quot;nothing to see here article&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2015/03/31/why-the-new-special-operations-exercise-freaking-out-the-internet-is-no-big-deal/">http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2015/03/31/why-the-new-special-operations-exercise-freaking-out-the-internet-is-no-big-deal/</a></p>

<p>Another main stream source, at least this one goes into a little more detail about how the military participants are supposed to be remain undetected by Civilians. Talks about how it could be a martial law simulation event.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3013900/Fears-martial-law-special-ops-set-swarm-Southwest-operate-undetected-civilians-ve-deemed-HOSTILE-massive-military-exercise.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3013900/Fears-martial-law-special-ops-set-swarm-Southwest-operate-undetected-civilians-ve-deemed-HOSTILE-massive-military-exercise.html</a></p>

<p>This is a very good write up of the whole thing with calls for everyone to express skepticism at the end because it&#39;s needed</p>

<p><a href="http://www.westernjournalism.com/operation-jade-helm-should-we-be-worried/">http://www.westernjournalism.com/operation-jade-helm-should-we-be-worried/</a></p>

<p>This one goes into a little more detail on what participants in the simulation will do. Also touches on the patch for this simulation and the tag line on it &quot;Mastering the Human Domain&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.truthandaction.org/operation-jade-helm-massive-military-drill-across-7-states-unconventional-warfare/2/">http://www.truthandaction.org/operation-jade-helm-massive-military-drill-across-7-states-unconventional-warfare/2/</a></p>

<p>Didn&#39;t see this being discuss here so I thought I would point out that it was happening with weird stuff going on around all sides of it, which means it could very well be more than what was reported from &quot;official sources&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thought about this. For one I&#39;m in Texas, we have our own Military branches which operates under our Governor (God save us). So hoping our Gov doesn&#39;t allow Military advances.</p>

<p>We have 195k people in our Military Branch, since 2013 1.4 million in active duty in the U.S. Military. There are 26 Million people in Texas. (Don&#39;t have numbers for licensed weapons or NRA members)</p>

<p>So for every one member of the Texan Military there are 133 civilians.</p>

<p>Also, sadly to say, military games also contribute a factor to understanding to take orders from a commanding member.</p>

<p>So out of those ideas. I don&#39;t know how they&#39;d do it. If they couldn&#39;t control Iraq, how are they going to control little under a quarter of the U.S.?</p>

<p>I know it seems far fetched by my mind likes to toy with the idea that they have slowly been trying to gain hold in people subconscious by slowly increasing the frequency that these types of lights are seen so the public becomes numb to over militarization and abundance of redundant police/military.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are already patrols going on at night in East Texas.  Jade Helm has already started.  Look all around the world at all the training exercises, Russians now doing exercises with Pakistanians. Russians had 80,000 troops, 220 aircraft, 41 ships, and 15 submarines in the arctic for a 5 day training exercise.  I think we sent 100k troops to Iraq to give you an idea of the size i may be wrong though.  Point is the world is tensing up and so are the observant.  Remember there is a lot of information out there, lets all stay informed.  Cheers</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do have some good questions</p>

<p>I can&#39;t say why the closed 3 months early, if you&#39;re asking my opinion I&#39;d say they were preparing the sites for use. </p>

<p>Another theory is that they could have bought all the merchandise in these stores for use in the simulation since part of the simulation calls for those participating to blend in with the local civilian population. Thus it would take the company  6+ months to rebuild stock. </p>

<p>Those are the 2 most plausible theories that I&#39;ve heard</p>

<p>In regard to the articles about the Walmart closings, at least that I posted had </p>

<p>2 from Texas
1 from Florida
1 from Oklahoma</p>

<p>The below states have all been reported as taking in part in the simulation by multiple sources</p>

<p>Florida, Mississippi, New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, Utah, Colorado, Arizona, Nevada and California ( I&#39;ve seen Georgia a report as well but only by 1 source for the GA)</p>

<p>In what states, that are not listed, have local Walmart been shut down for this same reasoning (6+ months to fix plumbing issues in their one floor building)</p>

<p>Just curious as the only ones I&#39;ve seen has been from one of the states that has been reported to be involved with the Jade Helm exercise.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>A store the size of the typical Wal-Mart can be gutted in a week.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>they could have bought all the merchandise in these stores for use in the simulation</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That seems a bit of a stretch.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thus it would take the company 6+ months to rebuild stock.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve watched 3 Wal-Marts be built near me in the last few years. It doesn&#39;t take 6 months from breaking ground in a field to opening the store.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In what states, that are not listed, have local Walmart been shut down for this same reasoning</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The states in which WalMart stores are closing for &quot;plumbing&quot; that are not participating in Jade Helm are Oklahoma and Florida. 40% of the stores closing are in states that are not Jade Helm states.</p>

<p>You suggest Florida is a Jade Helm state. Do you have a (reputable) source for that? I haven&#39;t found one.</p>

<p>I think the WalMart closings are unrelated to Jade Helm, but rather exactly why they say (most likely) or because employees in the stores have been chattering about unionizing (only slightly less likely than plumbing).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I posted multiple links in the OP that reference Florida as a Jade Helm state.</p>

<p>The government buying all the stock would an abnormal circumstance and would cause suspicion. If that is what happened buy saying &quot;plumbing issues&quot; and closing some stores with less than 5 hour notice to workers is a win for Walmart. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a win for Walmart because the gov buys all their stock, pays them to use the store for the simulation and Walmart doesn&#39;t have to pay wages for these stores over the next 6+ months. This would then allow the Gov to stock their FEMA camps with goods from the closed Walmart stores. Everything from clothes to food.</p>

<p>Opening a store is different than the Government buying all their stock for a training exercise. A Walmart not having anything in it and still open to the public is weird and it would take months to fully restock the store without making the locals suspicious. To compare these two vastly different situations is disingenuous, close to a straw man counter point really. I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re wrong by any means but that the logic presented dismissing the possibility doesn&#39;t seem very sounds.</p>

<p>Florida and additional states were added as notated by the links below (I dislike infowars but still included it as a 3rd source, all are from late March)</p>

<p>I will say that considering Walmarts stance on Unions and some of things they&#39;ve pulled in the past when employees brought up the subject among themselves isn&#39;t a far fetched idea either. Check out the link below, it&#39;s interesting read on the topic of Walmart and Unions</p>

<p>It&#39;s coming rather you like it or not. Get ready, spiritually. No food, no store, no place is going to keep you safe. Your president is a muslim who hates american exceptionalism. His faith is leading him, he feels just and correct. Hell, your banks at this point worship Satan and are manipulating him! Oh, faith again, yeah we&#39;re not mature enough to discuss it. I will tell you this, prideful man; when they are knocking at your door you will think &quot;oh God!&quot; whose name is Jesus - who you won&#39;t be able to find.</p>

<p>Why do you think he just got done firing so many generals? You still need to ask why they closed these stores? Youtube already has several different sources saying they will use wal-mart for stationing. Stop asking why when your spirit is telling you, stop ignoring the real truth. The ones with wisdom have been trying to get the majority to wake up off their iphone craze, but still, we give our attention to the beast. Pray you are accounted worthy to escape this terrible scenario, /if/ it does burn.</p>

<p>This world is passing away and there is a new order coming</p>

<p>bonus, why use 15:

<p>Soon, surely. This year? Maybe, maybe not. Who knows? No one. People don&#39;t like fire and brimstone being preached at them. Not that I disagree with what you&#39;re saying, but this ain&#39;t the way to approach the situation. Many people are very familiar with the whole end of the world, purified with fire thing. Most have chosen to disregard it, or not regard it at all. Whatever happens, we all made our choices. No point in heckling people for theirs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hear you on the frustration. I wanna scream and shout at times too, but arguing what will happen usually leads no where with most people. I think just trying to love people like we&#39;re supposed to and being a blessing for them rather than a thorn is a better way to approach these things. Otherwise we&#39;re just getting in the way.</p>

<p>As for your second question, I do not know. That is something you&#39;ll have to learn to do yourself.</p>
