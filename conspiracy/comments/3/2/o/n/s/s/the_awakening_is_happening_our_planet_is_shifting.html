        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>EDIT 6/6/15: So in the original post I gave a specific timeline for the appearance of a &quot;radiant change&quot; in the night sky which my <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/377gbe/love_and_light/">autistic friend</a>  (<strong>PLEASE READ THIS LINK IF YOU HAVEN&#39;T</strong>) has been having visions of. We regret doing so, as over the last couple months we have developed a better understanding of what his visions mean and their timeline for manifestation. Please don&#39;t let this detract from the message, which is about shifts. Our reality is shifting, our consciousness is shifting, our planet is shifting all into higher frequencies of vibrations and with it will come a lot of changes. (end edit)</p>

<p>The vibrational rate of our planet will be rising drastically (it has already begun) and it is up to each of us to raise our consciousness with it. Once the desire to awaken spiritually has been grasped, the rest will follow. There will be an undercurrent of increased mind control vibrations brought on deliberately by the &quot;control faction&quot; of this planet which will unfortunately sweep many of us and our brethren into its pull.</p>

<p>Stay Alert</p>

<p>Meditation is the Key</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Welcome back. Unfortunately it appears you may have been handed a portion of disinfo by certain &#39;light workers&#39; and the sort. It happens to the best of us, from time to time. Nevertheless, meditation can certainly be useful, for a variety of reasons. I would recommend the <a href="http://www.holybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/Raja-Yoga.pdf">Raja Yoga</a> and looking into the process of <a href="http://www.themystica.com/mystica/articles/k/kundalini.html">kundalini</a> after some time and practice. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi friend :) I assure you I am on the path to truth. I&#39;m not asking you to believe, but to keep an open mind. </p>

<p>Soon I will share all of the beautiful, profound spiritual experiences I have had. I&#39;m not quite ready yet. But I hope I can count on you to approach them without bias when I do and then come to conclusions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi everyone! First off, I regret putting a definitive date in the OP. I am certain about  changes in the space around our planet incoming but knowing my luck I am off on the timing and people will dismiss it as coincidence. I guess this is how it all works after all.</p>

<p>This will be the first of me participating at a frequent rate but I am still synthesizing everything I&#39;ve been learning. </p>

<p>I want to reiterate the importance of meditation. It will help you see clearly what thoughts are truly yours and what thoughts are a product of the conspiracies we like to discuss in this sub. </p>

<p>The manipulation of our consciousness is happening much deeper than just on a physical level. Keep in mind that all of your hates and fears, all of your vices and all of your inactions are not internal but externally placed upon you. Man is an inherently spiritual being in a state of hypnosis. </p>

<p>This is what the awakening is all about. I&#39;ll be casually posting every day but if anyone wants to dive into a conversation about this please PM me.</p>

<p>Love and Light :)</p>

<p>I have spent years of my life researching the conspiracies that plague our planet. I&#39;ve even written a book on them. But I&#39;ve come to find that the only conspiracy that matters is the concealment of spiritual truth from mankind. Everything else is just a step on the path to this understanding.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are right, but one is not necessarily due to the other, rather, the theme of spiritual advancement is being manifested in multiple ways at the same time. Density of the area of space being moved into reflects on perfect synchronicity the timing of humanity to advance as they have learned (more accurately, will finish learning soon) the lessons of this level of vibration. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I recently watched a documentary that posits that the Sun is in a binary orbit with a brown dwarf star, which gives rise to the 26,000 year precession of the equinoxes, as 26,000 years is the approximate orbital period. I&#39;m inclined to believe this, it would make sense of the fact that ice ages occur regularly at equivalent intervals. It would also explain the fact that every planet in the solar system is experiencing increases in temperature and x-ray emissions, etc. Remember that huge storm that sprung up on Saturn? There are similar disruptions in the Great Red Spot on Jupiter, and Pluto&#39;s atmospheric density has increased by %400 over the past couple decades iirc.<br/>
The theory is that we are approaching perihelion in the orbital cycle and this is responsible for the increased vibrations OP is describing. The effects of this increase on humans, via the pineal gland especially, is another topic lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No messages of doom here :) I am speaking of physical changes in this illusion that will soon be brought about. Usually I would never be interested in predictions but there has been some interesting build up to this one.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also read much of the channeling logs available on the L-L website that I highly recommend. The topics are more down to earth than Ra and provide good context for some of the more esoteric things that Ra talks about. Of course, there is a lot of junk involved as well because they logged every meditation session since 1975 but it&#39;s worth diving into if you have the time.</p>

<p>And for anyone lurking this comment and interested, the Ra material is worth checking out. It&#39;s not the complete truth, which makes sense with the context of spiritual evolution being our goal. Understand that all of the UFO and ancient aliens talk had the purpose of capturing the interest of the channeling group and is not necessarily meant to be taken on the literal level. But everyone should decide for themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As soon as you mentioned &#39;fourth density&#39; I figured there was a good chance it were pertaining to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Law_of_One_%28The_Ra_Material%29">Ra material</a>, or that of so called &#39;light workers&#39;. Overall, I would still recommend reading the Ra material (which can be found <a href="http://www.lawofone.info/">here</a>), however taking it with a grain of salt. As with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Material">Seth material</a>, with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleister_Crowley">Crowley</a>&#39;s <a href="http://hermetic.com/legis/">work</a> care of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aiwass#The_dictation">Aiwass</a>, the claims of the &#39;<a href="http://www.wanttoknow.info/secret_societies/hidden_hand_bloodlines">Hidden Hand</a>&#39;, &#39;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascended_Master_Teachings#The_Individualized_.22I_AM.22_Presence">I AM</a>&#39; material, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koot_Hoomi">Koot Hoomi</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morya_%28Theosophy%29">Master Morya</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djwal_Khul">Djwal Khul</a>, and other so-called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascended_master)">ascended masters</a>, it is incredibly easy for one to simply fabricate the entire message, to consciously or subconsciously alter the message to suit their own agenda, for darker currents to taint portions of the message along the way, etc. In other words, it isn&#39;t advisable to take any of it at face value, rather to take it into deeper consideration in your own process of meditation and/or contemplation, while taking the work of other adepts, of other so-called ascended masters, and the various mystery schools of antiquity, into equal consideration.</p>

<p>If there is any truth to humanity reaching a &#39;fourth density&#39; as some call it, evolving into a group soul complex or re-connecting with an existing group soul complex, it probably isn&#39;t going to happen over night. Some in pockets of the elite believe a &#39;culling&#39; will be necessary for this to occur, a nice way of advocating genocide on a global scale and a perfect of example of darker currents tainting such a concept. In that regard, one should beware of those who parrot disinformation, whether via a third-party or directly to you claiming to be an entity they are not, in claiming any specific date immediately upon us will bring forth some sort of mass transformation. If there&#39;s any truth to this, it would be a gradual process, a culmination of key events (e.g. the advent of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeon_%28Thelema%29#Aeon_of_Horus">Aeon of Horus</a>) spanning decades, centuries or perhaps millennia. That being said, you&#39;re free to believe what you wish, and if you happen to be correct I will be the first to admit I was wrong. On the other hand, if that day arrives and nothing extraordinary occurs, consider it a lesson learned, one we&#39;ve all been through on occasion.</p>

<p>In closing, I would like to direct you to a new subreddit I believe you&#39;ll find of interest: <a href="/r/OccultConspiracy">/r/OccultConspiracy</a>. Be sure to check the second and third pages for additional content, and feel free to contribute anything you consider relevant. Cheers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the thoughts! I&#39;ve always respected your clarity and level headedness. I agree with just about everything you say. I am in the process of discovering my own truth and I admit the texts of channelings from L/L research have contributed.</p>

<p>However I want to assert firmly that I am not listening blindly to any man or entity as I synthesize my understanding and am simply following the incredible synchronicity that has blessed my life recently and it has led to profound changes in my consciousness.</p>

<p>For example, a couple days ago I &quot;severed the cord&quot; to my lower consciousness, as some hermetic texts have termed it. This was the catalyst for me to return and start sharing.</p>

<p>I hope to speak more about everything soon, I am unfortunately having some difficulty constructing a coherent paragraph about all this and will probably wait until I am confident that I can express it in full through text.</p>

<p>Love and Light :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m glad to see that you&#39;re back and willing to contribute, in whatever capacity you see fit. I apologize if I initially came off as overly critical of your perspective. I happen to personally disagree with at least a portion of your theory, however acknowledge that no man is always right, nor should we be. We all make mistakes for a reason, clearly, to learn from them, myself included (and constantly at that). When I was younger, about 17 or so, after 5 or so years of primarily atheism I became fascinated with the Pleiadian theory, of course being young I lost all interest in it shortly after. A few years back I happen to have delved heavily into the Seth material, and eventually the Ra material, however since have become more interested in a topic I had always found intriguing: the roots of hermeticism, esotericism and how these concepts had influenced history over the centuries and will. I look forward to hearing more of what you&#39;ve discovered, and will certainly take it all into consideration as well. </p>
