        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In the past few months, the news headlines have been filled with stories about the benefits of vaccines. President Barack Obama, neither a doctor nor a medical specialist, stated unequivocally <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/01/barack-obama-kids-vaccinated-measles_n_6591452.html">&quot;you should get your kids vaccinated&quot;</a>, quite different from his 2008 position that <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2015/feb/03/What-Barack-Obama-said-about-autism-and-vaccines/">&quot;the science right now is inconclusive&quot;</a>. But enough about what the media and politicians say, let&#39;s take a look at some facts that might not be familiar to the general public.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>According to <a href="http://healthsentinel.com/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2654:united-states-disease-death-rates&amp;catid=55:united-states-deaths-from-diseases&amp;Itemid=55">official data</a>, in the United States <a href="http://healthsentinel.com/joomla/images/stories/graphs/us-deaths-1900-1965.jpg">mortality rates from many communicable diseases trended to practically zero before the introduction of vaccines</a>. This dramatic reduction in mortality seen in multiple communicable diseases cannot be attributed to vaccines, and was instead due to increased sanitation, clean water, improved nutrition, and healthcare practices. This same trend of <a href="http://healthsentinel.com/joomla/images/stories/graphs/uk-deaths-1901-1965.jpg">reduction in mortality rates prior to any vaccine introduction</a> is evident in the <a href="http://healthsentinel.com/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2653:england-and-wales-death-rates&amp;catid=54:england-and-wales-death-rates&amp;Itemid=55">official data</a> from England and Wales as well. The data show that many of these communicable diseases ceased to be life-threatening to the general public before the advent of vaccination.</p></li>
<li><p>There have never been any longterm double-blind placebo control studies of vaccines, either individually or as the entire US schedule. In studies of vaccines in humans, vaccines are compared with earlier versions of vaccines as the placebo, and never a saline solution. Longterm double-blind placebo controlled studies are the gold standard for proving medical safety, and vaccines are the only medical treatment you can receive in a US hospital that has never undergone that testing. <a href="http://www.ane.pl/pdf/7020.pdf">This</a> is the only study I can find of the US vaccine schedule that uses a placebo control group. It was done in infant macaques, and found signficantly altered amygdala development in the group receiving vaccines. It was never pursued, and clearly shows the abysmal state of research and the desperate need for further investigation.</p></li>
<li><p>We have no official tracking of vaccine outcomes, and doctors do not report vaccine injury to any central location. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/22336803/">Here</a> is a meta-study about the MMR vaccine in particular where the authors conclude that &quot;the design and reporting of safety outcomes in MMR vaccine studies, both pre- and post-marketing, are largely inadequate. The evidence of adverse events following immunisation with the MMR vaccine cannot be separated from its role in preventing the target diseases.&quot; Even with the full array of available studies, they find that there is simply not enough data to make a determination.</p></li>
<li><p>VAERS (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_Adverse_Event_Reporting_System">Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System</a>) is the only database tracking any vaccine injuries in the US. This unofficial database, which most Americans have never heard of, still receives 10,000-20,000 reports of adverse events from vaccines each year. There is no official investigation into any of these reports. This is evidence of injury that demands further investigation. We cannot state anything about the safety of vaccines if we do not track the outcomes.</p></li>
<li><p>The US vaccine schedule has <a href="http://www.nvic.org/CMSTemplates/NVIC/pdf/49-Doses-PosterB.pdf">increased dramatically since the 1980s</a> with no longterm testing of how that might affect development. In 1983, the CDC recommended 23 doses of 7 vaccines (DPT, MMR, Polio) between two months and age six. In 2013, the CDC recommended 49 doses of 14 vaccines between day of birth and age six and 69 doses of 16 vaccines between day of birth and age 18. In 1983, the CDC directed doctors to give a child no more than 4 vaccines (DPT, polio) simultaneously. By 2013, the CDC directed that a child can receive 8 or more vaccines at once. The longterm safety of this increase and how it might affect development has not been studied.</p></li>
<li><p>In 2011 the US Supreme Court ruled that <a href="http://www.nvic.org/NVIC-Vaccine-News/March-2011/No-Pharma-Liability--No-Vaccine-Mandates-.aspx">federal law prohibits parents from suing drug makers over serious side effects from childhood vaccines</a>. The only personal defense left to individual Americans, the lawsuit, cannot be used to seek compensation from vaccine injury. Tort law has traditionally been the only way for the citizen to seek redress from corporations. There is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutter_Laboratories">history of mistakes in the manufacturing of vaccines with lethal consequences</a>, so much so that the slang term &quot;hot lot&quot; has been coined to describe a defective and potentially dangerous batch of vaccines.</p></li>
<li><p>To date, NVIP (the <a href="http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/index.html">National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program</a>) has awarded <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/nvpo/nvac/meetings/pastmeetings/2012/evans_062512.pdf">$2.44 billion of taxpayer dollars</a> to victims of vaccine injury. In other industries, fines like these are considered the cost of doing business. These claims of injury are not heard in a federal or state civil court, but instead a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_court">vaccine court</a> sitting with no jury. As a result of some of the large compensations the court has awarded, <a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/357/13/1275">most DPT vaccine makers have ceased production</a>. In 2008 the federal government agreed to award damages to the family of Hannah Poling, <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=87974932">a girl who developed autistic-like symptoms after receiving a series of vaccines in a single day</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-106hhrg73042/html/CHRG-106hhrg73042.htm">Members of the CDC and FDA responsible for licensing and recommending vaccines are permitted to have financial stakes in those vaccines</a>. &quot;The CDC grants conflict of interest waivers to every member of their advisory committee a year at a time, and allows full participation in the discussions leading up to a vote by every member, whether they have a financial stake in the decision or not. So they&#39;re discussing it, influencing other members possibly, whether they have a financial stake or not.&quot; <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/nvpo/nvac/meetings/pastmeetings/shuchat_062912.pdf">Meanwhile, the cost to vaccinate one child with the full US schedule increased from $70 in 1990 to $1,712 in 2012 (p.16)</a>. There is absolutely no debate on this matter; conflicts of interest should not be allowed when the health and future of our children are at stake.</p></li>
<li><p>There are alternatives to blind mass vaccination, specifically the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1082657/">Leicester Method</a>, which involves isolation of cases and only select vaccination of direct contacts. The town of Leicester in England suffered one of the highest mortality rates from smallpox in the early 1800s, while having one of the highest vaccination rates. They decided as a town to stop blind mass-population vaccinations, and instead focus on isolation of cases. By the time they had reached rates of only 5% vaccinated, they had one of the lowest mortality rates recorded from smallpox. There is compelling evidence from the available official data that <a href="http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/wallace/S616.htm">the smallpox vaccine had no effect on the mortality rates from smallpox</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The US government has been suing Merck for several years in an ongoing private case that alleges that Merck attempted to <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/pharmalot/2014/09/10/did-merck-unfairly-monopolize-the-market-for-a-mumps-vaccine/">&quot;defraud the United States through an ongoing scheme to sell the government a mumps vaccine that is mislabeled, misbranded, adulterated, and falsely certified as having an efficacy rate that is significantly higher than it actually is&quot;</a>. Although this case has been ongoing for several years, all of the details are closed to the public and concerned individual citizens.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I have documented a lack of research into vaccines; I have documented evidence of injury from vaccines; I have documented conflicts of interest in vaccine approval; I have documented ongoing court cases about vaccine fraud. I never wanted to be an anti-vaxxer, but when I add up the facts on my own (instead of what is represented in the media) I don&#39;t end up at the conclusion that anyone who doesn&#39;t vaccinate is the largest and most immediate threat to my life. Instead I am forced to conclude that this a complex issue, and the science is far from settled.</p>

It&#39;s an eye-opener.</p>

<li><p>You have no idea what is inside of the vaccine. You could study it&#39;s production, the nurse administering it, etc. etc. do you really want to trust that many different hands with something you have to inject into your blood stream when the human race can&#39;t even get the condiments on your cheeseburger right at mcdonalds?</p></li>
<li><p>with many vaccines, you will require regular booster shots indefinitely, if you forget one you are more likely to transmit the disease than you would have been previously, had you built up a natural immunity to it.</p></li>
<li><p>there are other ways of preventing disease even medically, which can be administered orally for instance, instead of through a needle, say for example a vitamin supplement (to boost your immune system). (the point is there are alternatives in the field of preventative medicine, why are people so sold on this particular form of preventative medicine?)</p></li>
<li><p>many vaccines have known side effects, and many vaccine producing companies have been caught lying about them. even when you are reading the &quot;facts&quot; you are likely landing nowhere near the truth</p></li>
<li><p>i have personally seen and watched get debunked, a woman post a facebook status that was 100% propaganda, from Ontario, Canada claiming her child got sick at the hospital, and blamed anti-vaxxers (like they were terrorists) for her child&#39;s illness. people here debunked who she was, and linked her family back to big pharma rather easily, and to me it proved without a shadow of a doubt they were spending money to manipulate public opinion if necessary. her child was not sick. i don&#39;t have the link but will gladly search for it if necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>the never ending number of threads like this one, that contain actual informed information and not crazy extremist opinion from &quot;caring mothers&quot; who fear for their child&#39;s life every time they cross the road because of some disease nobody has had to seriously worry about since the industrial revolution.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>if you really want me to continue i can but ill more than likely have to go back and elaborate on these points as people try and refute them. i will continue if you don&#39;t think i have 94 or so more reasons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s just common knowledge; having a vaccine that has worn off makes you much more likely to be a carrier than actually contracting the virus and developing an immunity since that kind of immunity is actually life-long.  It should basically go without saying that you are less likely to transmit a disease that you have an immunity to than one that you do not, so the bolded part of the sentence logically follows from the first part.  Go to the CDC website, they have all the information on exactly how long the vaccines are supposed to last (it&#39;s not forever).</p>

<p>Now after doing some research, ive come to the conclusion that vaccines are quackery.</p>

<p>Why didnt you get rabies this year? Because your dog got vaccinated? Have you ever come across an animal with rabies? Why not? Because your dog got vaccinated? But why did your dog need vaccination against a disease that you could just as easily get from a raccoon or a bat? Are raccoons or bats vaccinated? No? So how do they avoid getting rabies? The same way you do... and it doesnt involve a vaccine... think it through...</p>

To even understand vaccines you must first know that and some basic immunology. I cant come on here and teach a whole class on immunology.

    <div class="md"><p>No you didnt. The problem people have with vaccines isn&#39;t whether or not the basic concept works. The problem is the various unrelated to disease elements found within vaccines, aluminum, mercury, and other known poisonous substances that have been found in several different vaccines. Also the apparent relation between vaccines and various mental ailments (likely caused by the above and other not listed poisonous substances.) The various instances of disease outbreaks within populations of vaccinated individuals. And the infringement of basic human rights that comes with mandatory vaccinations. The public has no way of knowing what is actually in the vaccines being administered to them. </p>

<p>You are simply speaking of the basic concept of what vaccines were initially created for. You have not once addressed any of the actual issues that people have with vaccines, which is what this thread is about. I&#39;m wondering why you are even participating in this thread when you have offered nothing of any substantial value to the conversation. My issue with this is that people like you, who try to over simplify an issue, distract the readers of the conversation from the actual problem at hand. The thread is not talking about whether or not the original idea behind vaccinations is a valid one. So, if you are going to come into a thread and disagree with the conspiracy put forth, you should actually address the topic at hand.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not really sure why I&#39;m replying to your useless comments at all, I just smelled shill I guess. Seems like  misdirection, meant to convince those who aren&#39;t experienced in the topic at hand that the entire conspiracy is invalid due to some obscure, unrelated (specifically) part of &quot;high school biology.&quot; Sneaky tactic for disinformation agenda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How could you possibly know that for sure? The whole point of the conspiracy is that they can lie to us about things like that, and they are certainly pushing for mandatory vaccines. Especially for children in public schools. In several parts of the country they are pushing laws that remove the ability for parents to opt out of vaccines due to personal beliefs. Everything you&#39;re saying may be what we are told, but that doesn&#39;t mean that they are telling the truth. And I didn&#39;t read any comments in that thread that asked what the original purpose was... It seemed that the thread was questioning the very things that you are referring to. Everything you&#39;re saying seems to be a regurgitation of the exact same statements that this thread is questioning. Its very difficult to believe the mainstream take on these things when the pharmaceutical industry is in the pocket of lobbyists and a for profit industry. The industry isn&#39;t built for the benefit of the people, it is built to create as much profit is possible, which is why the people here are questioning the truth and validity of the things we are told about vaccines. Especially when there has been such an incredible influx of pro-vaccine propaganda in recent months alongside an increased demonization of those who are against taking vaccines on blind faith. The public has no way of knowing what is actually contained within the vaccines we are given, which to me provides adequate reasons for questioning the entire field. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t you realize this proves my point for me?</p>

<p>&quot;We conclude that the new live, oral ADV-4 and ADV-7 vaccine is safe and effective for use in <strong>groups represented by the study population</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t a <strong>longterm</strong> study in the first place, and it only studied healthy adults (specifically military recruits, an even smaller and more unique sub-group which tends to higher levels of physical health).</p>

<p>Also, the ADV vaccine is not on the CDC&#39;s US recommended schedule.</p>

<p>Now THAT is a false statement, with no evidence to back it up. No, not every company is &quot;dirty&quot; and it is unfortunate you think this way.</p>

<p>If the facts are very clear, please outline them here for us in this forum we are using to debate the very topic.</p>

<p>&quot;In no way does does preparing the body to make anti bodies against a specific pathogen make a person more vulnerable.&quot;</p>

<p>... which is why those patients often get sick from the very illness they were supposedly protected from.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Almost all vaccines are designed to elicit an antibody response, which is essentially the measure of humoral immunity, this is also why they put in so many adjuvants such as aluminum.  There are many more factors that play into cell-mediated immunity, many are not properly understood.  This is why 5 years after pertussis vaccination, a vaccinated individual has the same resistance as an unvaccinated individual.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I started off neither pro or anti, actually I really didn&#39;t care either way. I&#39;d been jabbed in the arm with various shots when I was a kid, I think we all had. But we&#39;ve gone from a situation where 1/10,000 kids have autism to today where it&#39;s 1/68. Other than vaccination there isn&#39;t any any real explanation as to this massive increase. Some of the pro-vax no rights extremists will just write off the entire rise as simply an increase in diagnosis, but the reality is the increase is real. According to the MSM science has dis-proven the link between vaccines and autism, case closed. In fact the official position of the IOM is that no further research should be done. Can you imagine any scientist endorsing that position ? The troubling part is when you look at the science they are relying upon to disprove this link you&#39;ll find it&#39;s not there. The study 2004 study done by the CDC, one of the authors involved said they found a link, and then he was ordered by his higher ups to make it go away. Then there were the Danish autism studies, of which were headed by a guy that made the top 10 OIG list for fraud (poul thorsen), due to stealing all the grant money. They came out with a study that also disproved the link. But what they had done was, after thiomersal was &#39;removed&#39; from the shots, they added outpatients to the numbers of cases they counted. This would have been fine, probably, other than the fact they didn&#39;t use a relative value. They counted absolute cases. This isn&#39;t science, it&#39;s some kind of ridiculous joke. And every time you hear the talking about say, the issue has been proved, these are the studies they are talking about. It&#39;s a fucking scandal. The worst part is, most of the gullible public believe whatever fairly tale the media will spin them. The other fucking lie people swallow is the mercury has been removed from the shots. Yes they removed it from the pediatric vaccines (although it may still be present in trace amounts), but they added a recommendation that pregnant women get the flu shot, and the child every year. So the amount of mercury kids are getting was about half of its peak.</p>

<p>This is wrong, there are plenty of other things that have changed as well (see the famous pirates vs global warming graph). </p>

<p>Perhaps it&#39;s global mean CO2 ppm, or the fact that older mothers are known to have high-risk children (and people are having kids later now), or maybe it&#39;s BPA from thermally-printed receipts causing a prion-disease we won&#39;t detect for another 10 years. </p>

<p>My point isn&#39;t that <em>vaccines do NOT cause autism</em>, it&#39;s that you can&#39;t logically say it does without some sort of real evidence. &quot;What else could do it?&quot; is not a valid argument. </p>

<li>A study published in the journal Annals of Epidemiology has shown that giving the Hepatitis B vaccine to newborn baby boys could triple the risk of developing an autism spectrum disorder compared to boys who were not vaccinated as neonates. The research was conducted at Stony Brook University Medical Center, NY.</li>

<li>A study published in the Journal of Inorganic Biochemistry by researchers at the Neural Dynamics Group, Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences at the University of British Columbia determined that Aluminum, a highly neurotoxic metal and the most commonly used vaccine adjuvant may be a significant contributing factor to the rising prevalence of ASD in the Western World. They showed that the correlation between ASD prevalence and the Aluminum adjuvant exposure appears to be the highest at 3-4 months of age. The studies also show that children from countries with the highest ASD appear to have a much higher exposure to Aluminum from vaccines. The study points out that several prominent milestones of brain development coincide with major vaccination periods for infants. These include the onset of synaptogenesis (birth), maximal growth velocity of the hippocampus and the onset of amygdala maturation. Furthermore, major developmental transition in many bio-behavioural symptoms such as sleep, temperature regulation, respiration and brain wave patterns, all of which are regulated by the neuroendocrine network. Many of these aspects of brain function are known to be impaired in autism, such as sleeping and brain wave patterns.</li>

<p>According to the FDA, vaccines represent a special category of drugs as they are generally given to healthy individuals. Further according to the FDA, “this places significant emphasis on their vaccine safety”. While the FDA does set an upper limit for Aluminum in vaccines at no more that 850/mg/dose, it is important to note that this amount was selected empirically from data showing that Aluminum in such amounts enhanced the antigenicity of the vaccine, rather than from existing safety. Given that the scientific evidence appears to indicate that vaccine safety is not as firmly established as often believed, it would seem ill advised to exclude paediatric vaccinations as a possible cause of adverse long-term neurodevelopment outcomes , including those associated with autism.</p>

<ol>
<li>A study published in the Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health, Part A: Current Issues by the Department of Economics and Finance at the University of New York shows how researchers suspect one or more environmental triggers are needed to develop autism, regardless of whether individuals have a genetic predisposition or not. They determined that one of those triggers might be the “battery of vaccinations that young children receive.” Researchers found a positive and statistically significant relationship between autism and vaccinations. They determined that the higher the proportion of children receiving recommended vaccinations, the higher the prevalence of autism. A 1 % increase in vaccination was associated with an additional 680 children having autism. The results suggest that vaccines may be linked to autism and encourages more in depth study before continually administering these vaccines.</li>

<li>A study published in the Journal of Toxicology by the Department of Neurosurgery at The Methodist Neurological Institute in Houston has shown that ASD is a disorder caused by a problem in brain development. They looked at B-cells and their sensitivity levels to thimerosal, a commonly used additive in many vaccines. They determined that ASD patients have a heightened sensitivity to thimerosal which would restrict cell proliferation that is typically found after vaccination. The research shows that individuals who have this hypersensitivity to thimerosal could make them highly susceptible to toxins like thimerosal, and that individuals with a mild mitochondrial defect may be affected by thimerosal. The fact that ASD patients’ B cells exhibit hypersensitivity to thimerosal tells us something.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Criticism --A new study based out of Australia supervised by epidemiologist Guy Eslick, and primarily conduced by two researchers Taylor, and Swerdfeger (excluded credentials) is now circulating the Internet.  Let us review the details...</p>

<p>Study
Taylor, L., Swerdfeger, A., Eslick, G. (2014). Vaccines are not associated with autism: An evidence-based meta-analysis of case-control and cohort studies. Vaccine. Retrieved from <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/20127097/Vaccines_Autism.pdf">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/20127097/Vaccines_Autism.pdf</a></p>

<p>Corresponding author: <a href="mailto:guy.eslick@sydney.edu.au">guy.eslick@sydney.edu.au</a> (G.D. Eslick).
Inclusion Criteria--
The inclusion criteria contradicts the study’s title “Vaccines”, which by presumption include the  full compliment of the 71 doses of vaccine prior to 18 years of age in the United States (CDC, 2014).  The study only looked at thimerosal containing, and MMR vaccines, which excluded; rotavirus, haemophilus influenzae type b (HIB), pneumococcal, poliovirus, partial influenza doses, varicella, hepatitis A, human papillomavirus (HPV), and partial meningococcal.  The old studies did include some of the Hepatitis B, and DTP, which included cumulative Hg dosage, and the MMR, however left out the subsequent nine vaccines.  Further, these vaccines are only recommended among the pediatric population in the United States, additional vaccines are recommended among the broader adult, and immigrant populations.  ASD diagnosis had to be included in the research study in correlation with the MMR vaccine and cumulative mercury (Hg) dosage.  This study repeatedly speaks of &quot;cumulative mercury dosage&quot;, meaning that there was not a comparison between vaccinated verses unvaccinated.  They simply studied individuals that had some mercury compared with other groups that had more.  For example, smoking a few cigarettes a day, compared to those that smoke a pack a day shows no correlation to lung cancer, therefore smoking is safe.  This was their inclusion criteria in a nutshell...</p>

<p>Exclusion Criteria---
The exclusion criteria was broad.  Studies that focused on the other nine vaccines were removed from the review.  Many of these studies have been directly linked with autism like HIB, but were purposefully excluded  (Richmand BJ., 2011).  All data collected from VAERS was also excluded, however the supervising contributor Guy Eslick in a contradiction encouraged parents to report adverse events in this study even though he discounts those reports. </p>

<p>Results---
929 studies were primarily selected from four data banks; Medline, PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar.  Only 5 made the inclusion criteria; Andrews, Hviid, Madsen, Uchiyama, and Verstraeten.  The authors claim that all of the studies prove vaccines (MMR, &amp; thimerosal) do not cause autism.  Two studies focused on the MMR vaccine, two on cumulative Hg dosage, and one study looked at two data sets of Hg exposure. </p>

<p>After viewing the p-value results I immediately know that the researchers must have set the “level of statistical significance” or alpha higher than 0.05 (Burns, B., Grove, S., pg. 377).  I would have preferred all the p-values to be &lt; 0.01 especially when consenting to a medical procedure (vaccination) due to the known risks involved (autism).  Decreasing alpha to 0.01 will decrease Type I errors and increase Type II errors.  A Type I error states; “something is significant when it is not” (Burns, B., Grove, S., pg. 377).  Inversely a Type II error would say that something was not significant when it was, so it would err on the side of caution especially when using pharmaceuticals as your independent variable.  So in these articles that would translate as a Type I error showing that vaccinations were statistically significant in not being causal in autism when in fact they were. </p>

<p>Limitations---
The authors admit that two of the Denmark studies capture the same data cohort, creating sampling duplication.  Further, they also state the Uchiyama and Madsen study are biased.  Closer observations of four studies are discussed below.  The authors not only focused their meta-analysis on only one vaccine and one ingredient, they also did not include any studies looking at outcomes from vaccinated verses unvaccinated populations. </p>

<p>Interesting Notes</p>

<p>Vaccine Induced Herd Immunity - Vaccine induced immunity wanes, which is well understood in the scientific literature.  Natural immunity is life-long and it is under this basis that the theory of herd immunity exists.  Peer-review also shows that boosters are shorter lasting then initial injections so if the MMR only last 2 to 10 years (if at all) then the booster would last much less.  Patients who are 50 should have at least 4 to 6 injections of the MMR to be considered immune.  There are very few in this population (baby boomers) that are compliant with the CDC’s requirements.  This subpopulation makes up 50% or more of the U.S. population and yet there is not a measles epidemic in the United States as promised by vaccine promoters.  Vaccine derived herd immunity has not persisted in the United States for at least 40 years, and we have not seen a resurgent of massive infectious disease epidemics.  Vaccine induced herd immunity is used by public-health officials and providers to frighten those to adhere to a vaccine policy that is not even grounded in the belief system they propagate.  This proves that there is no justification in forced vaccination.  In a recent outbreak the issue of measles spreading to adults with no immunity is discussed.  The population that they presume is the least immune to measles are those born between 1970 and 1985 (Frketich, 2013).  This is blamed on the “youngish adults” not having had the natural infection and not being vaccine compliant.  So here again we find the level of presumed “herd immunity” well below the needed rate to prevent massive disease outbreaks and yet the disease is relatively non existent.</p>

<p>MMR Vaccine Benefit Outweighs Risk - They ignored data, which states; Vaccine induced autism risk (0.6%) calculated against the risk of natural measles mortality (0.1-0.3%), which demonstrates undue risk through the overuse of vaccines (Ewing, G., 2009).</p>

<p>Cochrane Review Claims No Link Between MMR And Autism - It appears the authors did not weight the interpretation by the quality of the evidence Cochrane presented instead they simply quoted anything that supported their theory.  Cochrane&#39;s conslusions were; &quot;The design and reporting of safety outcomes in MMR vaccine studies, both pre- and post-marketing, are largely inadequate.  The evidence of adverse events following immunisation with the MMR vaccine cannot be separated from its role in preventing the target diseases&quot; (Demicheli et al., 2012).  This is a far cry from a simplistic definitive statement that there is no link between vaccine/autism causation. 
Verstraeten Study - The authors claim that the Verstraeten study shows no correlation between vaccines and autism, but Verstraeten himself disagrees with their conclusion.  In a letter to the journal of Pediatrics Dr. Vestraeten expresses concerns that his study is being used to prove no correlation between thimerosal and neurodevelopmental delays.&quot;Surprisingly, however, the study is being interpreted now as negative [where ‘negative’ implies no association was shown] by many…. The article does not state that we found evidence against an association, as a negative study would. It does state, on the contrary, that additional study is recommended, which is the conclusion to which a neutral study must come… A neutral study carries a very distinct message: the investigators could neither confirm nor exclude an association, and therefore more study is required&quot; (Verstraeten, T., 2004).</p>

<p>Summary---
This is a failed attempt in gaining public confidence in vaccine policy.  The authors used flawed data to create a perception of safety, which is not only dishonest, but dangerous.</p>

<p>Big news networks are reporting on a <a href="http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2275444">study just released</a> that indicates no risk of autism from the MMR vaccine. I don&#39;t doubt the validity of the study, but it seems like a big conflict of interests that the study was done by <a href="http://www.lewin.com/">The Lewin Group</a>, which is owned by the largest private health insurance company in the US (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UnitedHealth_Group">UnitedHealth Group</a>). What&#39;s also misleading about these articles is I think a lot of people will just read the headline and use this to justify all vaccines as being safe.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying all vaccines are bad, but let&#39;s not forget that there&#39;s a lot of money involved and that we gave the Nobel prize to the inventor of the lobotomy. Science is still a field of exploration and experimentation.</p>

<p>Thimerosal is to mercury as salt is to chlorine.</p>

<p>There have been at least equivalent correlations between paternal age at time of conception and autism.</p>

<p>Real studies do need to be done on vaccines. Interestingly enough, it does appear that the government and big pharma are being more truthful than anti-vax.</p>

<p>I say this because of the difference in the type of information each &quot;side&quot; of the issue provides willingly and openly.</p>

<p>I can go to government and big pharma sites and see clear evidence that, in at least some cases, some vaccines do harm some people some of the time and some vaccines aren&#39;t as effective as their advertising would lead you to believe.</p>

<p>However, if you go to an anti-vac source, <strong>all</strong> vaccines are evil and deadly and <strong>none</strong> is in the least bit effective. I already know that to be a blatant lie, so I know I can&#39;t trust them, period.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True. The digestive system filters <em>some</em> things out, but its primary purpose is to transfer what you eat into your bloodstream so your body can use it.</p>

<p>The appendix is pretty good at pulling poisons out of your digestive system, until it gets too full and ruptures.</p>

<p>But the whole system overall isn&#39;t perfect. It can&#39;t perfectly identify all poisons, nor can it perfectly protect you from them. If it could, we&#39;d never have to worry about eating hemlock or arsenic or limit our tuna intake because of mercury (especially pregnant ladies). That former Russian spy wouldn&#39;t have died from Cesium poisoning. We wouldn&#39;t care about fluoride in our water or Monsanto herbicides and pesticides on our fruits and vegetables. Hell, kids wouldn&#39;t have to worry about their peanut allergies, right? We&#39;d just shit all the bad stuff out.</p>

<p>So the digestive system does put plenty of poisons into your bloodstream, if you ingest them.</p>

<p>So you&#39;re really looking at two different things - the chemicals themselves and how much of them you&#39;re really getting from various sources.</p>

<p>First off is the actual chemical compound. Thimerosal vs. Mercury. Salt vs. Chlorine. Those are similar.  </p>

<p>Chlorine on its own is a poison. But combined with another element it becomes less poisonous - table salt. You can still kill yourself by ingesting too much salt... but it&#39;s going to take a lot more salt than it would take straight chlorine, and the cause of death would be related to salt intake, not chlorine poisoning.</p>

<p>Likewise, Thimerosal - the component of vaccines that the anti-vac crowd likes to call &quot;mercury&quot; - isn&#39;t mercury. It contains mercury, just like salt contains chlorine.</p>

<p>Looking at dosages then, the interesting thing that I found with regard to Thimerosal and mercury was that even if Thimerosal <em>was</em> 100% mercury, the dosage in any vaccine that contains it is many hundreds of times smaller than the dosage that anyone will get from eating a single serving of tuna fish.</p>

<p>And, as I said, the digestive system will filter out some of that, but not all of it. Your kid is going to get more mercury into their bloodstream every time you feed him or her a can of tuna than they would from a vaccine. (I think only the influenza vaccines contain this stuff though, and I&#39;m generally opposed to influenza vaccines unless the recipient has a legitimate risk of serious harm if they catch it - elderly or infirm.)</p>

<p>The anti-vac movement won&#39;t tell you all this, though. They lie when they suggest that Thimerosal is mercury. Then they lie when they suggest that the dosage is significant. They don&#39;t compare it to the dosage of actual mercury you get from tuna. They just want you to not vaccinate your kids.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why the anti-vac movement doesn&#39;t want you to vaccinate your kids, but I do have my theories. My theories don&#39;t matter though. What matters is, they are lying, it&#39;s clear that they are lying, so what are you going to do about it?</p>

<p>People who care... people who actually want to be informed... are sort of stuck doing that research for themselves.</p>

<p>Not just research into Thimerosal and mercury, but also formaldehyde and aluminum. Actual, honest research will show you that there is both safety and concern in those 3 ingredients, depending on which one you&#39;re talking about.</p>

<p>Then people should research the actual effectiveness of the vaccines as reported by the CDC and pharmaceutical companies.  Doing that research, you will find that some vaccines are very effective and some are just about as effective as not vaccinating... so why get the ones that fall into the latter category? Yeah, the big pharma and CDC data actually shows you that some vaccines change infection rates and outcomes by precisely zero, but you have to be able to link several different pieces of data from different places together to find that.</p>

<p>Oh... and <em>some</em> vaccines actually have not been tested in any honest scientific study. For anything. Even safety. Yeah, you can find that data right on the pharma and CDC sites. </p>

<p>Some though... not all. Just a few.</p>

<p>You have to research each vaccine yourself, because nobody - <strong>nobody</strong> - is telling the whole truth or acting in your best interest.</p>

<p>Nope. Not even close.</p>

<p>First off, the stuff in the vaccine isn&#39;t mercury, any more than salt is chlorine.</p>

<p>There are <a href="http://www.nrdc.org/health/effects/mercury/files/mercury-in-tuna-calculation-summary.pdf">60 micrograms of mercury per can of tuna</a></p>

<p>There is zero mercury in any vaccine I can find. If you can find a vaccine in which mercury is a listed ingredient, please provide a link to the ingredient list.</p>

<p>Vaccines that contain Thimerosal, which is 50% mercury by chemical composition just like table salt is about 50% chlorine by chemical composition, have between 0.3 and 24.5 micrograms of the stuff.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Tell me, what are your thoughts on squalene in vaccines</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With the research I have now done, I have been challenged to find evidence of squalene in any vaccine used in the typical protocol in the USA.</p>

<p>It has been approved for one vaccine that I can find that&#39;s part of an emergency protocol being stockpiled in case of an H5N1 Bird Flu epidemic (<a href="http://www.nvic.org/FDA-Approves-Squalene-H5N1-Bird-Flu-Vaccine.aspx">source</a>). It also appears to be present in trace amounts (maximum 9 parts per billion) in some Anthrax vaccines administered by the US military to US military personnel.</p>

<p>It also seems like it might be an ingredient in some influenza vaccines used in Europe, so Europeans should probably dig in more deeply than I have, if they intend to use an influenza vaccine.</p>

<p>Because this is not a vaccine that I believe will ever be called for, for anyone I care about, there seems to be little reason for me to research it further.</p>

<p>But I kept going a bit and found this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Squalene is also made in our livers and is found in our bloodstreams.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, just because our bodies make it doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s safe in large quantities. Our bodies make formaldehyde naturally too, but put enough of it in there from outside sources and all of a sudden we&#39;re better preserved, and less alive, than a Twinkie.</p>

<p>Then this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Squalene is a natural 30-carbon organic compound originally obtained for commercial purposes primarily from shark liver oil</p>

<p>Squalene is a hydrocarbon and a triterpene, and is a natural and vital part of the synthesis of all plant and animal sterols, including cholesterol, steroid hormones, and vitamin D in the human body.</p>

<p>Squalene has been proposed to be an important part of the Mediterranean diet as it may be a chemopreventive substance that protects people from cancer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(The American Cancer Society has a page debunking its chemopreventive properties.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Squalene is one of the most common lipids produced by human skin cells.</p>

<p>Squalene is also found in a variety of foods (for example: eggs, olive oil (0.7%). cookies, yeast, meat),
cosmetics (for example: eye makeup, lipstick, baby powder), over-the-counter medications, and health
supplements. Squalene in olive oil may contribute to the low cholesterol levels of people who consume
Mediterranean-style diets (Smith, 2000). People can purchase squalene at health food stores. It is more
commonly known as “shark liver oil.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can&#39;t find any compelling evidence of harm.</p>

<p>Even in the article you quoted in the link:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because the squalene will be injected in the presence of a pathogen during the H1N1 vaccination, it will cause an immune response against not only the pathogen, but to the squalene itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a bold statement for which there does not seem to be any, let alone relevant, scientific evidence. It&#39;s not even logical. I mean, if I eat a banana that someone with a cold sneezed on, I would expect my immune system to attack the cold virus, but I wouldn&#39;t expect it to attack the banana. If you include water in an influenza vaccine, your body isn&#39;t going to attack the water. Why would it attack squalene, a substance which it manufactures?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s not possible, I&#39;m saying it&#39;s an illogical, bold, reaching statement and I require legitimate evidence to believe those.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In independent studies where squalene laced vaccines were injected into guinea pigs, the resultant autoimmune disorders killed 14 out of 15. A later test, to verify the results had the same outcome.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Would like to see evidence tying the autoimmune disorders specifically to the squalene. Should be possible to do that fairly easily. Just inject the guinea pigs with a mixture of water and squalene, with the squalene equivalent to the dosage in the vaccines.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When first injected via the anthrax vaccine in Gulf War 1, it permanently disabled many of the soldiers who received it, due to the effects now known as the Gulf War Syndrome.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, no evidence provided to support the statement that it was specifically squalene, nor even the anthrax vaccine, that did that.</p>

<p>I see a lot of rhetoric and absolutely no science. I can&#39;t base decisions that could impact the lives of people I care about on rhetoric. I need real, scientific proof.</p>

<p>The science does tell me that some of the vaccines used in the typical US protocol are troubling. But squalene does not appear to be an ingredient in any vaccine in the US protocol and, even if it were, I can&#39;t find any compelling evidence - any evidence at all - that it&#39;s potentially harmful.</p>

<p>If you believe science is ever &#39;settled,&#39; you&#39;re simply adhering to a dogmatic interpretation of our current knowledge base, while refusing to allow for the possibility that new data could change things.  That&#39;s religion, not science.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That? The old thimerosal band wagon? Besides the fact that isn&#39;t the topic at hand, scheduled vaccines no longer have thimerosal. Mixed conclusions? Way to be misleading like that is some proof of vaccines being ineffective. Yes lots of the time the ideal anti body is not found that means nothing except we need more funding to find the right one. The scientific community is not as swayed as you try to insinuate by &quot;big pharma&quot;. Vaccines are a very basic and well understood science, that&#39;s why there is no debate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is true that vaccines are a very crude and basic form of science (words spoken by the creator of MMR), but the human immune system is vastly complex and not well understood.</p>

<p>There are still some vaccines with thimerosal on the recommended schedule, check the CDC website.  A couple I can think of off the top of my head are meningococcal and diptheria-tetanus from Sanofi.</p>

<p>Look I&#39;m all for independent funding and research on vaccines, and I wish they were strictly under the control of governments and had no profit incentive.  Pharma has been astoundingly successful at hiding their vaccine failures over the years, and continues to make ludicrous profit off the taxpayers.  Some of their products do what they claim to do, others have abysmal efficacy (but you&#39;d never know because the virus in question is so rare and largely asymptomatic anyways), and almost all of them have needlessly dangerous adjuvants. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I can&#39;t find anything about that. If you are talking about the whole bull crap about the &quot;flu vaccine&quot; not being as effective last year then that doesn&#39;t mean what you think it does. Scientists go out and look for what types of flu are circulating in the environment and then create a vaccine according to that. However last year they weren&#39;t able to predict the right ones. Surprise surprise though their budget was slashed before that so they couldn&#39;t do as good of a job. I know multiple virologists that worked on it that were complaining about it and simply shrugged their shoulders saying what do you expect? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hello,
a quick number of things you may want to doublecheck and fix (number are related to your number).
1. Your images-link are not informative. Although the images you link do show a decrease in observed deaths per capita, there is no margin of error/ 95% interval show with the data; additionally the link you provide does not show whether the data is weighted with the booming population size from the late 1800s to mid 1960s; the number of deaths might have been the same, and in the same geographic regions, that image cannot be used to make a statement without proper citations etc. (If you can provide the full articles for those images i&#39;d be happy to review them and edit my-comment if i&#39;m incorrect). Also, saying that the decrease in deaths cannot be attributed to vaccines is presumptuous, you have no data to support your argument; yes, there is a decrease in incidence of some of those diseases prior to the introduction of vaccines, but does that mean vaccines did not further reduce mortality? 
2. If i&#39;m not mistaken the reason why vaccines are rarely tested with a double-blind placebo method is due to health regulations/law, which makes extremely inconvenient for clinics to actually use human as samples. Also, you&#39;re assuming that macaques have the same immune system as humans and the study you cited is non-biased, which is incorrect. Some very quick biases i found when reading the article: 1st- individuals were subjected to ALL vaccines within a very short period of time, how in the world do you  know whether the combination of vaccines is what causes the any of the side-effects (none of their analyses tested for this btw); 2nd- if you just look at figure 3, you can tell their analysis is actually not significant and the way it is reported is misleading; 3rd- they tested normality exclusively with a plot? Why not use a Shapiro-Wilks test for normality in combination with an analysis of the plot? 4th- The authors used a Bonferonni correction for multiple comparisons but do not report either the original or the corrected p-values (one of the two is missing), no real way of knowing whether their correction method was ideal. There&#39;s a few other problems with the article but these are some of the most obvious biases within the methods/ experimental setups.
3. The meta-study is a joke; Yes it has a large sample size, but that is all there is to it. The authors pretty much state &quot;we know how sampling is good&quot; without giving and information of the protocol used. With that huge of a sample size you can also safely assume that individuals are from multiple geographic regions and live under different social and environmental conditions; good luck correcting for that.
4. Wikipedia is not a primary source of information, even for meta-studies, although i do agree that some study should be done on VAERS reports.
5.This is actually a good point, it is commonly known that some doctors administer more then the necessary. It is also however true that preemptive protection against some of the major diseases currently going around is very important.
6. Aye, defective/contaminated vaccines could be a problem, but that is not the average vaccine, now is it? The law was done to prevent people from suing for unreasonable &quot;side-effects&quot;; if everyone that has a minor side-effect from vaccination could sue, you&#39;d expect no one to make any more vaccines...
7. I don&#39;t really want ignorant and uneducated people to have a vote on whether a vaccine is not functioning correctly. I think the rest of the points are fine. 
8. U.S problems. 
9. Vaccines are an effective way of dealing with a majority of diseases (flu,  polio, etc); the leicester method isn&#39;t acceptable in this current century, since it allows for non-humane development of the diseases (such as paralysis for polio). The Leicester method has only been used in combination with vaccination on smallpox, it has never been found to be effective by itself. The Leicester method is also not very applicable at the national level nowdays, it could be an effective way at the organismal level (in combination with proper treatment) to avoid the spread of the disease, but &quot;quarantining&quot; a nation sounds unlikely to occur. 
10. If i&#39;m not correct the sue is due to breach of confidence, it has nothing to do with the effectiveness of vaccines. 
If you have any other sources, i wouldn&#39;t mind reviewing them. You may also want to consider using primary sources for your analyses rather then secondary sources. 
Cheers</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>According to official data, in the United States mortality rates from communicable diseases trended to practically zero before the introduction of vaccines.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How many deaths per capita per year from Polio before the introduction of the vaccine?</p>

<p>How did that change in the decade following the introduction of the vaccine?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll answer since you won&#39;t because it doesn&#39;t support the lie of yours that I quoted.</p>

<p>The Polio vaccine was introduced to the USA in 1955. ([Source]<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polio_vaccine">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polio_vaccine</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the United States, the 1952 polio epidemic became the worst outbreak in the nation’s history. Of nearly 58,000 cases reported that year 3,145 died and 21,269 were left with mild to disabling paralysis.</p>

<p>There were 157.6 million people in the USA in 1952, so the 24,414 deaths or paralyzations from the disease meant the rate of lasting or permanent harm was 15.49 per 100,000 people. The infection rate - 58,000 - meant that 36.8 people in 100,000 contracted the disease.</p>

<p>That mortality rate is definitely <strong>not</strong> trending toward zero right before the introduction of the vaccine.</p>

<p>In 1962, there were 910 cases of Polio reported. The population of the USA had risen to 186.5 million by that point. So the infection rate was 0.49 people in 100,000.</p>

<p>That infection rate is definitely trending toward zero <strong>after</strong> the introduction of the vaccine.</p>

<p>The last case of Polio reported in the USA was in 1979... (<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/polio/dis-faqs.htm">Source</a>)</p>

<p>... which clearly indicates that the vaccine is effective ...</p>

<p>But then you still have unvaccinated kids, so the disease isn&#39;t actually gone.

<p>My analysis was focused on the mortality rate as that seems much more important than incidence rate, and the data I shared was for far more than just one communicable disease. Can you link to any sources about the mortality rate of polio?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know what, let&#39;s go worst case. I linked a source that shows only 910 people were infected with the disease in 1962. More than that number could not have died from the disease. So let&#39;s pretend <strong>all of them died</strong> for an absolute worst case scenario.</p>

<p>The 1952 mortality rate - deaths only per capita - from Polio was 21,269 over a population of 157,600,000. That means the disease killed 13.5 people for every 100,000 in the nation.</p>

<p>Imagining that the 1962 contraction rate was equal to the death rate, that means that the mortality rate was 910 across a population of 186,500,000. The disease &quot;killed&quot; 0.49 people for every 100,000 in the nation.</p>

<p>13.5 is significantly greater than 0.49, yes?</p>

<p>If you listen to the actual interview (at around 2:15 in), you’ll see that it’s very clear that Hilleman, obviously aware of the conspiracy theories claiming that the AIDS virus derived from the virus used to make the early polio vaccine, was making a joke and that the people in the room during the interview realized it was a joke. That’s why they laughed. They were laughing at the conspiracy theorists. Those claims were clearly floating around in the mid-1980s, right at the height of the AIDS epidemic, before there was much in the way of effective treatment.

<p>I am going to say this is misleading, as it was not the last reported case, as your source states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The last cases of <strong>naturally occurring paralytic polio</strong>* in the United States were in 1979, when an outbreak occurred among the Amish in several Midwestern states. From 1980 through 1999, there were 162 confirmed cases of paralytic polio cases reported. Of the 162 cases, eight cases were acquired outside the United States and imported. The last imported case caused by wild poliovirus into the United States was reported in 1993. <strong>The remaining 154 cases were vaccine-associated paralytic polio (VAPP) caused by live oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV)</strong>*.&quot;</p>

<p>*<em>emphasis added</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And <a href="http://www.mothering.com/forum/47-vaccinations/1358433-unvaccinated-4-year-old-titer-results.html">Here is a forum discussion about a 4 year old that could be showing signs of naturally passed immunity</a>. Titer tests evaluate your antibodies response to different viruses, something that should normally be done before giving any vaccines, as there&#39;s no point of taking a polio vaccine if you&#39;re naturally immune.</p>

<p>Vaccines are a great idea, but poorly executed. I think we would both agree that the pharm companies could try harder to develop vaccines with less junk in them.</p>

<p>Our vaccination schedule could be moved back a few months rather than practically at birth, and our healthcare professionals should be recommending titer tests before carpet-bombing our immune systems.</p>

<p>I think that sounds reasonable.</p>

<p>This is why I said it&#39;s good that the parents get to apologize for their kids getting sick, instead of apologizing for them dying. It was whooping cough, not something considerably more deadly. Lucky them.</p>

<p>Then again, in first world nations, one would think that the vast majority of children are vaccinated against whooping cough. Seems like you could be implying that... since nobody&#39;s dying... the vaccines work? =)</p>

<p>I also don&#39;t want you to have to stand over you daughter&#39;s hospital bed explaining to her why she&#39;s going to die, and that explanation includes that you blindly followed anyone else&#39;s lead - not doing the research for yourself and understanding it for yourself.</p>

<p>This would necessarily include a population that is mostly vaccinated. What you really need is to compare infection (which are more telling than mortality) rates between areas that are and are not mostly vaccinated.</p>

<p>Incidence rates are not nearly as telling as mortality rates, because there are many problems with reporting and it is very easy to use statistics to hide the truth. On the other hand, deaths are much easier to track and provide a much clearer picture.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Incidence rates are not nearly as telling as mortality rates</p>

<p>Your logic is flawed.</p>

<p>Mortality rates are necessarily different depending on location, specifically the level of medical advancement in a specific area, so they&#39;re a poor measure of a vaccine&#39;s effectiveness.</p>

<p>Disease X, if you&#39;re a poor person who contracts it in Cambodia, probably has a much higher mortality rate than if you are a hedge fund manager who contracts it in New York City.</p>

<p>Vaccines are primarily about reducing the likelihood of contracting the disease, which incidence rate measures.</p>
