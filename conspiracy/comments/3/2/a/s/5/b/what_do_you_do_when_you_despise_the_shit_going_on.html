But so many just don&#39;t &quot;get it&quot;. We live in a bubble, and I feel like an alien. I despise this shit. I do not consent to what we are doing. I hate it, and feel sick. I know (being young, not too young though, in 20&#39;s) we never truly knew what the founders imagined. People talk about going back to the &quot;good ole days&quot;. Well when were they? Our history is based on falsehoods and lies. We know history based on the FED, the vampires of this nation. I know this goes way beyond that. I have some questions. What do you all think of George Washington? I know he was a Free Mason, but what are your thoughts? You think this nation was &quot;planned for a bigger picture/chess game&quot; or did the founders really want something &quot;else&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>George Washington was a Mason, but back then the Masons were actually a very respected group.  The Masons started as, basically, the first work union of stone masons and carpenters.  It became so respected (based on their demand for craftsmanship) that it slowly became a fraternal group of businessmen that used their respect for honesty and quality to promote their personal agendas.  This, in turn, allowed corruption to infest, which is the reason why the Masons are hardly mentioned today.  </p>

<p>This country didn&#39;t really go to shit until the Federal Reserve was set in 1913.  We can thank Woodrow Wilson for that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To appreciate the Masons, you need to understand what they originally stood for.</p>

<p>Back in the day, houses and buildings collapsed all the time.  This typically caused many deaths.  The Masons built buildings that lasted.</p>

<p>They were able to do this, because they not only insisted each member knew how to build, but they refused to cut corners.  Back in the day, if you hired a Mason to build you something, and you told him to cut back on safety, he would tell you to go to Hell, because that building would have the Mason stamp, and therefor would be a scar upon all Masons.</p>

<p>The Masons became known with honesty and quality.  I you wanted a house built for for family back then, you wanted a Mason house.</p>

<p>They were aware of corruption, and tried to prevent it, but it eventually came.  The Shriners (those old guys that drive the small cars in the parades) are a group that pulled from the Masons to escape the corruption.</p>

Do you feel more at home when dreaming?

    <div class="md"><p>A great word I like to use when describing this (for me, perpetual) state is interloper - feeling as though you are an alien even in a familiar environment, seeing everyday things without comprehending any of it. Not to say that I&#39;m unable to function in society, but feeling like an interloper makes it difficult to relate to others. I do not feel that I was meant to live on this planet sometimes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Teachers all over are talking about how there are kids now they have never known before.  Kids that question.  Kids that intimidate them.</p>

<p>These kids also tend to get along very well with animals.  They have great abilities with empathy and the arts (writing. poetry, music, acting, drawing, etc.), but care little for money.</p>

<p>Passionate in their actions, they fight for not only themselves, but for the expressive freedom of others.</p>

<p>These are the Indigo.  The children of the future.  The sculptors of the new world.</p>

<p>Where are they from?  This is a good question.  We Indigo are typically disgusted with society, so it&#39;s hard to believe we are a product of such.  We hate to lie, which seems to be something these parasites do happily.</p>

<p>All I know is we just started showing up here, and I want you to know that you are NOT alone.  We are here with you, and we will make this place better.</p>

<p>I wonder what type of commonalities &quot;we&quot; share. </p>

<p>Also, can someone verify the comment re: Shriners?</p>

<p>My late father, was a 33rd at age 26. This, is well...something just doesn&#39;t sit well with me...also, he soon after became a shriner, and was really active. </p>

<p>For the record, he was a very skilled man, Mason, heavy equipment operator, mechanic, crane operator....and generally a straight badass. </p>

<p>Just can&#39;t see him subscribing to any type of belief of anyone else&#39;s he didn&#39;t subscribe to. </p>

<p>I do know when we relocated a decade later, he refused to continue in a neighboring state with any affiliate. </p>

<p>Fuck all if &quot;they&quot; didn&#39;t do a land grab and fuck us out of our families estate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>George Washington poor?</p>

<p>Did some digging and found this:</p>

<p>&quot;George Washington&#39;s family was never poor --- they came to this country as land owning minor aristocracy --- considered Landed Gentry. </p>

<p>George&#39;s father Augustine Washington was a slave-owning tobacco planter. 
The Washingtons were moderately prosperous members of the Virginia gentry, of &quot;middling rank&quot; , though not one of the &quot;leading&quot; families. 
They were wealthy people who actually worked --- gentlemen farmers, plantation owners, and business men. 
George&#39;s half-brother Lawrence married into the family of William Fairfax --- 1st cousin of English aristocrat of Thomas, Lord Fairfax and Virginia&#39;s largest landowner. 
George&#39;s father also inherited a great deal of land from other relatives --- making them quite land wealthy and politically influential in Virginia. </p>

<p>Grandfather - Lawrence Washington, a military captain, planter, and a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses 
Great Grandfather - John Washington , an English Virginia planter, slave owner, and politician selected for the Virginia House of Burgesses. 
Great, Great Grandfather - Reverend Lawrence Washington, was a Fellow of Brasenose College, Oxford and an English Anglican Rector ( a college professor at Oxford University and academic, religious, political administrator for the Church of England)&quot;</p>

<p>Generally good info. Most Freemasonry is founding father&#39;s/enlightenment type ideology of equality and freedom. Grand Orient Lodge Freemasonry (also known as the Illuminati) was involved in the French and American Revolutions. RAW attributes to them the removal of monarchy from continental Europe.</p>

<p>Not to say Masons are never involved in shady shit. When dealing with shade, take note of the origin of your light source. </p>

<p>I love the idea of what we &quot;had&quot;. The idea, the people. So many great people in the US. But so many just don&#39;t &quot;get it&quot;. We live in a bubble, and I feel like an alien. I despise this shit. I do not consent to what we are doing. I hate it, and feel sick. </p>

<p>Take solace in the fact that there are <em>far more that feel that way</em>, but either don&#39;t know they see it or are too afraid to say/do anything about it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I know (being young, not too young though, in 20&#39;s) we never truly knew what the founders imagined. People talk about going back to the &quot;good ole days&quot;. Well when were they? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Founders were rich bankers, landowners, slave-owners, merchants, lawyers (basically the 1% of their day) who were charged with <em>amending the Articles Of Confederation, not abolish it entirely</em>. The roots of the birth of this nation were created to lead us down the path we are at right now. And your first step, really, as an American (IMHO of course) is acknowledging and understanding this.</p>

<p>Our history is based on falsehoods and lies. We know history based on the FED, the vampires of this nation. I know this goes way beyond that. I have some questions. What do you all think of George Washington? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Georgie was one of the richest people in the country - given his position in the Virginia Land company. Worth some research.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I know he was a Free Mason, but what are your thoughts? You think this nation was &quot;planned for a bigger picture/chess game&quot; or did the founders really want something &quot;else&quot;?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re seeing what they thought <em>it could become</em> 200+ years later.</p>

<p>My, what a creation they put together. It is literally <em>awesome</em>.</p>

<p>You&#39;re welcome, buddy. That&#39;s what I&#39;m here for lately, I guess.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reality is stranger than fiction. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reality <em>is fiction</em>. Remember - the victors write the history. Ever heard of HarperCollins? One of the biggest text book companies? Guess who owns them? <a href="http://www.fictionmatters.com/2010/03/05/who-are-%E2%80%9Cthe-big-six%E2%80%9D/">Sorry</a>, man, but this country lost an information war before you and I even drew a breath (I&#39;m in my early 30s, FWIW). We can blame the Boomers all we want, but that isn&#39;t constructive. Sure, they allowed this mess to be made, but it&#39;s our job to pick up the pieces.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What was the true intentions of the founders? I know all of what you said, <strong>but they also were fighting against the hierarchy of the king and church</strong>. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What makes you think so, given the link above? What do you <em>know</em> about the structure and founding of the country that <em>wasn&#39;t taught in your compulsatory education</em>?</p>

<p>Who signed the Treaty of Paris in 1783? What was going on in this country since Cornwallis&#39; surrender in 1781? Why did it take two years? And <em>what was in that treaty</em>?</p>

<p>In sum - you were fed a Founding Father&#39;s fable when you were a child about cherry trees and other mythos. Fuck, man, <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Apotheosis_of_Washington">this exists</a>. Think about it.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I hope I delivered, somewhat, and you&#39;ve got something to chew on.</p>

<p>When you think about it - you can&#39;t really talk about Sandy Hook/Boston Marathon/9.11 in real life at this point, but challenging the Founding Father mythos? You&#39;d be surprised how many people are open to at least entertaining <em>that thought</em> after a few beers. </p>

<p>And lately I&#39;m all about finding chinks in people&#39;s armor and exposing them to oneself, so that through self reflection and exploration, they will ultimately end up where we are right now.</p>

<p>Ever heard that saying</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can lead a horse to water, but you can&#39;t make them drink</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, you can&#39;t even lead these horses to water anymore, because they don&#39;t know they are thirsty. And it&#39;s time somebody reminded everyone how thirsty we really are.</p>

<p>Long days &amp; pleasant nights,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure! I&#39;m not trying to be ignorant btw, I did wiki the Treaty of Paris, but was still confused by what you meant. I really need to brush up on my American History. So the treaty was signed by King George III, ending the Revolutionary War, basically securing the colonies independence from British monarchy. Cornwallis surrendered at Yorktown, which was the last major battle, yet the war still didn&#39;t end for 2 more years when the treaty was signed. Not sure about what took place those two years, thats where I&#39;m still a little lost! I appreciate your response, I&#39;m very curious!</p>

<p>What you <em>think</em> you know about history is based on what the ruling elite have told you all your life. You think that the white race is responsible for all the world&#39;s problems? Then you don&#39;t realize that you have been brainwashed.</p>

<p>As I&#39;ve said many times, the two most important factors in your life and my life and everyone&#39;s life are religion and race. America was designed to be run by white Christian men. As long as it was run by white Christian men, it did just fine for itself and its population. Now that more and more non-white, non-Christian, non-males are assuming positions of power and authority, the system based on the rule of white Christian men is breaking down. It can&#39;t handle the corruption of the Jews, the incompetence of blacks, the silliness and Utopian dreaming of women.</p>

<p>I can put it simply. As white Christians go, so goes America. And as America goes, so goes Western civilization. We are in a death spiral and there is no sign that those intent on destroying America are going to relax their relentless campaign of racial extermination.</p>
