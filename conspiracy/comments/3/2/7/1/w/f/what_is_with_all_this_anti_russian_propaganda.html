<p>I can tell you first hand, the people of Russia and the government/ruling class people are very different, just as they are here in the US. </p>

<p>The whole city was incredibly warm and welcoming. We were required to stay in uniform for the visit and families stopped us to get pictures with us with their children. We encountered a number of people that were current or previous Russian Navy, and they were quick to shake our hands and have a drink with us. ( which we were not supposed to partake in) They take pride in their country and were proud to show us their country. Their city&#39;s &quot;birthday&quot; was around the Fourth of July so they had fireworks (don&#39;t recall if exactly the 4th or not) for our fourth celebration as well. </p>

<p>Just as you cannot judge Americans by the actions of our government, you should be hesitant to judge Russians by theirs . </p>

    <div class="md"><p>no actually, that&#39;s how you&#39;ve been taught humans interact by western media.</p>

<p>there was actually a great post about this the other day where a guy was filming people at a store in the 80s, at 2am drunk. all it was, was a video of their interactions with one another.</p>

<p>honestly it was beautiful, compared to the dolts and cell phone zombies running around bumping into each other today.</p>

<p>edit: i tried to find the link and could not if anyone has it please post id gladly watch people interacting normally again cause 2015 is fucked</p>

<p>people conflict over objectives because they have been intentionally divided.</p>

<p>GO YANKEES</p>

<p>no! GO METS!</p>

<p>If the US is the one committing war crimes.... and Russia has not had an expeditionary army since the war in Afghanistan.</p>

<p>Why is the dude&#39;s name practically Vladmir 666 Satan Hitler Bush Putin?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, so one thing I&#39;ve learned is to follow the money. If you view US aggression in terms of what they want globally (resources like natural gas and oil for their corporations to profit from), then you will be able to dig up this information.</p>

<p>The &quot;fight&quot; with Russia right now has to do with Syria and a gas pipeline that the US wants to go through there from Qatar. This is very bad for Russia, because they have a pipeline that feeds much of Europe already. So Russia has been backing Assad, while the US has been backing the rebels. Ukraine is also an example of this proxy war playing out.</p>

<p>The media lapdogs follow suit and then start a hate campaign against Russia.</p>

And in Africa where China is making investments rather than backing dictators and oppressive regimes to make economic gains.</p>

<p>African Country: &quot;Hmm, who should we do business with? The country that steals our resources at gun point and murders us, or the country that offers us reasonable and mutually beneficial terms for investment? That&#39;s a really tough call...&quot;  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not a secret any more than Hollywood is in bed with the Pentagon. Be it: through casual relationships between important personalities from both establishments, simple mutual business interests, cocaine, favoritism when it comes to things like the Pentagon freely giving/leasing military equip. to only &quot;friendly&quot; scripts or directors, etc...</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t take a fucking genius to figure it out -- just look at the casual and subliminal implication in the last few Michael Bay movies for example: Arabs are savages, Russians are evil, military is good/superior/cool, etc. </p>

<p>Shit is tired and obvious to anyone with any sort of historical/political knowledge of the world, that is, if they didn&#39;t already build their whole world view based on Hollywood flicks (Which is what the majority of Americans do, and that is the scary part).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Italian mafia predates any organized crime in Russia, let alone Russian mafia intervention in the US. The Italian&#39;s are more organized and secure than the Russians. The Italians have the Catholic church and Vatican on their side. Research it. Organized crime, no matter the ethnicity is bad, but Italian mafia has more pull than the Russians. Not saying we should scapegoat them, but it seems there is an active anti Russian propaganda plot unfolding.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>America, you don&#39;t really want to go to war. </p>

<p>America, it&#39;s them bad Russians. </p>

<p>Them Russians them Russians and them Chinamen. And them Russians. </p>

<p>The Russia wants to eat us alive. </p>

<p>The Russia&#39;s power mad. She wants to take our cars from out our garages. </p>

<p>Her wants to grab Chicago. Her needs a Red Reader&#39;s Digest. Her wants our auto plants in Siberia. Him big bureaucracy running our filling stations. </p>

<p>That no good.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Russia is the competing superpower also built on slave labor and  perpetuated tyranny by the elites standing on the backs of the impoverished and powerless. Propaganda from both sides will never cease to brainwash the masses and keep the old rivalry ablaze.</p>

<p>Anti-communism will make a real come back when the anti-terrorism agenda wears out.</p>
