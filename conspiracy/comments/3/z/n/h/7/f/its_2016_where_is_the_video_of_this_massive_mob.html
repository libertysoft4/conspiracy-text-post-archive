<p>supposed to be a french victim, but surprise surprise 5eyes/NATO australian victim in reality.</p>

<p>ditto the australian duping girl shot in the buttocks with her duping MSM interviewer/handler. oh the smiles and the giggles over a maiming gunshot wound.</p>

<p>and its all so fcuking obvious if you pat attention to the details or the gaping holes in the stories.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If there was a mass of people, you would only see a wall heads and shouldfer. Whats happening to a women being passed from person to person in a mass of people, like groping or robbing, is happening under walls of heads and shoulders. It would be difficult to tell if a person is groping from a person who is not doing anything. Thus, a perfect place for people to commit this kind of crime.</p>
