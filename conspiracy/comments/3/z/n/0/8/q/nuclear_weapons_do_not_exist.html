    <div class="md"><p>Halton Arp gave a different explanation of what &#39;Red Shift&#39; and &#39;Blue shift&#39; indicate , and it is nothing to do with cosmological distance. NASA is constantly releasing information that defies the mythical &#39;Top speed&#39; of the universe being Lightspeed. if in fact lightspeed is only the measurement of light itself in a vacuum then all of Einsteins equations are wrong, as suspected. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, Hubble himself never agreed that &quot;red shift&quot; indicated expansion. He said it was a &quot;hitherto unknown property of light&quot;.</p>

<p>His best guess was that light lost energy over cosmological distances, causing the red shift.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know how many papers were published. Tesla was a bit of an eccentric. Most of his research was peer reviewed though. He was constantly working with scientists who would verify his results.</p>

<p>He did constantly publish his findings for others to verify though.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nikola_Tesla_writings#Works">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nikola_Tesla_writings#Works</a></p>

<p>So, yeah. Even Tesla was subject to peer review and publishing.</p>

<p>I&#39;d suggest reading a few of his available works. For instance,  &quot;Experiments With Alternate Currents Of High Potential And High Frequency&quot; is available on Kindle and is worth the read.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup. I think the electric universe is the reality we live in. But even those working on the fringes of this subject are working with others in order to corroborate their findings. The only was they will be able to convince &quot;mainstream&quot;  science is through &quot;peer&quot; review. That&#39;s why these guys are publishing videos of their experiments and discussing results in forums.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. I believe the best course to investigate this theory would not involve pictures or film. It would be understanding the process. </p>

<p>But at the same time researching if photography or video making would even be possible within viewing distance of the extreme ionization, light, radiation, and EMP. These things reach way farther than the visible explosion.</p>

<p>What if it is an occurrence that can only be viewed live and what we have seen are just artists representations. </p>

<p>If you had any clue what you were talking about, you&#39;d know the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima was an air burst that detonated 1,900 feet above the surface. It would not leave a crater. That was one of the reasons there was so little fallout.</p>

<p>Did you not know that air burns? Did you not know that when you burn all the air in one location, is creates a vacuum that sucks the surrounding air and dust into itself?</p>

<p>There was no crater because the explosion happened at nearly 2000 feet above the surface, but the giant hole in the atmosphere created by that explosion soon collapsed and acted like a giant vacuum cleaner, sucking dust and smoke and water vapour into itself.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what you see burning and creating a column as the now superheated air and dust rises.</p>

<p>Not instantly, nor free. Fuel was &quot;burned&quot; at an extremely high rate to release that energy.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Nope, because you see it&#39;s <em>not</em> as easy as you make out. It takes incredibly precise machining of incredibly unstable materials to make the core of even the most simple nuclear bomb.</p>

<p>If there is even a slight mistake you get an incomplete chain reaction - essentially a dud.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Not really. You just have to achieve critical mass in a precise way for the energy contained in the fuel to spontaneously release itself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Did the bomb carry batteries?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope, it contained highly radioactive elements in precise quantities and machined to incredibly small tolerances. They only reason it didn&#39;t explode the instant it was made is because the fuel was kept below critical mass until the bomb detonated.</p>

<p>The detonation of the bomb forced the fuel to achieve critical mass in a precise way, which resulted in an uncontrolled chain reaction and a very big boom.</p>
