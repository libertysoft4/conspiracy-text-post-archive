    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the thing though, it really doesn&#39;t stop them any more than it did before.  I live in FL, a state that supposedly plays the gun show rules fast and loose because they do not have any laws requiring that gun show booths run one, but every single major gun show circuit requires it&#39;s dealers to run backgrounds with every weapon purchase and will actively have &#39;mystery shoppers&#39; go around and try to purchase weapons and convince the booth owners to sell without the background.</p>

<p>Nearly every single gun show does not want people to purchase without one because it opens them up to liability.  Those who are shot/ have loved ones shot and killed with one obtained without a background check can sue both the gun show operators and the dealer who allowed the gun to be purchased for negligence and even wrongful death.  It is in their best interest to run them regardless of laws enforcing it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See, that makes good sense. Leave the onus on the gun sellers. </p>

<p>Which is exactly what the executive order stated. Its not a law, its a guideline. Which means that as a dealer you COULD sell to someone without doing the check but it opens you up to a lawsuit later. </p>
