So what if the flat earth conspiracy is a government psyop to associate conspiracy theorist with flat earthers so that the masses think &quot;well there crazy enough to think the earth is flat why should we believe anything else the propose&quot;. it&#39;s really been getting to me lately that so many people believe the flat earth nonsense. I mean I&#39;m a very open minded conspiracy theorist and the flat earth thing just can&#39;t sell me. When ever I watch a &quot;flat earth&quot; video or something It&#39;s just total garbage and not scientifically backed up. That&#39;s just my two cents. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do realize that unless you&#39;ve already decided to believe [insert your conspiracy theory here] it looks exactly like how you see flat earthers, right?</p>

<p>I mean, seriously, all the 9/11 truthing stuff or the Holocaust wasn&#39;t real stuff or global warming is fake stuff doesn&#39;t appear even slightly different to me from the average Flat Earth video.  Its all ignoring giant mountains of evidence in order to obsess over tiny little microscopic &quot;flaws&quot; that, on examination by someone who actually knows what they&#39;re talking about, aren&#39;t even flaws to begin with.</p>

<p>And the conspiracy explanation for what is going on is based, basically, on a hunch and wouldn&#39;t stand up to even a ten thousandth of the sort of tireless examination of microscopic flaws that you spend on debunking the actual explanation. </p>

<p>Trust me, no one needs flat earthers to make other conspiracy theorists look bad, to people on the outside you all look identical:  non-experts trying to bolster their egos by pretending they&#39;re so smart they can see through a vast shadowy conspiracy to a hidden truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>More than the fake news it represents, there is one outlier from normal conspiracies that the flat earth theory involves.</p>

<p>That is: who cares ? how is this information going ( if true ) to change our consciousness in matter of the political and the social ? no way.</p>

<p>It has no relevance to any of the topics usually debated here.
It doesn&#39;t change our perceptions of social reality.</p>

<p>If i posted a hundred topics about how mosquitos are really mammals, why should people care ? we aren&#39;t here for it. It doesn&#39;t change our world. It just wastes our time.</p>

<p>Even if it was all true, it would change NOTHING.
It has no impact on society or politics. No meaning, aside &quot;they lied to us!!&quot;, which, however, is true in a lot of very relevant topics.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why it&#39;s all shit.</p>

<p>Even if the earth was flat and the mosquitos were mammals, no real problem would then be closer to its solution.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all disinformation, or better said, <em>distraction</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Flat Earth groups are most likely a &quot;Discredit By Association&quot; attempt by space organizations to prevent individuals from questioning the greater questions remaining unanswered by modern science and space agency fronts.  </p>

<p>Furthermore, it seems to be a finely crafted psychological operation to prevent individuals from questioning NASA and other space agencies&#39; authenticity due to their universally fraudulent images and videos of outer space.    </p>

<p>It goes something like this:  Flat Earthers must make the claims I&#39;ve made above.  But then they go further with a quite easily dismissed theory (a few hours to days given someone has some scientific training.)  The outsider, who finally looks at the evidence and contradictions alongside staring up at the sky, while suppressing the propaganda deeply seeded in his or her psyche usually will run into Flat Earth.  Once Flat Earth is sufficiently dismissed in their mind, they then falsely believe NASA machinations gain credence somehow.  </p>

<p>But yes, the existence of Flat Earth and the general ridicule observed even in the political sphere (Many presidents have mentioned it) might cause many to never look more closely at the pictures and video of deep outer space with a critical eye for forgery</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because anyone capable of seeing the big picture can make the determination all on their own.  I can see that other planets are indeed round.  Basic physics apply here, which is what is being ignored with the claim of flat, concave or hollow Earth theories.  Micro-gravity experiments can prove that the Earth and all planets and stars you see are indeed globes.  Smaller bodies can have irregular shapes, but they are certainly not flat.  Common sense and logic are required, something obviously not used with these &quot;theories&quot;.  In fact, &quot;Flat Earth&quot; isn&#39;t even a theory.  It has already been proven false, so in fact it is not even a hypothesis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What does religion have to do with Christians?</p>

<p>Christians are free to choose to follow what Jesus said or not. If they choose to place the power in the priest, it was up to them to choose the priest. </p>

<p>If they chose a priest that manipulates the teachings of Jesus, then they are not choosing to be Christian, they are choosing to oppose Christianity. That they choose to keep the name of Christian and allow people like you to smear people who try to follow the teachings of Jesus is sad.</p>

<p>Perhaps, in the future, you can refrain from calling them Christian. </p>

<p>What abilities I lack should not affect that.</p>

<p>As soon as they stop calling themselves that, I will happily do so, too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you possess the ability, take a step back and imagine, as John Lennon so sagely wrote, a world with NO religion. Even Buddhism. Firmly plant yourself there. Make it real in your mind.</p>

<p>Now look back over your actions. Have you been guided by leaders - religious or otherwise - using your religion as a tool - to act in a manner that is not in the best interest of yourself or society?</p>

<p>As a Buddhist, I suspect the answer is probably, &quot;no&quot;. Buddhists tend to take a broader view. They tend to do what is best for society. For life. I have immense respect for His Holiness the Dalai Lama and all who follow his teachings faithfully.</p>

<p>Christians and Muslims, especially modern ones who follow the teachings and words and direction of preachers, not so much. The job of such preachers is to create artificial groupings and divide people accordingly, so they fight amongst themselves, remaining blind to the true problems in the world. Their followers are easily misguided due to their belief and blind faith in their leaders, religious and otherwise.</p>

<p>The Flat Earth bullshit is easily tested and found to be lies.  You deliberately post that bullshit, anyway.  Therefore you deliberately spread lies.  I suppose some might argue that you negligently spread lies, but actually negligence is a form of deliberation, so it&#39;s the same either way.</p>

<p>And, most importantly, it doesn&#39;t matter <em>why</em> you spread lies.  What matters is that you and your co-conspirators stop.</p>

<p>Of course I can.  I don&#39;t need to bother, but I can.  It&#39;s also not appropriate on this thread.  The topic of this thread correctly assumes there&#39;s nothing factual to argue about.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve watched the stupid flat earth YouTube videos, such as &quot;200 proofs.&quot;  They&#39;re all easily disproven lies.</p>

<p>The problem is that <em>you</em> haven&#39;t engaged in the burden of proof.  You don&#39;t know geometry, so you accept lies from people who are playing you for the fool you are.</p>
