        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>What is Zionism? Zionism is an ideological belief system based around the idea that Israel will retake Mount Zion in the center of Jerusalem, <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@31.7795506,35.1973976,13z">which is currently basically split in half between Palestine and Israel.</a> Zionism is the core ideology of the Israeli Government. Zionism is important because it is the belief system of many very powerful people and organizations, from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rothschild_family#Jewish_identity_and_positions_on_Zionism">Rothschilds</a> to Sheldon Adelson to Mark Zuckerberg.</p>

<p><strong>Hillary</strong></p>

<p>Hillary has been a long-time supporter of the idea that Jerusalem is Israel&#39;s. In 1999 she wrote in a letter <a href="http://jpupdates.com/2015/07/08/hillary-clinton-was-first-to-support-moving-u-s-embassy-to-jerusalem-but-does-she-support-it-now/">“If I am chosen by New Yorkers to be their senator, or in whatever position I find myself in the years to come, you can be sure that I will be an active, committed advocate for a strong and secure Israel, able to live in peace with its neighbors, with the United States Embassy located in its capital, Jerusalem.”</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Politics-And-Diplomacy/Saban-Hillary-is-ideal-candidate-for-Israel-403172">jpost and Zionist billionaire say &quot;Hillary is ideal candidate for Israel&quot;</a></p>

<p><strong>Trump</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-israel-idUSKBN0TS17V20151209">Furor in Israel as Trump to be hosted by Netanyahu after remarks on Muslims</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/donald-trump-big-israel-endorses-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahu-1017172">He has always been a big supporter of the Israeli government and what has happened recently there.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.wvwnews.net/content/index.php?/news_printer/alert_zionist_capo_sheldon_adelson_summons_trump_for_%E2%80%9Cprivate_meeting%E2%80%9D_on_israel.html">He and Aldeson met in Macau to discuss Zionism, an issue important to Adelson who also owns most media 
in Australia and several large media companies in the US and Europe.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-1.690568">Zionist Organization of America comes out to say Trump should now delcare for an &quot;undivided Jerusalem&quot; after his remarks</a></p>

<p><strong>Sanders</strong></p>

<p>In response to being asked if he is a Zionist by a Vox interviewer:</p>

<p>“A Zionist? What does that mean? Want to define what the word is? Do I think Israel has the right to exist? Yeah, I do. Do I believe that the United States should be playing an even-handed role in terms of its dealings with the Palestinian community in Israel? Absolutely I do.“</p>

<p><a href="http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Where-does-Bernie-Sanders-the-Jewish-candidate-for-president-stand-on-Israel-412448">&quot;Again, I think that you have volatile regions in the world, the Middle East is one of them, and the United States has got to work with other countries around the world to fight for Israel’s security and existence at the same time as we fight for a Palestinian state where the people in that country can enjoy a decent standard of living, which is certainly not the case right now. My long-term hope is that instead of pouring so much military aid into Israel, into Egypt, we can provide more economic aid to help improve the standard of living of the people in that area.”</a></p>

<p><strong>Jeb</strong></p>

<p>Just like Hillary, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/30/politics/jeb-bush-u-s-embassy-location-israel/">Jeb wants to move the US Embassy to Jerusalem</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-1.655896">Zionists want another term of the last Bush, but they&#39;ll settle for Jeb, who would&#39;ve also authorized the Iraq invasion.</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>So all the candidates do things for Israel and more importantly the Zionist billionaires who are pulling the strings of many governments. If they do not toe the line, they are systematically excluded from the media, like Ron Paul was. The more they oppose Zionist ideas, the more actively they&#39;re cut out of the media landscape, and the more they promote them the more they&#39;re placed in the center of attention. </p>

<p>Check out this video, giving good examples of even more candidates like Ted Cruz and Rand Paul with video clips of statements showing their support of Zionist ideals because they need the financial and media support from Zionists in order to succeed in our governmental system as it exists. <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x31tczh">http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x31tczh</a></p>

If you dont give your support, the various parties will not fund your campaigns. If true, which it probably is, its important that everyone understands this. Its the reason why they are all in support of Israel, its because they are being forced into it in order to stay in office. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The biggest lobbying firm in the US spent $29 million in 2015. AIPAC spent $2.5 million.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The power of AIPAC is not in the paltry $2.5 million they declare to have spent on <em>direct lobbying</em>. As all (successful) politicians know, AIPAC&#39;s power is in the influence that they wield over their private members - countless immensly wealthy individuals and the corporations they control - and the PRIVATE funds that will be directed to candidates as per the direction of AIPAC.</p>

<p>They&#39;re not stupid. They know <em>very well</em> how to play the political game - and as the results show, <em>they are VERY good at it</em>.</p>

<p>The reason that they are so successful is that they and their members are part of a group that has well-defined objectives, and they work in close cooperation and coordination with one another, combining their efforts to achieving those objectives. </p>

<p>General Public vs Zionist = Lighthouse vs Laser. The former is MUCH more powerful, but that power is dispersed and diffused, whereas the latter is weaker in overall wattage, but is extremely concentrated and focused.</p>

<p>Which one makes the politicians <strong>FEEL THE BURN?</strong></p>

<p>So, one might ponder, what would happen if one were to utilize the wattage of the Lighthouse, and focus it in a manner that emulates that of the Laser?</p>

<p>Could the filthy politicians who are currently kowtowing to Zionist interests fail to take notice?</p>

<p>Enlightening.</p>

<p>2010 is when <em>Citizens United</em> was decided, so it makes sense that lobbying would decrease as more money is spent covertly through super PACs.</p>

It&#39;s possible to overcome if enough people are browsing the new tab, so it can reach the main page and get votes, but sometimes that doesn&#39;t happen like in your post and it is effectively censored. </p>

<p>Also, notice how the vote counter is gone from the thread, and it only shows a percentage? That always happens in threads that get driven to zero like this. They don&#39;t want to show that there&#39;s dozens of downvotes I guess, that would make it too obvious. It must be written in to reddit code to remove the counter if the percentage is too low after too many votes or something, which shows how sold-out this site really is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your speaking the truth, no wonder if US gives so many green card so the US citizen will filled with peoples who doesn&#39;t care about the US it&#39;s self.
And this is the result of what&#39;s happen after that, 
they control us, they brainwash us, and they bring us into the dark ages. in fact they control everything, our government, our money, our freedom to speech
and now we must choose the candidate that they chosen for us. is this what we call democracy? the fact is democracy is belong to the Elite not for citizen who still fighting for their right to get a job, get a food and get a better life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Take the powerful Jewish lobby and intertwine it with christian white guilt and misunderstood aspects of their religions and how the differ and this is what you get. We endorsed our government aiding and allying with Israel because for one ww2 (the way it is historically remembered in the mainstream) and two the bible. People see Israel and immediately think God&#39;s Israel. However, the way I understand it, Israel was supposed to be rebuilt by God, but some scholars believed a holocaust of 6,000,000 jews could also cause it to be rebuilt, hence why that number is clung to although its technically wildly inaccurate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s crazy how true dissent has been replaced with this sort of faux-dissent that allows people to blindly go around calling more rational and educated people &#39;sheeple&#39; or &#39;programmed&#39; despite being the ones who are literally following and sharing shit from pages like &#39;anti media&#39; that only exists to make money through ad revenue and these peoples continued ignorance of reality.</p>

<p>Who cares about trade deals and ecological destruction when you can worry about easy shit like &#39;teslas free energy&#39; or &#39;triangles in beyonce videos&#39; and bullshit like this.... Works a treat for the elite having a bunch of hopelessly distracted religious level psuedo-activists.</p>

<p>I mean... You&#39;ve seen anonymous lately. The majority of their presence is on some link aggregating facebook page Anonymous (just like that anti media one and numerous others) where 40 year old men who just figured out how to use google don a guy fawkes mask and call themselves &#39;hacktivists&#39; while adding to the distraction and supporting the clickbait on this page owned by people who are just looking to exploit their ignorance to gain money through web traffic and ad revenue... While using the anon tag to claim the work of REAL activists and REAL &#39;hackers&#39;/ leakers such as snowden or whoever else.</p>

<p>These people say &#39;do your own research&#39;... Do your own research, but dont fucking ignore anything that disagrees with your predetermined ideas, because that would make you truly &#39;sheep-like&#39;!</p>

<p>The security services love idiot pages like this. They distract the public by the millions into forgetting WHAT they&#39;re tangibly supposed to be fighting against. These people are the perfect anti-protestor... The security services used to have to hire these people to be inserted into legit protests and act insanely in order to discredit movements... Now they just go online, create some shit and run off letting these fucknuts do all the work for FREE.</p>

<p>To all these people... For the sake of true dissent. Wake the fuck up.</p>

<p>Sorry if this &#39;conspiracy&#39; doesnt fit in with your predetermined ideas btw, just something you need to think about before any more societal harm is done by ignorance.</p>
