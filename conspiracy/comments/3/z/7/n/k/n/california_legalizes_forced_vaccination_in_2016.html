    <div class="md"><p>I wonder how well a <a href="http://www.commonwealths.org/documents/common-law-right-violations-fee-schedule">declaration / fee schedule</a> would work in this regard. If they attempt to force your child to get a vaccination, just submit a fee schedule for violation of rights, damage and loss of the child payable in advance of the vaccination. Make it a large enough sum that they wont go though with it and if they dont want to be held liable and submit it to any agent that attempts to force this on you. Statute Law being contract law. IF they are going to pass laws like this then do whatever it takes to hold the people involved accountable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From the link within <a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-g-california-new-laws-2016-htmlstory.html">your link</a>:</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/political/la-me-ln-governor-signs-tough-new-vaccination-law-20150630-story.html">California Gov. Jerry Brown signs new vaccination law, one of nation&#39;s toughest</a></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I think it’s a great day for California’s children. You’re living in a state that just got a little safer,” <strong>said Dr. Paul Offit</strong>, chief of the division of infectious diseases at Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia and an advocate of immunization.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, who the hell is Dr. Paul Offit?</p>

<p>Offit, AKA &quot;<strong><em>Offit for Profit</em></strong>&quot; is a &quot;vaccine advocate&quot; an admitted paid shill for the vaccine industry who shamelessly and soullessly pimps vaccines in exchange for filthy lucre.</p>

<p>Here is a <strong>CBS News article</strong> on this charlatan:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-independent-are-vaccine-defenders/"><strong>How Independent Are Vaccine Defenders?</strong></a></p>

<p><strong>FULL ARTICLE:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>They&#39;re some of the most trusted voices in the defense of vaccine safety: the American Academy of Pediatrics, Every Child By Two, and pediatrician <strong>Dr. Paul Offit</strong>.</p>

<p>But CBS News has found these three have something more in common - <strong>strong financial ties to the industry whose products they promote and defend</strong>.</p>

<p>The vaccine industry gives millions to the Academy of Pediatrics for conferences, grants, medical education classes and even helped build their headquarters. <strong>The totals are kept secret</strong>, but public documents reveal bits and pieces.</p>

<p>** A $342,000 payment from Wyeth**, maker of the pneumococcal vaccine - which makes $2 billion a year in sales.</p>

<p><strong>A $433,000 contribution from Merck</strong>, the same year the academy endorsed Merck&#39;s HPV vaccine - which made $1.5 billion a year in sales.</p>

<p>Another top donor: Sanofi Aventis, maker of 17 vaccines and a new five-in-one combo shot just added to the childhood vaccine schedule last month.</p>

<p><strong>Every Child By Two</strong>, a group that promotes early immunization for all children, <strong>admits the group takes money from the vaccine industry, too - but wouldn&#39;t tell us how much.</strong></p>

<p>A spokesman told CBS News: <strong>&quot;There are simply no conflicts to be unearthed.&quot; But guess who&#39;s listed as the group&#39;s treasurers? Officials from Wyeth and a paid advisor to big pharmaceutical clients</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Then there&#39;s Paul Offit</strong>, perhaps the most widely-quoted defender of vaccine safety.</p>

<p><strong>He&#39;s gone so far as to say babies can tolerate &quot;10,000 vaccines at once</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>This is how Offit described himself in a previous interview: <strong>&quot;I&#39;m the chief of infectious disease at Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia and a professor of pediatrics at Penn&#39;s medical school,&quot;</strong> he said.</p>

<p>Offit was not willing to be interviewed on this subject but like others in this CBS News investigation, <strong>he has strong industry ties. In fact, he&#39;s a vaccine industry insider</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Offit holds in a $1.5 million dollar research chair at Children&#39;s Hospital, funded by Merck. He holds the patent on an anti-diarrhea vaccine he developed with Merck, Rotateq, which has prevented thousands of hospitalizations</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>And future royalties for the vaccine were just sold for $182 million cash. Dr. Offit&#39;s share of vaccine profits? Unknown.</strong> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>[??? &gt; $$$ / PROFIT!!! :-) ]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s nothing illegal about the financial relationships, but to critics, they pose a serious risk for conflicts of interest. <strong>As one member of Congress put it, money from the pharmaceutical industry can shape the practices of those who hold themselves out to be &quot;independent.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>The American Academy of Pediatrics, Every Child By Two and Dr. Offit <strong>would not agree to interviews</strong>, but all told us <strong>they&#39;re up front about the money they receive, and it doesn&#39;t sway their opinions</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Today&#39;s immunization schedule now calls for kids to get 55 doses of vaccines by age 6.</strong></p>

<p>Ideally, it makes for a healthier society. <strong>But critics worry that industry ties could impact the advice given to the public about all those vaccines</strong>. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gee, YA THINK???</p>

<p>Modifying Offit&#39;s comment from above:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I think it’s a great day for <del>California’s children</del> <strong>THE VACCINE INDUSTRY</strong>. You’re living in a state that just <del>got a little safer</del> BECAME A LOT MORE PROFITABLE.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Offit: &quot;He&#39;s gone so far as to say babies can tolerate &quot;10,000 vaccines at once&quot;</p>

<p>Well, if that be the case, a BIG, STRONG GROWNUP MAN like Dr. Offit should be able to take a MILLION vaccines at once.</p>

<p><strong><em>PAGING DR. OFFIT - DR. PAUL OFFIT TO THE WHITE COURTESY PHONE. PLEASE!!!</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>Help wanted:</strong> 1,000,000 volunteers with 1,000,000 needles and 1,000,000 doses of vaccine (your choice - <strong>BYOV</strong>). It&#39;s for the good of humanity! Honest~!</p>

<p>/Overuse of <strong>bold</strong> and ALL CAPS</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Thanks for the gold!</p>

<p>This is what I think will happen. Somewhere in the world, like the phoenix will be reborn from the ashes. Another beacon of freedom, but reformatted (improved) from what we&#39;ve learned. I personally think the US is Rome and it&#39;s definitely at the top of the hill (burning) teetering, about to fall. The end days of Rome/Weimar Republic are uncanny to the US.</p>

<p>Fuck those people. The founding fathers were British &quot;traitors&quot;. Just like in their time, they knew they needed to establish a new country with freedom. I think this will ultimately happen. People will ex-pat and establish a new country based on founding principles. I see nothing wrong with that. Or, there could be a 2nd revolution in the US. Really not sure how that would all go down. Tis&#39; interesting times we live in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Much as I agree with not standing by as one&#39;s country goes to shit, going to another area is bad if that &quot;colonization&quot; involves killing and/or enslaving the people that might already be there before you.

<p>Seems it&#39;d be better to stay and fight to make things right.  The world&#39;s pretty crowded at this point and there aren&#39;t too many other places to go that don&#39;t already have their own population already there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That the logic of refusing vaccines because they aren&#39;t 100% safe isn&#39;t actually logical.</p>

<p>If we decided we should do things that were only 100% safe we wouldn&#39;t really do much of anything at all. It doesn&#39;t do anyone good to support the fear mongering tactics of anti vaxxers. I agree that some pro vaxxers do the same thing, but there is imperical evidence proving that vaccines have led to the near eradication of several diseases, many of which have now become prevalent again due to people refusing them, and this all started because someone published a false study, and has since lost his license to practice medicine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You lost me at the first sentence.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not logical to refuse something that you believe may hurt you?  I think if I set myself on fire I will get hurt isn&#39;t logical and smart?</p>

<p>There is fear mongering on both sides.  Some are valid some are not, but if we&#39;re going to have this conversation, lets talk about what isn&#39;t talked about.  The people that are a live but now disabled long term after getting a vaccination.  Showing this side of the impact isn&#39;t fear mongering its showing the possible risks.  I think this is reasonable and responsible to do.  I have asked these questions but no one will answer it.  </p>

<ul>
<li>Would you take a vaccine that you knew would disable you for life?  For the betterment of the whole?</li>
<li>Would you accept the loss of people, death or disable for the potential of saving a few thousand people a year?</li>
<li>At what number would the saving of life vs the death/disable people caused by vaccines would need to be met before you say its not worth it?</li>
</ul>

<p>I understand that some vaccines can help with the health of the population.  I understand that disease comes and goes over time not due to vaccines but general sanitation of the population.</p>

<p>Just remember that throughout history, the earth was the center of the universe, it was also flat and there had been witches and some of these people that questioned the narrative died over it.  Now we think that is silly.</p>

<p>I still haven&#39;t been shown vaccinations to be safe and we don&#39;t really have long term studies on I would assume most vaccinations in use today.  Like the politicians who pass bills to find out whats in them later on is exactly the same mentality here.  We just don&#39;t have good information to make a sound decision.  We have some information, which I assume is mostly accurate.  But some people are fine to risk other people to test the vaccinations.  We&#39;re likely causing some damage to the children and their children which we may yet to understand.</p>

<p>But we can agree that vaccinations are not safe and that there are people who&#39;re happy to kill/disable for the betterment of the whole or at least for those that can&#39;t get vaccinations.  It&#39;s ironic that these people in my conversations have never admitted to supporting collateral damage when other people are involved.</p>

<p>As of now there are 0 deaths from measles in 12 years in the US
As of now there are about 500 deaths from TB on average with 9000 or so cases reported each year, more than 1/2 being from foreign-born people and I suspect the others are in poor health anyway due to age and lifestyle choices.</p>

<p>We can cry that 500 is to many, I think there are much bigger problems to deal with that are killing a lot more people each year.</p>

<p>I&#39;m unsure why we&#39;re continuing..</p>

<p>What about whooping cough?  30 die since the vaccination was released, before it was 9000.  I didn&#39;t check if this is USA data but I will assume it is.</p>

<p>The fire statement has no relation to vaccines.  That statement went went over your head, so reread it again or move on because it doesn&#39;t&#39; matter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying you said its 100% safe I&#39;m asking for proof that they&#39;re.  I&#39;m asking for any person that support forced vaccinations to provide me a solid study or proof that shows each vaccination is safe for everyone its going to be forced upon.  This is never brought up in conversation because it doesn&#39;t exist.  There will always be people who will suffer in various ways but this is hardly ever brought up.</p>

<p>You&#39;re calling me an idiot because I don&#39;t agree with forced vaccinations.  I don&#39;t agree because I don&#39;t believe they&#39;re safe as in all vaccinations, I haven&#39;t seen that they&#39;re safe.  I have studied history about governments not being honest with the people of the world and today is no different.</p>

<p>I asked you a direct question, it was specific because its forcing you to give me an answer that publicly shows your true character.  Even if you&#39;re ok with killing or disabling that one person are you willing to do it yourself?  I don&#39;t think most people would, I doubt you would do the injection.</p>

<p>I think everyones life is important, but it&#39;s more important to me that each person has the ability to self determine their own life.  So I would allow nature to take its course and many will suffer, some will die.  But at least they had the choice.</p>

<p>Certainly not easy though.  Again, I wouldn&#39;t disagree with what you said.</p>

<p>This seems like a well-balanced perspective.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Well, the public water supplies have been fluoridated for quite some time now, and fluoride has been shown to retard many needed bodily and brain functions, so there&#39;s that...  :/</p>

Neither will the LA Times do a story on the adverse effects of vaccinations. <a href="http://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-0202-vaccination-rates-20160201-story.html">http://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-0202-vaccination-rates-20160201-story.html</a>
 The most affluent and well-informed parents in California are against this vaccination law. Many will leave the state or homeschool their children. California will be worse off when the best and the brightest are not in their schools.</p>
