        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Videos like this one often mention the missing 28 pages and that the identities of those behind the attacks were Saudis, not Israeli.  </p>

<p><a href="http://youtu.be/44vI3hzOsbg">http://youtu.be/44vI3hzOsbg</a></p>

<p>It seems to me that the damning information isn&#39;t so much the names of the individuals, but rather their country of origin.  Israel is never (?) mentioned in official documents or commentary by the PTB, as far as I know.  Is this because it is bad politics to ever mention Israel in a bad light for fear of being labelled as antisemitic?  Or is it because Israel had nothing to do with it? </p>

<p>I find it hard to believe that Israel would not have been involved.  Israel would have had the most to gain in the form of aligning the US&#39; interests with their own by further demonizing the Arabs and fueling their wars against them using the US to fight said wars with our American tax dollars.  In hindsight, if Israel was behind it, it was a genius move because exactly that happened and we Americans have paid for Israel&#39;s wars against the Arabs with our US tax dollars.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to see how Israel would have benefited from this.  It&#39;s not as clear to me how the Saudis would have benefited from the 911 attacks, other than schadenfreude, which is not nearly as valuable.  </p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To nogrim, there will be no bombs, change will come from within because as we&#39;ve all seen with our own eyes, it has to happen that way for it to not fail.</p>

<p>This is why they are threatening the house of Saudi and many of the people in Saudi do not believe the royal family are actually Arabs but rather Jews and Custodian to the position rather than actually appointed. This is proven with their very close work with families like the Bush&#39;s and how the Petro Dollar was first formed.</p>

<p>So what will happen is regime change but the US will not go to war. When such a thing does happen, what <a href="/u/flyyyyyyy">/u/flyyyyyyy</a> below has said will happen, Saudi will partner with Russia and Iran, making it so Israel is surrounded by enemies.</p>

In the end, Israel benefits the most from the &quot;war on terror&quot;, in regards to the Greater Israel plan. Just my opinion.</p>

Also, by patsies, I should&#39;ve said sacrifices.  I think the hijackers were &quot;trained&quot; (failures though) and thought they were going to do this. Now it could go two ways. The planes were remotely hijacked and controlled by that Isreali company (forget the name), and remotely controlled, or the planes were switched for drones of some sorts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Neither, it was probably a group of people within the Bush administration and the Pentagon.</p>

<p>The hijackers were well known to the CIA and the FBI, and they were allowed to wander around planning the hijacking without interference from law enforcement.</p>

<p>Donald Rumsfeld was derelict in his duty as the head of America&#39;s armed forces.</p>

<p>Mossad agents might have been the ones that rigged the twin towers for demolition, but it&#39;s highly unlikely that Mossad had access to building 7, which after all contained the CIA&#39;s largest facility outside of Langley.</p>

<p>Israel + Pentagon / CIA</p>

<p>Israel took the planning / execution lead.  </p>

<p>CIA/Pentagon managed the bulk of supportive logistics (i.e., &quot;enabling it to happen&quot;).</p>

<p>Cheney / Rumsfeld were the US leads, while Bush was in the loop as a simple, over-zealous Christian stooge.</p>

<p>Clearly, however, Israel knew about it ahead of time. Silverstein is, essentially, an Israeli asset, one in weekly contact with the Prime Minister of Israel at the time.</p>

<p>But Mossad could not have done it without the assistance of the Pentagon and the CIA.</p>

<p>Plus, I don&#39;t see how they could have had access to WTC7. It seems very implausible that CIA would have allowed outsiders that much access to their second most important facility.</p>

But the guy that is 100% convinced it was Israel cut and dry is flying high on the top. Look through my history, I don&#39;t care for Israel. About as much as I&#39;d care for America if I didn&#39;t live here and by birthright care what happens here. But Israel can&#39;t do a damn thing to us without us knowing what is going down.

    <div class="md"><p>Since the Israel lobby is so powerful, and Jewish power is a taboo subject in America, people tend to over-compensate the other direction sometimes.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no doubt that Israel knew the attacks were coming, and it seems very plausible to me that they had a hand in the attack - certainly Silverstein (essentially a Mossad asset) had foreknowledge.</p>

<p>But I just don&#39;t think that Israel could have pulled it off by themselves. The Bush administration had to have been involved.</p>
