I understand her corrupted super PACS financially support her but I have not talked to a single person who is pro-Hillary. We see tremendous support for Bernie Sander&#39;s all over the Internet, Americans giving small donations in massive numbers and huge crowds at events. Even the hard core republicans I talk to respect Bernie as a candidate even though they don&#39;t plan to vote for him. I don&#39;t want this to be a &quot;pro-Bernie&quot; circle jerk, but I&#39;m genuinely curious as to how Hillary is still dominating the polls when it doesn&#39;t seem like any normal American plans to vote for her. This is the first presidential election I&#39;ve been really involved in and it just doesn&#39;t make any sense. </p>

<p>Yes, wouldn&#39;t change a damn thing. We have a deep state. The NSA (Think KGB, Stasi) has dirt on all these dirty fucks. They will be blackmailed, black balled, and coerced into TPTB&#39;s bidding. If you shake the boat too much, look at JFK. Mind you, he came from the elite families of yesterdays.

    <div class="md"><p>While I agree and think it should be kept fairly brief, that doesn&#39;t mean things can&#39;t have more than one definition (a meta-take on <em>doublespeak</em>).</p>

<p>For example, TPTB could be described different ways depending on where someone is on the rabbit hole journey that inevitably starts in forums like this. It could be defined as jewish banking conspiracy, insert some Rothschild and Rockerfeller stuff, and you&#39;re not particularly wrong, but it is clouded with an edge of the whole jewish conspiracy stuff that floods this place (and places like it)</p>

<p>Or it could just be described as the <em>shadow government</em>, which multiple high level political elites have admitted to, who meet in secret, and use the Bilderburg and Bohemian Grove and Freemason stuff into it - and you wouldn&#39;t be half wrong, either.</p>

<p>Describing the same situation (our reality) multiple ways has been a very effective tool in training oneself to see things and consider things <em>may not be what they seem</em>, increasing awareness and hopefully, eventually, pushing things in an better direction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d assume it would be somewhat of a rational ban... No refugees, no Muslims from countries with extremist ties, etc. etc. mostly a temporary ban until we can vet those wanting to get in.

<p>Donald has run in the past and always drops out after a few weeks or months, why is he staying in so long this time?</p>

<p>I think they were going to bank on Hillary being a woman to get her the election but her history and the whole Benghazi/email thing is just too toxic for her to win straight up on her gender like Obama did on his ethnic background.</p>

<p>I think &#39;bug&#39;s cunt&#39; fully expresses the desired nuance of the insult in a way that &#39;cunt&#39; alone simply cannot. A bug is a non-descript, lowdown, dirty, diseased, disgusting creature and it follows that such vile abominations, deserving nothing more than the bootheel, must be birthed from some equally gross, and inconsequential, ichor-slimed hole. </p>

<p>Bug&#39;s cunt is the perfect term.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think so. I think we have to realize that there is something wrong with people. Just talk to a Sanders supporter about Ron Paul and you&#39;ll see that many of them wouldn&#39;t have supported Paul either. This idea of Sanders fighting against the big corporations is just an angle to set him apart from the rest, but his agenda is really just the same as all the rest. He&#39;s for big government.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J4TLIPB1uc">Even Ron Paul talked about Sanders and said that while many times they agreed about corruption and cronyism, Sanders was still pro-war and had a foreign policy like all the rest.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not (by a long shot) a sanders supporter. If it were <em>just</em> him vs. hillary, then it would be the clear choice, but it isn&#39;t. </p>

<p>There was so much support for ron paul, and it was real support, for a real platform. If you looked at any straw poll he did very well. Also, if you saw a bumper sticker (still to this day) it probably said &quot;ron paul&quot; and if there was a group of people on the corner with signs it was probably &quot;ron paul&quot;.</p>

<p>If you look at the iowa one he had a huge amount of people there, and the winning candidate bussed people in to see a free country music show that was closed off to the rest of the attendees. even after all of that it took the &quot;men behind the curtain&quot; 6 hours to count electronic votes...</p>

<p>This leads me to the last point. The parties and primaries are 100% private (not government) and can do whatever they want. If they want to have sham primaries and select the candidate by lying about the outcome, it might trigger a scandal, but it is not breaking any laws.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why I made sure to include that <em>his own party</em> disagrees. And I should have said &quot;former first minister&quot;. Word missing.</p>

<p>I could also point out that the Prime Minister himself disagrees with Tulip Siddiq on the Trump issue. And you don&#39;t get more &quot;establishment&quot; than David Cameron</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Like I said, feel free to ignore evidence</p>

<p>Ugh. Don&#39;t do that. Your own posts ignore the party leaders who disagree and only mentions the outliers who want to ban him. That&#39;s extremely selective and a wider reading shows that your original point is, not to put too fine a point on it, bullshit.</p>

<p>Well now you&#39;re just changing the goalposts. Being negative about somebody is not the same as calling for a ban. Duh.</p>

<p>Are we to assume that the only reason they don&#39;t want to ban him is because they&#39;ll look stupid? Why can&#39;t it be possible that a lot of people dislike Trump but don&#39;t agree with the idea of banning him from their country?</p>

<p>Keep up the misinformation though, nice try. It probably works on <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>[1] </p>

<p><em>What fucking misinformation?</em></p>

<p>Pointing out that the examples you supplied are pretty much irrelevant to the wider discussion on banning Trump is &quot;misinformation&quot; all of a sudden? Please.</p>

<p>I never claimed you did. I&#39;m saying the wider picture doesn&#39;t support your initial claim. </p>

<p>Example - </p>

<p>When one opposition MP is in favour of a ban, and the leader of the country is not, is it not misleading to say that &quot;establishment politicians&quot; are in favour of a ban?</p>

<p>You might be technically correct (depending on your definition of establishment) in that more than one elected politician favours a ban, but the general picture disagrees. Do you see what I mean?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Tantrum? Ok whatever.</p>

<p>If you want to know why I&#39;m downvoting you, it&#39;s better to ask rather than make stuff up. For the record I think your argument is ludicrous and getting worse, the fact that you&#39;re now inventing my motives and ignoring most of what I&#39;m saying is telling.</p>

<p>Or not. Maybe you&#39;re right but unable to communicate why.</p>

Taken with the comment I was replying to I think a fair reading is that the &quot;nobody&quot; applies to your claim of &quot;establishment politicians&quot;.

<p>Why? Trump&#39;s a fine candidate &amp; the best you&#39;re gonna get against this witch. Bernie, while he has a vocal support &amp; all, just doesn&#39;t have the numbers &amp; backing.

<p>Good god, that line again. You know he&#39;s not always been a politician, right? He&#39;s given money to tons of other candidates over the years on both sides. Which tends to, you know, be the norm for people who own high profile multi billion dollar companies. As if Bernie isn&#39;t taking money from the Unions to run his campaign.</p>

<p>I know you&#39;ve probably got it in your head that all politicians are, or should be, some noble creatures, but that&#39;s just not how it works. Its always the lesser of evils. Hillary is obviously the fucking devil in a pants suit, that we all know. Bernie can&#39;t win the Dem nomination (any moron that&#39;s followed politics for more than a single election cycle understands how &amp; why that is).</p>

<p>So put your big boy pants on, vote Trump if you wanna beat Hillary, or stay home &amp; sulk. The end.</p>

She has no interest in breaking up big banks for prosecuting white collar criminals.  She has no interest in peace.  </p>

<p>She is a global weapons and energy dealer and everything that comes out of her mouth is rhetoric and her trying to appeal to the middle class which she shares nothing in common with.  How is she any different than Rubio?  Because she is antigun and pro-choice?  Because she wants more taxes rather than less?  Where are those taxes going?  Because she is pro-immigration?  These causes are superficial.  It&#39;s the same game.  Public private partnerships for everything and never ending war on the poor and countries with dark people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a full-time working, married mother of one. I pay my dues in the work force and breastfed my son for an entire year. I also could have never done this without the support of my husband. We are a team so the whole &quot;feminist&quot; movement annoys the shit out of me. I understand why it&#39;s a thing and why woman should be equal compared to men in life and the work force, but I don&#39;t see why it&#39;s necessary to hate or belittle men to make this happen. My husband also works full time but he works opposite shifts so he&#39;s actually home with our son more. He&#39;s a stay at home dad 4 days a week while I work, then works 36-40 hours in 3 days. Families are different than they used to be. </p>

<p>Anyway, To get back from the tangent I just went off on, if a woman votes for HRC because she has a Vagina, than that woman does NOT understand what the fuck she is doing or voting for. If a feminist really wanted to vote on a candidate who cared about equal rights, they&#39;d vote for Bernie Sander&#39;s. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Feminism isn&#39;t about hating or belittling men. It&#39;s not a zero sum movement. Fundamentally it&#39;s about ensuring women have an equal number of (respected) choices as men... and that includes your dynamic of being a stay at home mom. Feminists respect and value the deal between you and your husband, just as much as they value a woman&#39;s ability to succeed in traditionally male dominated fields. Most (barring a handful of radical feminists) understand the importance of working with men to make equality happen. Most feminists also recognize that men have a set of their own difficulties.</p>

<p>I&#39;m always disturbed when feminism gets the label as an angry movement set to undermine men. I see this misinterpretation as another way of trying to divide the people through our differences. It&#39;s the whole &quot;united we stand, divided we fall,&quot;-type thing. </p>

<p>Yes, have heard of a few Bush Republican women that are considering HRC &quot;because it&#39;s be great to let a women have a go at it&quot;, though I can see the sentiment and appeal, I just think there isn&#39;t really a worse women to have. Bill&#39;s StateSec (the short chubby white haired Jewish looking lady, forget her name right now, said it was reasonable to have 500k Iraqi kids die on sanctions) might be better or worse, given she&#39;s 80 I can&#39;t make up my mind either way.

<p>First, he is an independent running as a democrat. He&#39;s probably wise to avoid attacking a popular figure in the party when he really isn&#39;t a part of the party.</p>

<p>Second, he wants to keep to the issues. Attacking Clinton is almost necessarily personal as her political experience, in her own right, is limited. The Clintons are experts at playing the victim when their personality flaws are exposed. Therefore, his game plan is to say &quot;Hillary is just great and would be a great democratic nominee, but let me explain to you why she would suck at regulating wall street.&quot;</p>

<p>I agree. I voted for Nader as well. The two party system produces a psuedo-choice. Bill Clinton&#39;s political mentor Prof. Carroll Quigley in his book, &quot;Tragedy and Hope&quot; put it best;</p>

<p>&quot;The chief problem of American political life for a long time has been how to make the two Congressional parties more national and international. The argument that the two parties should represent opposed ideals and policies, one, perhaps, of the Right and the other of the Left, is a foolish idea acceptable only to doctrinaire and academic thinkers. Instead, the two parties should be almost identical, so that the American people can “throw the rascals out” at any election without leading to any profound or extensive shifts in policy … [E]ither party in office becomes in time corrupt, tired, unenterprising, and vigorless. Then it should be possible to replace it, every four years if necessary, by the other party, which will be none of those things but will still pursue, with new vigor, approximately the same basic policies.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am 24. I have friends in ALL age groups but I normally hang out with the &quot;older&quot; crowds because most people my age aren&#39;t married with children (like I am). The majority of people my age that I&#39;m friends with don&#39;t give a flying fuck about politics. The people older than me are either republican, support Bernie, or don&#39;t really know who they want to vote for. I don&#39;t take all of my Knowledge from people I know personally. I work on Marketing so I pull a lot of insight reports on the candidates. It just DOES NOT make sense that Hillary is doing so well with the popular vote. Even old people have Facebook now, so it just doesn&#39;t make sense that she is polling as well as she is. </p>

<p>That&#39;s because that&#39;s his demographic. Old people don&#39;t use the internet like young people do. Reddit and other liberal websites are obviously going to be Sanders-skewed. It&#39;s like only watching Fox News and being confused that Obama won the presidency. </p>

<p>There is no larger conspiracy of news source vying for Hillary and editing poll results. Is there a media bias? Sure. But it would be unethical to fudge poll results and report and pretty hard to keep the people who would know quiet. </p>

<p>Hillary is liked by the average democratic, middle class baby boomer, and because there are more of them and young people don&#39;t vote, only they matter. </p>

Most of them enjoy spending their free time watching reality tv and television in general. None of them spend anywhere near the amount of time that I spend on the internet and because of that their image of Bernie and Hilary are massively skewed.  It was not until I started showing them info on Bernie and Hilary did their opinions start to change, I have got a republican to say he would vote for Bernie. I feel this is what a large part of the Hilary supports are, just uninformed liberals, and with the media largely not covering Bernie they stay Hilary supports because all her soundbits sound good and they don&#39;t both researching anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would vote for Hillary. She seems the least likely to blow up the economy, and she seems the least likely to conduct foreign affairs based on bravado and posturing (<em>ahem</em> entire Republican lineup <em>ahem</em>). Email stuff doesn&#39;t really bother me, and the whole not classifying info stuff seems overblown to me. She&#39;s the secretary of state, classifications are complicated, especially between departments, and kind of up to her. As best I can tell, she&#39;s a real politic leader that trusts the mainstream economists with the economy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just don&#39;t agree with the whole Wall street hate/wall street is evil. Yeah, the financial sector REALLY fucked up during the 2000&#39;s, and yes they were driven by a desire to make money. But that doesn&#39;t mean we would be better off without the financial innovations they are producing. It&#39;s weird to think about because the modern economy is so ephemeral, but the complicated financial technologies we&#39;ve developed help us just as much as aerospace tech or manufacturing tech or whatever. Figuring out the optimal flow of money, freeing up more resources for investment, and minimizing investment risk helps the economy overall.</p>

<p>I will totally agree with the sentiment that too much inequality is Bad with a capital B. BUT, mainstream economists are definitely not certain that inequality is at a bad level in the US currently. I mean, real wages have risen overall over the past few years, not just for the wealthy. And they ARE certain that there&#39;s no easy way to fix that inequality without messing up the rest of the economy in the process.</p>

<p>Basically, I don&#39;t understand the economy, since I&#39;m a physicist, not an economist. But there are people who understand economics better than I do. Not perfectly, but our best guess is whatever the people who study this stuff say. And the person who is going to listen to them, the person who is going to be reasonable, is either Jeb or Hillary. And there&#39;s some things I won&#39;t do, and among them is elect another Bush (Seriously, wtf even WAS the Iraq war? Like seriously wtf).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, (wanted to make a new comment because my first was getting to be a wall of text) her driving the debt up doesn&#39;t bother me. It&#39;s my understanding that the only statistic that matters about the debt is debt as a percentage of GDP. Ours is around 100%, which isn&#39;t all that bad. Plenty of other countries are leveraged far more, and haven&#39;t collapsed or anything. Debt for a country is fundamentally different from debt for a person. A country never retires, and you can much more accurately predict medium term and long term performance. Wouldn&#39;t it be silly to not take people&#39;s money that are willing to invest in you at near zero interest rates? Mainstream economists are more concerned about candidates that endorse contractionary policies. At least that&#39;s my understanding of how this stuff works.</p>

<p>It&#39;s recovering from one of the greatest shocks since the stock market crash in 1929. The economy is definitely getting better, that can just be a slow process, and it can be hard on young people who are locked out of the job market because people had to postpone retirement because their investments all tanked in 2008. But there are no easy solutions to these problems, no matter what a politician might tell you.</p>

<p>Since she has no competition, there is no contest for the primary, and not need for anyone in the Democrat party to get all that energized or anything at all until the general election starts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;how did Nixon get elected? Nobody I know voted for him.&quot; I forget who said that but it&#39;s a famous quote. You don&#39;t hang out with a lot of soccer moms, union members, middle aged blacks. With the GOP splintered, and sanders a dark horse, Clinton is leading the pac right now. She has her ducks in a row. She has near universal name recognition, people like her or hate her but they know who she is.
That&#39;s huge. Most Americans dont know who Bernie Sanders is.
As a former senator she has been able to line up delegates and has a 2 billion campaign warchest (i count the clinton foundation in that; the foundation was always there to support her campaign.)
People still like Bill C, and he&#39;s had his two terms.
She&#39;s a stand-in for him, in some ways.
I expect she will get Obama&#39;s endorsement.
Some people are eager to vote for any woman, even Hillary.
If the GOP nominates Trump, or someone far right, she will pick up much of the moderate middle.
She started running long before everybody but Biden,and Biden&#39;s out of the race now. Starting earlier is a big factor.
I strongly don&#39;t like her.
But she&#39;s got the resume, the cash, and the will to power.
She&#39;s the front runner.
Also, she comes off as more moderate than Sanders.
A lot of democrats aren&#39;t sure  he&#39;s electable. Nice guy,
sincere, but pretty far left even for the Dems. How would he do in the south, and in the suburbs?</p>

They&#39;ll just wait until they pull the curtain shut to show their support.  Having said that, I still believe her poll numbers are hyped and that Sanders would do better against Trump.  But they already have the T-shirts printed as the saying goes - 
 Clinton vs. Trump </p>

<p><strong>The Clintons and Mind Controlled Sex Slaves</strong></p>

<p>The account of Cathy O’Brien in regards to the Clintons is very revealing (I wrote about this in the article Hillary Clinton 2016). O’Brien is a former mind control victim who suffered horrific SRA (Satanic Ritual Abuse) at the hands of her handlers, who programmed her to become a sex slave. You can read her story in her book Trance-Formation of America. She explicitly mentions being abused and repeatedly raped by many high-ranking politicians including George Bush Sr., Dick Cheney, Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would make an observation. There are two types of fame: 1) In which you&#39;re famous for being yourself [e.g., John Lennon, Picasso, Socrates, etc], and 2) In which you aren&#39;t famous in and of yourself, but you&#39;re famous for an office you hold. (For instance, a general in the military, or a politician who is treated like a god while he&#39;s in power, but once out of power, he can&#39;t get arrested. This happens because he was never liked for himself, per se, but for the power he represented.)</p>

<p>Establishment candidates like Hillary Clinton are not liked for themselves. People will merely throw the lever for her because she represents &quot;Generic Democrat&quot;.</p>

<p>As a result, she doesn&#39;t NEED to have a deep support-base of people who actually like her as a person, or agree with any of her policies. Once a teamster gets behind the curtain, he&#39;ll mindlessly pull the lever for &quot;Generic Democrat&quot;. And this time around: That&#39;s Hillary Clinton. The same impulse will be in effect for people affiliated with teachers&#39; unions, African-Americans in urban areas, transgendered wheelchair-bound Greenpeace activists, etc.</p>

<p>All will throw the switch for &quot;Generic Democrat,&quot; no matter who that generic Democrat is.</p>

<p>On the Republican side, it&#39;s more competitive. All the official establishment candidates [with the exception of Kasich and Rubio] are out. So, on the Republican side, people are actually voting for candidates based on their own personalities and policy positions.</p>

<p>Hillary&#39;s position is far more depressing. Even her own rank-and-file dislike her. But they&#39;ll throw the lever for her because they&#39;re told to vote in &quot;Generic Democrat&quot;.</p>

<p>Left to her own devices, Hillary would have trouble filling a Burger King to have people hear her speeches. And in fact Democratic strategists have expressed concern that she&#39;s unable to get Trump-sized crowds.</p>

<p>Say what you will about him, but Trump actually has die-hard supporters. Hillary doesn&#39;t. She has lukewarm supporters who will only vote for her perfunctorily.</p>

<p>So in summation: To the person who says that they&#39;ve never met a Hillary supporter in real life--- Just change the question. Don&#39;t look for the term &quot;Hillary&quot;. Listen for the more appropriate sound of people voting for &quot;Generic Democrat&quot; and there you&#39;ll find her support-base.</p>

<ul>
<li>Footnote: Hillary&#39;s great strength (and her great weakness) is the fact that people will vote for her, despite not particularly liking her much. Even the traditionally Democrat-leaning media portray her thusly: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXdNYXMQoy8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXdNYXMQoy8</a></li>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m an anarchist and I think voting is a sham, but if I did believe in the system, then I would support Hiliary over Sanders. Both Sanders and Trump give the impression of rash, impulsive behavior. Clinton shows experience and stability. </p>

<p>I think the way people approach elections is that they try to vote for someone that aligns with their views. Sanders captures the young and disenfranchised, whereas Clinton caters to older, business types.</p>

<p>There&#39;s just too much money in it. We will get the person that can sell the most for existing industries. Those industries are there to fulfill demand and others are there to install demand. </p>

<p>Yes, wouldn&#39;t change a damn thing. We have a deep state. The NSA (Think KGB, Stasi) has dirt on all these dirty fucks. They will be blackmailed, black balled, and coerced into TPTB&#39;s bidding. If you shake the boat too much, look at JFK. Mind you, he came from the elite families of yesterdays. You don&#39;t fuck with the deep state.</p>

<p>the fact the republican party exists at all is the result of the most sophisticated and huge fraud in history.</p>

<p>the situation is grim, the government at this time exhibits very few if any actual american values, and the citizens statistically have no say</p>

<p>things that 90 percent agree on are completely impossible because bribery and fraud in congress, and theres no way to investigate without being accused of terrorism etc</p>
