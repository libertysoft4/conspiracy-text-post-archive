<p>. . .The map above represents compiled temperature readings over the last two years. How can the eastern US be so anomalously cold while the whole of the Arctic is in superheating, the western US is burning up, and while all of Siberia and most of the rest of the world is in meltdown? </p>

<p>Recent peer reviewed study proves extreme and anomalous cold events ARE NOT connected to global warming, so what is the cause? Welcome to the world of climate engineering. The constant engineered cool-downs of the eastern US are psychological operation to hide the true extent of climate disintegration from the US population for as long as possible while the power structure makes preparations for total collapse.</p>

<p>Climate scientists cannot (or will not) yet openly admit to the geoengineering elephant in the room, but it seems they are finally concerned enough to begin shining some light on the issue. Based on all available data, the conclusions of geoengineeringwatch.org have always been that global geoengineering programs were making an already bad climate situation far worse. </p>

<p>This conclusion continues to be confirmed as new studies are published. Climate engineering has completely derailed and disrupted the entire life support system of planet Earth and contaminated the biosphere from the clouds to the ground in the process. The repercussions of the ongoing atmospheric aerosol spraying assault (combined with the constant bombardment of radio frequency transmissions), has now pushed our planet well past the breaking point. </p>

<p>Though the scientific community is still not directly acknowledging the geoengineering reality, they are moving ever closer to coming out of the shadows.</p>

<p>Lol you clearly either don&#39;t understand what &#39;proves&#39; means or did not read the study. They studied data and have presented a theoretical idea which even they do not claim as proof of anything. Ironically I reckon if I posted peer reviewed papers which claimed the opposite you would dismiss the scientists as paid shills.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Geoengineering is NOT &#39;chemtrails&#39;. Trying to tie the really serious issue of geoengineering with so-called chemtrails is as pathetic as it is deceptive. Geoengineering trials are taking place every day and none of you are interested in stopping it or even discussing it. You sit there posting photos of the sky and agreeing it&#39;s &quot;Disgusting&quot; while the dangers of geoengineering go on unchallenged because you are all looking in the wrong fucking place. Geoengineering, with the aluminium and the barium and the sulphides and stuff, is being experimented on in the Stratosphere at 80,000 feet where you can&#39;t see it. That&#39;s why it&#39;s called <strong>Stratospheric</strong> Aerosol Dispersal. It&#39;s only experimental at the moment; small payloads of reflectants carried up by balloons and rockets.</p>

<p>But there are people who want to seriously mess with the weather. Any attempt to mess with the atmosphere will have serious and unexpected consequences. Forget about Chemtrails, THAT is where the threat to the planet is happening. Contrails coming off airliners - your so-called &#39;Chemtrails&#39; - happen at half the altitude of Stratospheric Aerosol Dispersal at 25 - 40,000 feet in the Troposphere. They really are just ice crystals which grow or dissipate depending on the weather. They are not part of any geoengineering scheme and they&#39;ve been happening ever since man was clever enough to fly high enough, in 1922.</p>

<p>Where I disagree is that barium, aluminum, and other toxic elements are also dispersed lower than the just the stratosphere. </p>
