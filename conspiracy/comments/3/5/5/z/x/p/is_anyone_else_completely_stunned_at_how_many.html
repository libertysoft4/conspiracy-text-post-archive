<p>Sanders&#39; donors are mostly unions.</p>

<p>Obama&#39;s donors are big businesses including a lot of big banks - Goldman Sachs, Microsoft, JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup, Google, Time Warner.</p>

<p>Definitely not the same owners / bosses. Check out <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org">http://www.opensecrets.org</a> for more detailed info.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If his role is to be a puppet, then the banks would donate the money for the privilege of shoving their collective hands up his ass to be the puppeteers.</p>

<p>Look at who donates to a candidate. That is who the candidate works for.</p>

<p>Look at Obama&#39;s donors. What has he done to corral the big banks, big media, big tech?</p>

<p>NOTHING. In fact, it seems like more policies and such get enacted to enable those very organizations to become more powerful. Take, for example, the latest and greatest issue with the big banks where they get to take even more risks, but the government (we, the taxpayers) foot the bill if and when things go awry.</p>

<p>You&#39;re going to have to do more than simply assert that Bernie is flawed just because he did the prudent thing (declare Democrat) to actually have a chance of geting elected. You&#39;re going to have to find something - <em>anything</em> - that looks shady about him.</p>

<p>Good luck, but, again, do let us know if you find anything tangible.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve made that assertion many times in this thread, but it&#39;s unsupported by the facts, most notably the donor lists and the extent to which candidates actually do work for their donors.</p>

<p>Have you even looked at the donor lists for Obama, Hillary, Romney, and Sanders? If so, have you considered how those donors have impacted their decisions while in office and/or campaigning? Do you understand what I&#39;m talking about?</p>

<p>After he declared as Democrat and that he was running, he introduced a bill that would shred the big banks, the biggest puppetmasters in the country.</p>

<p>Again... what&#39;s your point? Who would you prefer be the next President:</p>

<p>a) Anyone the GOP puts up</p>

<p>b) Clinton</p>

<p>c) Sanders</p>

<p>d) Fill in the blank with a viable candidate: __________________</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bernie Sanders is by far the most consistently honest candidate in the race. Agree with him or not, you know what he stands for and you know his voting record. It never depends on what the definition of &quot;is&quot; is.</p>

<p>Due to his long-standing criticism of the influence of big-money interests on government, Sanders has strong online and grassroots appeal, which he hopes to leverage to raise the money needed to fund a presidential campaign. And so far, the strategy looks savvy. The campaign has received roughly 75,000 contributions, and the average amount is $43. <strong>According to a campaign adviser, 99.4 percent of the donations have been $250 or less</strong>, and 185,000 supporters have signed up on the website BernieSanders.com.</p>
