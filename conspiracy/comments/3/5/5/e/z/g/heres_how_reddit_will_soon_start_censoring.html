<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/352twf/were_sharing_our_companys_core_values_with_the/cr0ift2?context=3">We have a problem right now where there are people/communities that exist under the &quot;freedom of expression&quot; point, that do not create a safe space to encourage participation.</a></p>

<p><strong>The order of these points is important and a safe space to have discourse is of the upmost importance to reddit.</strong> We are working on changes to make reddit a safer space for discourse.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/352twf/were_sharing_our_companys_core_values_with_the/cr0hj9k">We agree 100%. We wanted to put these values out now, as you will begin to see changes roll out to many things as early as next week. We have a lot of things rolling out over the coming months.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/34dqzp/thoughts_on_my_shadowbanning_my_love_for_black/cqum17s?context=3">Here&#39;s Ellen Pao assuring the subreddit that founded /r/discusstheopenletter that changes are, indeed, coming to reddit.</a>  </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ellen Pao: We do care, and we are making changes that will improve the site. I&#39;m definitely not happy with where we are and the direction the conversations are heading.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And for those following the Ellen Pao topic:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="https://archive.is/m0TKK#selection-1615.15-1615.78">Ohanian said he hoped Pao would become the site&#39;s permanent CEO</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here are the corporate values that will be rolled out in a few days:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/about/values">https://www.reddit.com/about/values</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.redditblog.com/2015/05/were-sharing-our-companys-core-values.html">http://www.redditblog.com/2015/05/were-sharing-our-companys-core-values.html</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Create a safe space to encourage participation.  [subjective censorship of offensive and unpopular ideas]</li>
<li>Champion diversity.   [Identity politics, be sure to highlight your token minority]</li>
</ul>

<p>They also have a few freedom of speech, embrace anonymity fluff, but the admins are making it clear <strong>these statements are only superficial and there to look good, enforcing censorship and making sure things don&#39;t offend take priority</strong>.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Even those outside of reddit are trying to pressure &amp; shame the admins into enforcing a safe space of censorship.  Here is the new article on this by Sam &quot;Bring Back Bullying&quot; Biddle of Gawker: <a href="https://archive.is/NAChz">Reddit The Home of &quot;CoonTown,&quot; Promises to &quot;Celebrate Diversity&quot;(via archive.is)</a> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reddit has never been a values-based community, which is why it’s become synonymous with stolen nudes, “men’s rights,” GamerGate, and lonely people ejaculating on anime figurines. But those corners of the site aren’t even its most loathsome.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The real core value of the people in charge of Reddit is the belief that if the internet is going to have a massive cesspit of reactionary abuse and racist garbage, it might as well be their cesspit&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you aren&#39;t familiar a few years ago another Gawker &quot;journalist&quot; Adrian Chen trolled reddit &amp; doxxed a reddit user causing policy changes and a ban for any direct links to Gawker Media from many of the largest subreddits.  SRS created fake subreddits &amp; blogs of preteens in sexual poses and fed the info to this reporter to cause policy changes and paint reddit poorly.  As the moderators became more corrupt though many of those bans were reversed, you can read in the modtalk leaks how staff of Gawker and their subsidiaries asked subreddit moderators to do so.</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.is/m0TKK">And here is Vice doing the same</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reddit knows it has a problem with misogyny, racism, homophobia, and various other forms of bigotry.<br/>
women, people of color, LGBT people, and other minorities are often abused on certain parts of the site  </p>

<p>Reddit is such a huge conglomeration of miniature communities, some of which have values that are overtly racist, homophobic, misogynistic, or creepy. Some of these communities are outright hate groups, and Reddit not only allows them to flourish, but, in fact, believes that they&#39;re part of its massive success</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p>In case you were wondering what the open letter is, it is the policy that mods from the subreddits <a href="https://archive.is/v5S0C">in this list</a> have been discussing with the admins in a only recently non-private subreddit <a href="/r/discusstheopenletter">/r/discusstheopenletter</a> , even though they are getting what they want, even though they are getting their priorities, right now they are saying it isn&#39;t enough and it isn&#39;t good enough.</p>

<p>Just in case they make it private again, I ran a script and archived their subreddit: <a href="http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=E0AnAN9y">discusstheopenletter-Nov-15-2014-may-06-2015-arch.tsv</a> that is a tab separated value spreadsheet for programs like excel.</p>

<p>A very small highlight of the many very open to discussion(but made in private in the <a href="/r/discusstheopenletter">/r/discusstheopenletter</a> subreddit until the stuff got passed ) non-sexists subreddits who are determining the new policies  </p>

<h3><strong><a href="/r/isconspiracyracist">/r/isconspiracyracist</a></strong> ,  <a href="/r/marxism">/r/marxism</a>, <a href="/r/communism">/r/communism</a> , <a href="/r/socialism">/r/socialism</a> ,  <a href="/r/socialjustice">/r/socialjustice</a> , <a href="/r/SRSFeminism">/r/SRSFeminism</a> ,  <a href="/r/SRSFempire">/r/SRSFempire</a> , <a href="/r/atheismplus">/r/atheismplus</a></h3>

<p>that are part of the discussion.  I&#39;m being sarcastic, these subs take pride in banning people for anything from no reason at all and fun, guilt by association, wrong gender, wrong color, even banning if you are the right color and gender but not the right kind of progressive, and they enjoy mocking you all the way.</p>

<p>You can find almost the whole list here: <a href="https://archive.is/v5S0C">https://archive.is/v5S0C</a>  </p>

<p>Here are some of the discussions from in there:</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.is/6ploj">https://archive.is/6ploj</a>   </p>

<p><a href="https://archive.is/EiA42#selection-1503.0-1503.347">https://archive.is/EiA42#selection-1503.0-1503.347</a>    </p>

<p>You&#39;ll also notice our friendly moderator of several subreddits fritzly aka datafucker in there shaming the co-founder of reddit into policing &amp; locking down the website by calling him the &quot;Alexis Ohanian, the hero of the racists, the sexists, and the hateful.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One thing I think that&#39;s important to keep in mind is that this is going to be presented as &#39;trolls&#39; vs SJW types. I even see those lines being drawn in some of the discussions already. </p>

<p>This is about corporate and governmental censorship. It is about having us argue and point fingers at other groups when they are <em>not</em> the driving force. </p>

<p>Reddit is absolutely ripe to be manipulated. More and more corporate friendly accounts and controversy-reducing rules seem to be popping up everywhere. </p>

<p>Remember in the 90&#39;s when political correctness started to really be focused on? Hello new trade agreements and neoliberal deregulation!</p>

<p>And now there seems to be a new wave of similar discussion - not just the PC stuff itself, but an endless echo chamber of debate over its impact and effect. </p>

<p>Meanwhile the TPP is being negotiated behind our backs and the patriot act is creeping back into play. </p>

<p>Please please please focus on what&#39;s really going on here. I&#39;m not saying that issues of speech and censorship shouldn&#39;t be discussed. </p>

<p>I&#39;m saying that they are hiding behind identity politics to keep people distracted while they implement more policies to loot the globe. </p>

<p>The most obnoxious SJW stereotype and the most obnoxious MRA stereotype have a lot more in common than not. Neither benefits from criminalizing encryption, or additional forms of corporate sovereignty. </p>

<p>Remember what&#39;s important, and focus on what&#39;s happening behind the scenes, and not the things they use to divide us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This this this this this! Who the flying fuck gives a shit if you make fun of someone on reddit and they can get you banned and you can&#39;t talk here anymore? Is your virtual opinion really that important to you that it over shadows the real toxic dilemma we&#39;re faced with? I&#39;ve never been much of a forum goer since I&#39;ve been active on reddit, but I&#39;ve heard of this happening before and the vast majority of people don&#39;t like it and migrate. You can still go out side right now and say &quot;fuck obama&quot; at the top of your lungs without a group of guys throwing a bag over your head and taking you to some camp in an unidentified location. Let this happen. Let reddit limit speech and watch as its ran into the ground.</p>

<p>I&#39;m angry that this is happening to reddit, but if you hadn&#39;t of seen this coming for the last year then your own ignorance is to blame. Freedom of speech is important, and rather then let someone take it away from you, go somewhere that doesn&#39;t. Granted you wont have the hundreds of thousands of ears to listen to you, and i can understand how that might bruise some egos. </p>

<p>As far as im concerned we&#39;ve hit the ice berg, everyone finally notices, but all the life boats are gone. Only difference: after reddit sinks into the freezing Atlantic... It wont kill you.</p>

    <div class="md"><h4>Free speech: Britain’s hypocritical universities are naked before their enemies</h4>

<p><a href="http://nickcohen.net/2015/04/30/free-speech-britains-hypocritical-universities-are-naked-before-their-enemies/">Author&#39;s own blog</a> newer version.    <a href="http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2015/04/britains-hypocritical-universities-are-naked-before-their-enemies/">The Spectator a week before</a>  </p>

<p>Here are some highlights:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Most simply did not understand what freedom was, and could not grasp the need for universal human rights.</strong> They could not see themselves as others saw them, or understand that <strong>by giving up on basic principles, because they are difficult to live with, they had left themselves naked before their enemies.</strong></p>

<p>In fact, the audience came close to revolt. When I said that universities should be physically safe spaces, but the notion that students should be kept safe from ideas or arguments defeated the whole purpose of higher education, one woman suggest I was advocating child abuse. <strong>When I said that their hypocrisy would be their downfall, they saw no reason why they should not persist in double standards.</strong></p>

<p>You can use every other weapon a free country gives you to confront speakers you oppose. You can fact check them, mock and undermine them, expose their fallacies and overwhelm their defences. But you cannot ban them. <strong>Give up on that principle, and you lay yourself open to every variety of dictator and heresy hunter rigging debates and suppressing contrary opinions.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reddit by encouraging and rewarding censorious and deceptive behavior whether corporate, government, or internal is becoming weak, and starting on a process of being unable to defend against the ideologues who are preying upon the outrage that can be generated by this platform and transfered to the real world in policies and laws.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is part of a larger phenomenon that Polybius described in 146 BC in his theory of Anacyclosis.</p>

<p>In the same way that the descendants of kings and aristocrats abused their political status, so too will the descendants of democrats. Accordingly, democracy degenerates into &quot;ochlocracy&quot;, literally, &quot;mob-rule&quot;. During ochlocracy, according to Polybius, the people of the state will become corrupted, and will develop a sense of entitlement and will be conditioned to accept the pandering of demagogues.</p>

<p>Eventually, the state will be engulfed in chaos, and the competing claims of demagogues will culminate in a single (sometimes virtuous) demagogue claiming absolute power, bringing the state full-circle back to monarchy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great points and well put. The comparison to the PC wave of the 90s really struck me, because I often see parallels between that and the sort of new-wave-fabrication that sprung into popularity and is now rearing its head. </p>

<p>Foremost, to me, is that true-believers of the re-fabbed version deeply believes their movement is immune from criticism. Dissent, or even considering questioning core principles, isn&#39;t an option. Personally, I don&#39;t recall that aspect in the 90s. You had those that decried something like NYPD Blue being on television, but there would also be conversations about what constitutes art, etc... </p>

<p>Perhaps most disconcerting to me is that these viewpoints are often espoused by a very privileged class, which wishes to disguise this fact. Pao, who is a multi-millionaire (I&#39;ll ignore the actions of her husband), has a very safe space. The employees of reddit, who were well compensated to compose the drivel that amounts to these vague/dreamy core values, have a very safe space. As in the 90s, a majority of Americans--who are eeking by--don&#39;t have the luxury of slipping into this ridiculous vitriol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It will definitely happen to reddit eventually if reddit continues to progressively censor and manipulate the public voice.  The people will find another forum.  The people who control reddit were careful about letting reddit grow to a large userbase, its a top 10 site, before they started to fuck with it and manipulate the content.  so we can expect millions of users to continue using reddit however the more concerned and educated users will move onto another social media site.</p>

<p>&quot;Everywhere his (Horus) government is taking root. Observe for yourselves the decay of the sense of sin, the growth of innocence and irresponsibility, the strange modifications of the reproductive instinct with a tendency to become bi-sexual or epicene, the childlike confidence in progress combined with nightmare fear of catastrophe, against which we are yet half unwilling to take precautions. Consider the popularity of the cinema, the wireless, the football pools and guessing competitions, <strong>all devices for soothing fractious infants</strong>, no seed of purpose in them. Consider sport, the babyish enthusiasms and rages which it excites, whole nations disturbed by disputes between boys. Consider war, the atrocities which occur daily and leave us unmoved and hardly worried. We are children.&quot; -Aleister Crowley</p>

Crowley posited that the previous two were the Aeons of Isis and Osiris, characterized by ancient matriarchal groups and classical and medieval patriarchy respectively. Horus, the child of Isis and Osiris, was the spirit associated with the third Aeon that he believed was beginning to emerge. I&#39;m not sure about the context of the quote above, as overall the Aeon of Horus is considered to be a vast improvement for mankind, characterized by freedom and individual empowerment.</p>

<p>Really just intended to amp up the <em>kulturkampf</em>.  You&#39;re being manipulated culturally here.  Reddit can&#39;t censor freedom of speech except on this site, and even then only to a limited degree.</p>

<p>The proof that it&#39;s a Strategy of Tension FF in itself is the absence of any grassroots organized &quot;SJW&quot; effort to initiate this policy.  It&#39;s pure top-down.  And that means it&#39;s a FF.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From highly upvoted comments by karmanaut:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have seen regular brigading from places like <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a>, <a href="/r/HailCorporate">/r/HailCorporate</a>, <a href="/r/ShitRedditSays">/r/ShitRedditSays</a>... etc. And nothing is ever done about it because the admins seem worried about the narrative that would come about from doing anything. </p>

<p><a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a> and <a href="/r/Hailcorporate">/r/Hailcorporate</a> have done so much bannable shit from brigading to doxxing, and yet they are still around. Why? Because the admins are more concerned about the potential backlash and narrative from banning those subreddits than from actually enforcing their own rules consistently. Instead, it seems like the admins simply come up with ad-hoc excuses for doing things instead of creating and enforcing a consistent ruleset. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are obsessed with narratives, and with lies, but these are primarily tools. Truly, what they are obsessed with is power and control. What kind of people are obsessed with power and control? Psychopaths. <strong>What the SJW movement <em>is</em>, is passive-aggressive psychopathy</strong>. They don&#39;t feel personally empowered or in control of their own lives, so they bask in playing the victim because our society empowers victims. In every instance of &#39;victim&#39; vs &#39;perpetrator&#39;, the victim is instantly deferred to, without consideration of evidence or due process. Therefore, if they can <em>create</em> a situation in which a person has &#39;victimized&#39; them, they instantly have power over that person. This is why the &#39;trigger&#39; narrative has gained so much traction; it has built, and somehow managed to legitimize, a framework in which <em>literally anything</em> can be seen as aggression, regardless of intent or context. They are victims-in-waiting. They can become a victim of, and therefore exert power over, any person, at any time, for any reason, by playing the &#39;triggered&#39; card. It&#39;s as brilliant as it is sick.</p>

<p>What is most interesting is why such a toxic, shrill and polarizing community has been given such an outsized voice in media. Why has a hugely unpopular minority been allowed to dictate, <em>for example</em>, the so-called core-values of a site like Reddit? The seemingly obvious answer is that, since the SJW &#39;trigger&#39; narrative is manufactured, and thereore SJW outrage is manufactured, <em>the movement itself is manufactured.</em> <strong>The SJW movement doesn&#39;t exist to promote equality, it exists to stifle dissent</strong>. Create an army of victims, provide them with a &#39;legitimate&#39; outlet for their rage, and sic them on any person or group that needs to be neutralized. In that way, they&#39;re like police dogs: kept in their cage and coddled until they&#39;ve heard the trigger word, then they&#39;re let off the leash when it&#39;s time to go for the bad man&#39;s throat. They&#39;ve been manipulated and their lack of personal power is being used against them. That their impotence being leveraged to create hurt and anger is <em>actually</em> abusive is just the ironic icing on the cake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m generalizing here but: FWIW the people I&#39;ve met who either identifies as a SJW-type or fit the characteristics very rarely seem to actually be involved in helping their communities (as in, volunteering, grassroots work, engagement with the heavily marginalised communities, etc). I&#39;ve been trying to find counterexamples to this trend for the past 6 or 7 years and they&#39;re exceptionally rare (at least in my experience). It often just seems to be a mode to validate externalising anger to heavily mythologised bogey-men and cornering people based on their perceived privileged social determinants. Same pattern as middle and upper class &quot;Marxists&quot; who discredit anyone they don&#39;t like as &quot;bourgeois&quot; without any sense of irony. Sure, some of the issues are certainly pertinent, but if one cares so much, why does one simply settle for yelling people down irl or on the internet? There seems to be a widespread belief that thought-policing discourses is more noble then like, idk, actually getting down to the gritty practical work of helping people overcome entrenched inequality and oppression. The amount of people I&#39;ve met who can say with a straight face that commenting about things on tumblr/fb/reddit is comparable to actual social/community work is mind-boggling.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a conspicuous discrepancy. Do people feel so disenfranchised all they can do is talk about issues without attempting to shift the material determinants that produce them (in a way that actually requires considerable expenditure of energy and on-going commitment)? Are people who feel personally disempowered more attracted to this kind of behaviour? It certainly seems to confer avenues for social leveraging and inter-personal power play. The way I&#39;ve seen the &quot;movement&quot; develop over the past few years, online especially, makes me sympathetic to your conclusion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You will however notice that <a href="/r/isconspiracyracist">/r/isconspiracyracist</a> is one of the subs listed as being &quot;on board&quot; with the upcoming changes. Why is that listed? A sub that exists specifically to distill all the ridiculous shitposts we see here regularly. To discount or ignore the existance of people purposely posting RIDICULOUS and obviously PROVOCATIVE content with the goal of association and ridicule is foolish. If I&#39;ve got a script that can upvote / downvote content based on keyword searches and a few friends, it&#39;s pretty easy to drive a narrative. Submit a few obviously anti-semitic posts, upvotebot them, and look: conspiracy isn&#39;t a &quot;safe area&quot;. This system is too easily gamed and has been from it&#39;s inception.  </p>

<p>Most of the subs listed there have <em>extremely</em> low numbers of subscribers. Why is it that this handful of users has such a discrepancy of representation? </p>

<p>k4rmanaut&#39;s statement itself is pretty hilarious, considering <strong>he can offer no proof</strong> that <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a> has <em>ever</em> engaged in vote-brigading. Funny that we have massive amounts of evidence that supports the premise that this sub is actively brigaded on a fairly regular basis. Don&#39;t believe me? Submit a self or linked post with any number of buzzwords and watch. </p>

<p>This sub has more &quot;anti-subscribers&quot; than any other. Thousands of the users you see in that subscription count have no other purpose here than to &quot;provide a devil&#39;s advocate&quot;, &quot;promote critical thinking&quot;, &quot;stop the circle-jerk&quot;, post ridiculous and asinine submissions, troll, or any other thinly disguised contrarian behavior.  Whole subs are dedicated to this. Why is it that this sub ( out of all the other potential targets for this kind of behavior ) is where we see the most shitposts? </p>

<p>To deny this shitposting epidemic has an organized component is foolish. It is easily demonstrated.</p>

<p>The only real solution is for the mods of this sub to start actively engaging in real moderation as opposed to this laissez-faire approach. </p>

<p>The shitposting will continue until this sub is shut-down. It has already destroyed most of the participation as well as any credibility this sub ever hoped to have.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not safe from brigading from conspiratard and topminds, let alone organisations that actively shill and brigade (ahem).</p>

<p>Ergo,</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a safe space. Heh.</p>

<p>Seriously though:</p>

<p>I think there are three main propaganda vectors that will be used to &quot;justify&quot; bringing the sub down: 1) Currently the vaccination &quot;debate&quot; (if it can be called that) has enormous political valence. This sub is a hot-bed of dissension. 2) This sub has always been a hot-bed of dissension regarding Israel&#39;s military policy and has been severely brigaded in the past for it, whereas nearly every other sub of a comparable size or larger heavily censors the topic during &quot;operations&quot;. Many of us can recall how hard this place got hit during the last siege of Gaza 3) Charges of anti-semitism - there is a small minority of posters who express genuinely anti-semitic views; it&#39;s difficult to discern if they are genuine, trolls, or masqueraders attempting to slander the sub as a whole - probably a mixture of all three.</p>

<p>I predict the above vectors will be the plutonium that detonates structural changes here. Of course there&#39;s a lot of topics which are discussed here and not elsewhere on the site, and it&#39;s in a lot of peoples&#39; interest not to have that information shared. The above will be a cover.</p>

<p>See you guys in the special circle of Social Hell padded with tinfoil where anybody who mentions war crimes in Gaza has their flesh branded &quot;ANTI-SEMITE&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Safe spaces&quot; just sounds... fucking wrong.  If anime-doll-jizzers, nazi&#39;s and whoever else can find a home here, that tells me that it&#39;s actually pretty &quot;safe&quot;.  Of course you may be ostracized or challenged about your beliefs or choices, just like in &quot;reality&quot; but chances are very high that if you belong to one of vocal minorities these policies aim to pamper, your comments will be upvoted straight to heaven while your opponent watches their karma shoot below zero.  </p>

<p>Safe spaces...  had to consult Tumblr for a definition:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A Safe Space is a place where anyone can relax and be able to fully express, without fear of being made to feel uncomfortable, unwelcome, or unsafe on account of biological sex, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, cultural background, religious affiliation, age, or physical or mental ability.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Alright, sounds good I guess, aside from the fact that I would associate safety with my physical body moreso than my feelings on the internet, it&#39;s not all bad.  We know that long-term studies have turned schoolyard logic on its head, proving that sticks and stones are in fact no match for the intense destructive power of words.  Bones heal, but feelings are forever.  </p>

<p>So great, let&#39;s ban and silence people based on a flimsy definition of what is &#39;hurtful.&#39;   Let&#39;s keep the definition of what is &#39;hurtful&#39; and who is &#39;hurt/silenced&#39; fairly loose though, you never know when it may be convenient to add or subtract protected classes from the definition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s sad about that schoolyard logic being turned on it&#39;s head is that the reason we told children that words would not hurt them was to help them steel themselves against psychological damage, to help them be stronger.

Protection of people to this extent creates dependence and the inability to deal with any adversity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly correct, I was joking with my long-term studies thing.  This whole outlook stems from a persecution complex and a bizarre modern belief that has made people believe that they have an inalienable right to not be offended.  As if being offended or &quot;triggered&quot; is enough to make people fall over in the street or outright perish from anxiety and inner pain or some shit.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not defending bigotry, I don&#39;t think anyone should be silenced for their religion, sexual orientation, gender or whatever.  The thing is, I don&#39;t seem to see much of that!  Not online or in real life, in Universities, in businesses or in society at large.  &quot;You need to shut up because you are a woman/gay/black and your voice is meaningless&quot; is a sentiment that exists more in the minds of those with a good imagination and a persecution complex than it does in reality.  This kind of baseless silencing based on physical attributes or sexual orientation is already looked down upon, and rightly so.</p>

<p>And the real kicker is, I don&#39;t know about other people and their powers, but on the internet I have a really hard time discerning the following from words people type:</p>

<ul>
<li>sex </li>
<li>age</li>
<li>sexual orientation</li>
<li>lifestyle</li>
<li>cultural background</li>
<li>religion</li>
<li>physical or mental disabilities</li>
</ul>

<p>In a way this is the beauty of discussion boards and internet communication.  It&#39;s very hard to be preoccupied with irrelevant things about the people you&#39;re speaking with.  Unless of course the person makes a point of constantly referring to their idiosyncrasies and perceived oppression status to garner sympathy and/or <strong>silence and shame</strong> others.  Then you do see it.  </p>

<p>This is an interesting march we&#39;ve seen in what might be called western liberal culture over the past while.  Those who value liberty automatically value free speech; everyone should be able to speak their mind and not be denied a voice.  This proceeded to the notion that you must allow all opinions and voices to be heard, especially from those perceived as silenced; minorities, gays etc.  Next, we must protect the right for the &#39;silenced&#39; to have a voice above others, even if that means silencing and shaming &#39;privileged&#39; classes.  </p>

<p>Now we have a climate developing where completely silencing or disregarding even educated or logical majority standpoints is completely acceptable based on the race and/or gender of the speaker.  It&#39;s not uncommon for the opinions of &quot;old white men&quot; to be chided and mocked <em>on those grounds alone.</em>  It&#39;s totally bizarre, it&#39;s like fostering free speech and free thought as a safeguard against totalitarianism and thought crime has created just that; a totalitarian system of political correctness that is worse than anything a state-based thought police division could ever imagine.  </p>

<p>Reminds me of that repeated feminist myth of &quot;Rape Culture&quot;.
They actually think that there are whole subcultures of men out there who endorse raping women. I&#39;ve been around a lot of young male sub-cultures, from &quot;frat boy&quot; to &quot;thug lyfe&quot; to &quot;yuppie&quot; and there is no group of guys anywhere who would just sit around and nod their heads and congratulate you for raping someone. &quot;Rape Culture&quot; is a complete feminist myth with no evidence to support it but so what? It has the SJW dedicated concern troll brain trust behind it, so it gets reported on by CNN anchors as if it were as real as Haven Monahan. Oh, wait...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great comment!</p>

<p>I am a person who struggles with PTSD. I, at a point in life, was terrified of a slew of things. </p>

<p>I went for help finally ...and, well, lets just say I fell for it.  All of a sudden I was a &quot;victim&quot; and had rights and needed these docs and meds and services and ..... omg. What a rollercoaster! </p>

<p>What I did find, is a smart counselor, finally, and coping skills. I felt utterly brainwashed. She helped me undo so much crap, put together a plan. If I was triggered, I stayed home or removed myself from the situation. I can&#39;t see how demanding I&#39;m catered to can help anything. </p>

<p>I found a way to get back to normal. I learned to trust myself and realize I wasn&#39;t a victim at all. </p>

<p>What caused the PTSD was bad, what happened when I trusted a system, set up to help, was worse.</p>

<p>The world can&#39;t revolve around us, we revolve around it.  It&#39;s up to me to become strong and resilient to adversity and pain. </p>

<p>Sometimes I think the social programs start off helpful, yet without people in need, funding disappears. Often times, especially with physical and mental health docs, I felt like a cash making machine.  It&#39;s an insane game</p>
