    <div class="md"><p>My opinion on the King James Bible (in its entirety) is that it&#39;s disinformative and a bunch of bullshit. For instance, what the hell does Deuteronomy or Leviticus have to do with Jesus or his message? Why are Paul&#39;s stories included in the Bible when he lived <em>300 years after christ</em>? The King James Bible was edited and published by the Roman Empire when it was clear that the vast majority of the people had become Christian. Before that, Christianity was illegal and any writings that had to do with Christianity were burned.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the only books of the Bible worth anything are the direct experiences with Jesus ie the gospels, the Book of Acts (the Holy Spirit returning to earth), and Revelations. Pretty much the New Testament is solid except for Paul. From the Old Testament, I like Genesis, Job, Psalms and Proverbs. </p>

<p>The most important thing is to understand that the King James Bible was created off a version of the <em>original</em> Bible called the Nag Hammadi. Also, the Book of Enoch (which would be considered Old Testament) is amazing. Read the Bible for yourself and decide what&#39;s bullshit and what&#39;s not. If you start reading one of the books and it says &quot;Don&#39;t get a tattoo or you&#39;re going to hell&quot;, just rip out that book and skip ahead. There is absolutely no relation between Deuteronomy or Leviticus to Jesus.</p>

<p>Here are PDF versions of the Nag Hammadi: <a href="http://khazarzar.skeptik.net/books/nhl.pdf">http://khazarzar.skeptik.net/books/nhl.pdf</a></p>

<p>And the Book of Enoch: <a href="http://www.hermetics.org/pdf/enoch.pdf">http://www.hermetics.org/pdf/enoch.pdf</a></p>

<p>EDIT: On the question of whether it&#39;s &quot;real&quot; or not:</p>

<p>I do believe Jesus was a real person as he is in both the Bible and Koran and how would it be possible for the religion to have spread they way it did if someone wasn&#39;t really sacrificed. That being said: walking on water, water to wine, healing lepers.... it&#39;s possible but not probable. That doesn&#39;t matter though. The point of the Bible isn&#39;t to read it like a historical document. The point of the Bible is to provide people with an Allegory on how to lead a just life. Does it contain <em>historic</em> truths? Maybe, maybe not. Does it contain moral Truth? Most certainly. </p>

<p>Religious texts aren&#39;t read in order to understand what happened in the past (historical nature). Religious texts are read in order to understand how to lead the &quot;Just Life&quot; as Plato called it (allegoric nature).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the Flavian&#39;s of Rome created the whole thing up based on various philosophies, pagan beliefs, and other religions of the time. It&#39;s main purpose was to convert Jews to Christianity which is a more docile belief system, to qualm the Jewish revolts against the Roman empire. Which then led to Catholicism which forever embodies the Roman empire as the rulers of the world, via the Vatican.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Both the Old and New Testaments are works of fiction set in real places with a number of historical characters who did exist (the Herods, for instance) included in the narrative, to give the impression of reality. This narrative technique is what many novelists use. For instance, although Sherlock Holmes is a entirely fictional character, the environment created for him by Conan Doyle is realistic, so the reader gets a good idea of what London in the 1890s was like. </p>

<p>Thus, New Testament gives you a flavour of what 1st century Judaea was like, without being accurate about the details. The big question regarding the New Testament is whether Jesus was a real person or a fictional character.</p>

<p>In truth, the actual historical evidence (ie from non-Biblical sources) for a Jesus of Nazareth (or Christ) figure is missing. There&#39;s nothing there when you draw the curtain apart from an almost cerainly forged mention in Josephus&#39;s writing.</p>

<p>My &quot;opinion&quot; is that the only things that are &quot;real&quot; are things for which empirical evidence exists. That is to say, the thing stating the positive claim needs to provide evidence of its claim, not the other way around. (Publishing supposition and declaring it&#39;s true until it&#39;s proved false is the logical fallacy known as <em>argumentum ad ignorantiam</em>.)</p>

<p>However, if we also want to preclude writings that directly contradict themselves from being &quot;real&quot;, I&#39;m good with that, too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every time I think of biblical references I think, &quot;I wonder if this is just a story of an extraterrestrial whom the storytellers had no frame of reference for,&quot; and that the bible is just a collection of stories about supernatural beings. Some of the stories actually start to make sense if you apply a filter of otherworldly science to it.</p>

<p>Just my two cents :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe there are things that are factual within the bible, but therr are also embellished, editted, and falsified within it, too. </p>

<p>First, if you havent already, look into the <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Council_of_Nicaea">council of nicea</a>, where the heads of the chirch got together and decided which books were to be cannonized into the bible, and which were to be omitted. The later became known as the <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_apocrypha">biblical apocrypha.</a>. </p>

<p>One of the things i choose to believe had happened is the Great Flood. Ive read theories that explained a lot of evidence towards it having occured during the end if the last ice age, around 9800 bce (some say around 11800 bce). Some researchers claimed that the salt lake city basin is able to contain eight times as much vokume as there is in salt lake. And, as they concluded, the salt concenttation of salt lake happens to be eight times thst of sea water -- meaning, if it was filled by sea water from the great flood, and had evaporated down to its current levels, we would see the same amount of salt concentration as we do now. </p>
