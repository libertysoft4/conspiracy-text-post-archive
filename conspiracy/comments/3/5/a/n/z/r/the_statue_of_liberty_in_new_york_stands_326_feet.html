        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>&quot;The distance at which lights can be seen at sea entirely disposes of the idea that we are living on a huge ball.&quot; -Thomas Winship</p>

<p>NASA and modern astronomers claim we are living on an oblate spheroid 25,000 statute miles in equatorial circumference with a curvature of 7.395 inches to the mile, varying inversely as the square of the distance, meaning in 3 miles there is a declination of nearly 6 feet, in 30 miles 600 feet, in 300 miles 60,000 feet and so on. Therefore, if we wish to prove or disprove the validity of their convexity claim, it is a fairly simple, straight forward matter of measurements and calculations.</p>

<p>Please try this at home and see for yourself. EDIT: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/6dXYC">Here</a> are some figures to help you out.</p>

<p>EDIT: I&#39;ve been shadowbanned because once I was linked to by <a href="/r/subredditdrama">/r/subredditdrama</a> and <a href="/r/topmindsofreddit">/r/topmindsofreddit</a> all of my posts were downvoted to oblivion.

<p>At sixty miles, you should be able to see 326 feet - 84 feet = 242 feet of the Statue.</p>

<p>I rounded up or approximated up at every step.  60 mile hypotenuse is an over-approximation of what underlies the 60 mile arc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha, each time there is a skip the camera moves further away (watch the horizon itself get further away as you can see more water in between), and closer to the water, and then the ship disappears into the fog. I must come to the conclusion that you haven&#39;t spent nearly as much time at sea as I have if you can&#39;t see that immediately and think the effect shown in this video is convincing or matches real life observations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously??!?!?!?! Really? !?!? It&#39;s edited for time.  It took over an hour to dissappear.  No one would sit through that unedited. Got any pictures of the edge of the earth?  How does the water not fall right off the edge? What&#39;s on the other side of the earth?  You claim proof but only have provided bad math, and poor logic. If I sent you to space to show you. Somehow you&#39;d argue with your own eyes </p>

<p>I linked <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/354b2l/one_by_one_the_free_lands_fell_to_the_power_of/">this</a> to you earlier, you could answer these questions for yourself if you just looked.</p>

<p>I also linked <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPGW9bIx_e8">this</a> to you earlier, showing some of the highest altitude non-NASA recordings, with no hint of any curvature to the Earth at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, you sure drew out the shills fast! Either that or those dealing with their own CogDis, they present about the same.</p>

<p>Look, this is conspiracy numerous uno. You can&#39;t discuss this stuff. Nobody wants to be a flat earther, much less acknowledge the truth, which you can find for yourself if you research Cyrus Teed and his Rectilineator, or the experiment that was conducted at the Tamarack Mine in Utah using Plumb Bobs.</p>

<p>Or how about Airy&#39;s failure? Mickelson Morley? Sagnac?</p>

<p>Shh.. they are not ready... are you?</p>
