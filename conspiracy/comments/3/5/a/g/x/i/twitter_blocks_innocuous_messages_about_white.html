        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Something is fishy with social networking sites like twitter and facebook. Innocuous talk about &quot;White pride&quot; and concern about demographic decline of the White population is deemed to be &quot;hate&quot; by Twitter  and other social networking sites. Yet, actual ISIS terrorists are said to have a huge social media presence and are able to repeatedly post actual violent and threatening videos and all the msm does is give their online presence even more exposure:  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/07/twitter-blocks-promoted-tweets-white-supremacist-weev-auernheimer">Twitter blocks promoted tweets by notorious white supremacist</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Among the tweets promoted by Auernheimer was one that read: <em>“Whites need to stand up for one another and defend ourselves from violence and discrimination. Our race is dying.”</em> A second promoted tweet read: <em>“White pride, world wide. Do you know the 14 words?”</em> – a reference to the white nationalist credo: “We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.”</p>

<p>But a further attempt to promote the first tweet a day later led to a rejection from Twitter, which cited a ban on ads dealing with hate content, sensitive topics and violence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Those tweets are deemed to be hateful and violate twitter&#39;s terms of service. Meanwhile, according to the ABC news program Nightline, actual terrorists from IS are purported to have a huge presence on Twitter and Facebook.</strong> They post actual violent and threatening videos and the major television networks are willing to air these promotional videos (albeit with a critical or &#39;concerned&#39; tone) on network news broadcasts:</p>

<p><a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/nightline/listing/2015-05/07-nightline-050715-how-us-officials-say-isis-uses-social-media-to-recruit">Nightline 05/07/15: How US Officials Say ISIS Uses Social Media to Recruit</a></p>

<p>I wonder if this is occurring with clandestine support from Facebook and Twitter? Even if there was an army of terrorist shills posting content from unique ip addresses why give them so much exposure in the msm? In one form or another, the western media has been regurgitating this story of the terrorist groups maintaining a major presence on social networking media and having a huge array of slickly produced recruiting videos for many months now.</p>

<p>My hunch is that the IS terrorists are still receiving support from intelligence services and all the msm talk of their slick promotional videos is intended to get useful idiots and patsies to go searching for these terrorist promotional videos. </p>

<p>Irish,French,dutch,German,Russian</p>

<p>So white pride doesn&#39;t really make sense.</p>

<p>Asian pride is pride in their culture</p>

<p>Latino pride is pride in their culture</p>

<p>Jewish pride is pride in their culture</p>

<p>White pride is pride in their skin color.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>White Americans is just america.</p>

<p>Black american were brought to this country differently, they lived in different places, ate different food, were treated different. This created a culture. This is seperated from america its own culture. Still American but not black america </p>

<p>Black Americans definitely have a right to have a different culture while still being america. Anything else are just towns and city with high immigrant count like China town.</p>

<p>If you wanna say white pride it just doesn&#39;t make sense. It would have to be caucasion pride, European pride, French pride.  Mexicans don&#39;t say brown pride usually lol Asians don&#39;t say yellow pride.  </p>

<p>If white people in america feel oppressed then I definitley don&#39;t understand.</p>

<p>I was replying to that guys complaint of not being able to use white power.</p>

<p>I said it doesn&#39;t make sense pride is a culture thing not a skin thing. Asians aren&#39;t saying yellow power they are saying their respective culture pride.</p>

<p>So white pride is just american pride. Black pride is black american pride. They have their own culture. </p>

Getting involved in community etc.Yeah but if your american why say you have white pride? Its not being proud of your culture or country its being proud in your skin
Black american pride is about culture. The culture black americans have created in america that isn&#39;t part of the status quo american culture.
Mexicans have culture, different Asian races have different culture. But no one says yellow pride.
There&#39;s no other way to label it its gotta be black american pride.
If your white then you celebrate your own culture , if its american culture,irish culture,German,dutch. But white pride doesn&#39;t make sense. For it to make sense its gotta be american pride or caucasion pride. Get it? I&#39;m not against it, it just doesnt make sense.</p>

My whole fucking point is those people should just go with american pride... Continue calling me a dumb ass please. For such a boring opinion.</p>

<p>Black american pride makes sense because the history is different the culture is different their environment is different.  So comes the title. African american. But reddit says that is considered offensive? </p>

<p>I&#39;m talking about the Africans that were kidnapped and tortured for hundred of years. They made their own culture a culture that is represented. That culture is still in america and is still being represented by black americans or african americans,</p>

<p>If you are saying that those people don&#39;t have their own culture here in america then that&#39;s pretty offensive.</p>

<p><strong>Forced labor</strong></p>

<p><strong>From the 15th to the 18th century, Irish, English, Scots and Welsh prisoners were transported for forced labor in the Caribbean to work off their term of punishment. Even larger numbers came voluntarily as indentured servants. In the 18th century they were sent to the American colonies, and in the early 19th century to Australia.[22][23] The Irish were dehumanised by the English, described as savages, so making their displacement appear all the more justified.</strong>[24] In 1654 the British parliament gave Oliver Cromwell a free hand to banish Irish &quot;undesirables&quot;. Cromwell rounded up Catholics throughout the Irish countryside and placed them on ships bound for the Caribbean, mainly Barbados. Records suggest that priests may have been routinely tortured and executed. By 1655, 12,000 political prisoners had been forcibly shipped to Barbados.[25]</p>

Black american pride is about culture. The culture black americans have created in america that isn&#39;t part of the status quo american culture.
Mexicans have culture, different Asian races have different culture. But no one says yellow pride.
There&#39;s no other way to label it its gotta be black american pride.
If your white then you celebrate your own culture , if its american culture,irish culture,German,dutch. But white pride doesn&#39;t make sense.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah but if your american why say you have white pride? Its not being proud of your culture or country its being proud in your skin</p>

<p>Black american pride is about culture. The culture black americans have created in america that isn&#39;t part of the status quo american culture.</p>

<p>Mexicans have culture, different Asian races have different culture. But no one says yellow pride.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no other way to label it its gotta be black american pride.</p>

<p>If your white then you celebrate your own culture , if its american culture,irish culture,German,dutch. But white pride doesn&#39;t make sense. For it to make sense its gotta be american pride or caucasion pride. Get it? I&#39;m not against it, it just doesnt make sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep I&#39;ve said like a million times on this thread lol I&#39;m also against culture and in a perfect world people would see culture is just corporation instilling values on a people. I completely understand.</p>

<p>I was just talking about how people shouldn&#39;t complain about this whole white pride\power debacle. </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t make sense.  Alteast use it correctly in context and say caucasion pride or German pride. White pride is weird in response to black american pride</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Black pride is a reference to their culture in america you can&#39;t really label it another way. Black culture exist. We could call it African american pride. But we know people on reddit ( mostly white) think that&#39;s offensive...?.</p>

<p>White pride is only pride in your skin if it was pride for your country then its just patriotism or German pride,Irish pride, French pride</p>

<p>Black american pride is pride in the cultures that has come out of america.  White pride is only describing pride in skin color. </p>

<p>Asian cultures don&#39;t say yellow pride</p>

<p>Black power came out of the black panther age and they did need a slogan like that at the time.</p>

<p>If you are white and wanna have pride say your a patriot or your respective heritage\culture.</p>

<p>It makes more sense to say caucasion pride or European pride. You don&#39;t really get a clear picture with white pride it just sounds offensive.  Here in america black pride comes with a more complete picture you don&#39;t automatically think their rascist as fuck.  </p>

<p>Black pride is hard to label in america. Mexicans don&#39;t usually say brown pride and Asians don&#39;t usually say yellow pride. This is situational</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah but its confusing and its like being proud on having your skin not brown or black. </p>

<p>When people say white pride  confusing. I mean they could mean america but its a shitty way of describing it. Their just telling me they like their white skin.</p>

<p>Black pride comes with a lot more context and tells me they have pride in what their ancestors did in that country and they recognize the atrocities and struggles of their culture in this country.</p>

<p>If you say your a patriot or have american pride then the picture is much clearer.
Its not confusing.</p>

<p>Black pride is an old saying we have come to accept what it means. White power is an old saying we know what it means. White pride is newish and its just confusing.    </p>

<p>I guess the only doubt i have in my arguement which I&#39;m still standing by 100% is can you have black american pride but still be a patriot. Its kinda conflicting.</p>

<p>Its like man your missing the point.  Ugh I didn&#39;t think I would get so much hate for that opinion even getting called rascist by people yelling white power ...wow.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anti-White propaganda?  Nope.  However I was not surprised at all when Black Phil resorted to violence to solve his problems.  And if you&#39;ve seen the season finale, you know Carol wisely chooses White Phil as a partner.  </p>

<p>I even found the show to have some pretty strong Christian messages: Phil (White Phil) prays to God a lot and God answers him maybe not verbally, but definitely with actions.  Carol insists Phil marry her before repopulating so their children aren&#39;t bastards.  And of course, Phil&#39;s selfish attempts to bed Melissa cause him trouble because he lusts after his neighbor&#39;s &quot;wife&quot;  or wife equivalent, whatever.  </p>

<p>I was impressed with some of the positive messages, tbh and that&#39;s why I kept watching it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, Alpha fucks, Beta bucks. She bred with the ethnic phil and took off with white phil for security. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Carol insists Phil marry her before repopulating so their children aren&#39;t bastards.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After which no repopulation occurs and a principle which she quickly eschews for black phil. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Black Phil resorted to violence to solve his problems.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which worked. Weak white kooky alternately religious and agnostic Phil lost his civilization to superior force. White Phil lacked the killer instinct and instead succumbed to superior force and gets to keep his philandering girlfriend who he did not win, but whom granted him her companionship after she answered the Call of the Wild. She got to sow her oats, now Tandy can be granted his desire. Which is to create his civilization. Which now has to be away from his hometown, the town he lived in his entire life, and rebuild elsewhere.</p>

<p>I hope the show never comes back but if it does put me down for Carol having been knocked up by black Phil. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whites waking up is a bigger threat to Jewry&#39;s power than ISIS is. They will make every effort to stigmatize white people even <em>thinking</em> about the interests of their own race.</p>

<p>If ordinary white people care more about their race than they do about signaling how tolerant and not-racist they are, the scheme falls apart. And if people start looking into how things got so bad, well Shlomo&#39;s gonna have some splainin to do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ISIS isn&#39;t a threat at all. They are right on the Syrian border of Israel. They do not attack the Jews. Israel lets them come in and out, giving them medical treatment and supplies. Mossad and CIA made ISIS. They are an arm of the Jewish beast.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude you need to educate yourself to the real truth.  </p>

<p>Do you honestly think European Whites/Caucasians have not been treated to the exact same conditions of slavery, and systemic abuse as blacks?</p>

<p>The story sold to you as &quot;The Great Potato Famine&quot; is one of the biggest lies ever told.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This is just an example of the Irish.  We can go deeper into the Scots, and many other whites that were enslaved and abused by a feudal lord system over centuries as well.</p>

<p>Try educating yourself beyond what the laughably skewed historical record that Jewllywood spoon-feeds Americans</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep I&#39;ve said like a million times on this thread lol I&#39;m also against culture and in a perfect world people would see culture is just corporation instilling values on a people. I completely understand.</p>

<p>I was just talking about how people shouldn&#39;t complain about this whole white pride\power debacle. </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t make sense.  Alteast use it correctly in context and say caucasion pride or German pride. White pride is weird in response to black american pride</p>
