    <div class="md"><p>Ok here we go! First off we are not constantly decelerating, in fact in science there is no such thing as deceleration, there is only acceleration as any change in your velocity or direction is called acceleration. Second the reason we don&#39;t feel the earth moving is due to the fact we are moving with it.</p>

<p>Lastly to tie all this back to the conservation of momentum, there is practically no friction in space, thus the earth and stars ect. are staying at pretty much at a constant velocity. The only acceleration the earth is really going through is change in direction due to orbiting the sun. So no the earth is not constantly &quot;speeding up&quot; or &quot;slowing down&quot; which is what you&#39;re most likely thinking acceleration is.</p>

<p>Lastly gravity itself dispels the notion of a flat earth. Where is the center of mass in a flat earth? What is keeping us to the ground in a flat earth? Sorry my friend, maybe science just isn&#39;t for you</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t claim we are constantly decelerating. If you want to stick with acceleration as a term, let&#39;s do that, and then be very clear that that acceleration is never constant.</p>

<p>In the OP, I listed all the various differing speeds that are claimed by the One Ring mythology. They are vector quantities in three dimensional space and thus our acceleration should be changing all the time. Any time I&#39;m in a vehicle and the acceleration changes slightly I can feel it.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a circular version of gravity. In all mediums, dense objects sink. That&#39;s all that is necessary; the atmosphere is a medium itself (see fluid dynamics). There isn&#39;t a &#39;center of mass&#39; as there doesn&#39;t need to be a ridiculous theory (gravity) to explain why water would stay on a ball.</p>

<p>Why do you think we would just go floating away into the sky if we existed on a rather flat plane instead of a sphere? If you don&#39;t know the answers, the mainstream will basically say &quot;it&#39;s all relative&quot; and point to relativity, a circular reasoning where we just ignore the context and only focus on the &quot;relative&quot; frames of reference i.e. a flat Earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s your mass compared to a cars? What is your mass compared to the earths? Also if you&#39;re going around a circular track never altering your speed it feels completely different if you&#39;re making turns after going straight. You clearly are a troll and you definitely put your all into it. Your whole bit on dense objects sinking in water as proof of gravity for a flat earth makes no sense.

<p>(3959 * 5280 * (1 - cos(x/3959))) replace the x with miles from vantage point and paste the equation into google it will return the drop from vantage point in feet. e.g 1 mile = 8 inches 3 miles =6 feet etc..</p>

<p>There are many videos like the asshole weatherman calling a 2.5 mile drop  or bend in light a mirage a mirage that was just perfect enough to give the illusion of lfat earth, yet somehow we never see this in real life.

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s never been a situation where planes have flown across the country with zero wind. </p>

<p><a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolis_effect">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolis_effect</a></p>

<p>Planes are contained as a motion within the earth, just because they&#39;re 1000 feet off the ground doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re suddenly not a part of earth anymore. </p>

<p>The earth&#39;s rotation still does have a effect on flight paths, but it&#39;s a &#39;horizontal&#39; effect, which means they might have to point the plane a degree to the right or left (depending on which hemisphere you&#39;re in) of their intended target to compensate. This really only maybe applies to the longest flights (both by time or distance) and even then isn&#39;t exactly anything major or even worth mentioning. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Two planes flying across the usa in separate directions wouldn&#39;t take the same amount of time to finish. There are many reasons for this, including the jetstream. If you wish to understand how the rotation of the Earth has little discernible effect on the times, however, all you have to understand is that both planes are embedded in the same, moving matrix. The plane facing west on the ground is moving backwards at &quot;1000 mph&quot; and the plane facing East is moving forward at &quot;1000 mph&quot;, the ground is moving at &quot;1000mph&quot;, the atmosphere is moving at 1000mph&quot; (plus/minus local windspeeds). The effect is not zero, but close enough, as local wind is a bigger factor.</p>

<p>Lol at your idea that because it works slightly differently at the north or south poles that somehow invalidates the entire thing, when that just further proves it.

    <div class="md"><p>Dude like whatever about everything else but you really just don&#39;t seem right to me. </p>

<p>I&#39;m with you, we&#39;re lied to about a lot of things. Our political system is beyond corrupt in every phase of it&#39;s existence. People are lied too and manipulated constantly to fit particular agendas whether it&#39;s to gain control or make money. </p>

<p>But a few of the things we aren&#39;t being lied too about is going to the moon. Or gravity. Or that the earth is a globe spinning through space. Or that the south pole exists. I&#39;ve been to a lot of places in the world, not quite to the south pole but pretty close to it. Saying shit like that doesn&#39;t exist is absolutely crazy talk. Do you think Europe doesn&#39;t exist? Is Australia a myth? When I get in a plane and go somewhere is it just some kind of trick/simulation that TPTB is playing on me?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>So are you really don&#39;t believe in gravity? You claim you understand these things but I really don&#39;t think you do. You cry about how it&#39;s all just sources and it&#39;s nothing that you or I could prove ourselves and that&#39;s just not true. Do you also think our entire mathematical understanding and system is entirely bullshit? Another one of our master&#39;s lies? The math behind the Foucault Pendulum works out. I was playing with toy rockets from hobby lobby when I was 12 and doing that certainly &#39;proves&#39; stuff like gravity and the basic concepts of physics to me. </p>

<p>All your posts and everything in this thread has just been angry ranting denying things that are easily provable yourself. You&#39;ve denied denied and denied every shred of any kind of evidence or logic that doesn&#39;t line up with your own twisted line of thinking. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to argue with you anymore. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re here just to try and discredit the whole institution, or if you really believe the shit you&#39;re spewing. Regardless it&#39;s beyond ridiculous and I hope that you &#39;wake up&#39; from this kind of delusion and focus on real problems eventually. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You mean see? Oh yeah but I never see a city overlay Ina such a perfect manner in Chicago to bend light the perfect amount as to make it seem like a flat surface bending light 2.5 miles upward and around. It also affects Cuba too which would be a mile under the horizon and somehow over warm water versus weatherman stating cold water. It&#39;s all just perfect mirages, but only over water never over land yeah that seems legit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah the horizon rises to your level and on any ball no matter how large the ball is the horizon would drop below eye level. The windows are bowed in the plane which can give the illusion of a curve. There is no curve there are thousands of horizon pictures to google and measure with a ruler.</p>
