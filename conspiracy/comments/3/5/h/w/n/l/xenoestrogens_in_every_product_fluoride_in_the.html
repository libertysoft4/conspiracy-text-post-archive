        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>You&#39;re the livestock of a worldwide tax farm implemented by the coordinated efforts of non-governmental private central banks. Stumbled on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> by mistake? The rabbit hole goes deeper than you think.</p>

<p>You start with 9/11 and all of your research tears apart the official story and your faith in your government and media. If you&#39;re diligent with your investigations, you will have found out about the $240 billion worth of bonds that came due on 9/12/2001, how the Securities and Exchange Commission declared a national emergency and for the first time in U.S. history invoked its emergency powers to clear those bonds privately.</p>

<p>This would send you off investigating the Federal Reserve and its role in American history, where you learn that it was planned in secret, is neither federal nor a reserve, and architected America&#39;s transition from a gold backed dollar to a faith based Federal Reserve Note now held as a global currency due to oil dependency. Why didn&#39;t you ever learn about any of this in the government indoctrination centers where you spent 12 years being behaviorally trained to be an obedient consumer? If you keep digging you&#39;ll find that the entire income tax and IRS are unconstitutional, not ratified by all the states, and the lifeblood of the parasitic Federal Reserve.</p>

<p>And globalists have franchised out this scheme to almost every other nation. Private central banks control the currencies and thus override any policy decisions from governments that are no longer sovereign. International schemes such as the BIS and the IMF are used by those who already control the biggest numbers in the money game to take ownership of the national resources while placing enormous debt burdens on the citizens of entire countries.</p>

<p>It really is a fight of the 99% against the 1%. It&#39;s even closer to 99.9% vs the 0.1%, and we still can&#39;t unite. Because we&#39;ve been factory farmed humans our entire lives, and there has been a sustained chemical assault on you from every direction.</p>

<p>The truth goes even deeper than this, but it&#39;s too painful to face for most just yet. You will find that &quot;globalists&quot; really is the best term for describing <strong>all</strong> who control this tax farm, much better than &quot;elites&quot; or &quot;TPTB&quot; or &quot;ZOG&quot;.</p>

<p>EDIT: I&#39;ve been shadowbanned because once I was linked to by <a href="/r/subredditdrama">/r/subredditdrama</a> and <a href="/r/topmindsofreddit">/r/topmindsofreddit</a> all of my posts were downvoted to oblivion. Flat Earth is the mother of all conspiracies and real discussion of it is censored on reddit, look into it yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post. </p>

<p>On a metaphysical level, I believe we manifested this parasite class because too many people refuse to take responsibility for themselves. I&#39;m by no means trying to justify globalism, but people need to understand that there is much more to life than going to your 9-5 and watching Netflix. If you decide to check out, it screws over everyone else. There is an epic fucking Lord of the Rings type battle happening on this planet, and most people aren&#39;t even aware of it. </p>

<p>That said, it&#39;s a vicious cycle, because the system tries to fuck you over from birth (unless you&#39;re born into an extremely elite family.) We gotta wake people up. Life is so crazy, man, but I&#39;m loving it. Every day is kind of an adventure when you start unplugging and taking full responsibility for yourself. </p>
