        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have something extremely urgent to tell you all</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been hearing voices for about a year now. I was diagnosed with psychosis in November, but the voices do seem to be real people. They know things I do not know, they feel, and at times I hear them talk with themselves, as if having a conversation. </p>

<p>Evidence they&#39;re real people:
-They give up names I have never heard before - Shatokhina, Madsen, Rognhilde and Helene and Simon Rosvik
-They know things I do not know, therefore they cannot simply be echoes in the hearing centre, as I have been taught by my treater. For example, they know alot about Christianity and different mythology, which they&#39;ve been using to fool me.
-They constantly want me to give up my, my mum and my dad‘s password. They say they&#39;ve stolen money from my mum, without her knowing.
-They hypnotise me.</p>

<p>This is what I have know out about them; they&#39;re swindlers. Using radiowaves, they can contact people‘s thoughts. I do not know how. Then, they manipulate people like me to give up the password. They say they&#39;re working under the Free Masons. They also have a tendency to &quot;try&quot; to predict the future.</p>

<p>Please spread the word. If I am found ina
My real name is Daniel. I live in Oslo, Norway. I love my life, and I love my mum, and my dad. They&#39;ve threatened to steal money. They say they work in a group of 15 people, and that they are a part of the information pyramid like structure you&#39;ve been speaking of.</p>

<p>Please believe me.</p>

OP, if you are real: get a few rolls of aluminum foil, wallpaper your bed room or wherever/whenever this shit occurs most frequently (more info would be nice), ground it by electrically connecting it to the copper pipes of the radiator. </p>

<p>Or indeed go caving in some deep underground caves, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Caves_of_Norway">Norway should have a few of them</a>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. Those voices are in your head. How do you know what they are telling you isn&#39;t just invented from pieces of information you have heard   </p>

<p>Have you told a therapist about what they are saying?</p>

<p>There are subs who can help, they have first hand experience of voices </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely. Its not a thought to someone with schizophrenia, it&#39;s a set in stone fact. When I was having delusions I didn&#39;t think people were out to get me. I knew it. The voices are real. The sudden onset of &quot;new&quot; voices is something I can attest to. For most of my life the voices were all my own, but when the delusions got really bad they sounded like new people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi Wooyey. Sounds like you&#39;ve got quite a problem here. I also have a mental diagnosis and I&#39;ve been living with it for several years now - not much fun there. I&#39;d like to chip in my 2 cents.</p>

<p>One thing about the voices is that they can know stuff from your subconscious, because they themselves come from there - for instance: three years ago you saw a name on a newspaper but just scanned past it to other articles and didn&#39;t pay much attention to it. It was stored in your subconscious (I read somewhere that like 95% of the information the brain processes happens there). Now, if you were to develop a mental problem that causes the voices, they have access to that stored information that your conscious self does not. I know this from experience.</p>

<p>I hope you get through this crisis. Be well!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP, please seek medical help. Hearing voices isn&#39;t any cause for concern by itself, but if it&#39;s bothering you then speak to a doctor and ask about options like therapy and yes, medication. This honestly isn&#39;t the best sub to be posting this on, try <a href="/r/schizophrenia">/r/schizophrenia</a>. Then make an appointment or even go to Accident and Emergency. If it is schizophrenia, it is likely very treatable if you begin treatment as early as possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To the Greeks these were &quot;Daemons&quot;, that is beings between the gods and humans. The Arabs called them Djinn. Their voices were a mix. They might be enlightening or they might be misleading tricksters.</p>

<p>Christian Europe just took the negatives out of the mix, (of course) and called them Demons. </p>

<p>Daemons and Djinn were very common in ancient times, a part of the life of the people. </p>

<p>As a Jungian I would guess that that was because people in ancient times lived more  in their subconscious minds than in their conscious minds, where they were more vulnerable to the voices of the collective unconscious even during waking hours. </p>

<p>From a Jungian perspective, whether the voices are &quot;real&quot; or not is secondary. Psychologically, to you they are. For Jung I believe that these voices are symptoms that your conscious mind is being overcome by unconscious content, his definition of madness.</p>

<p>So I too would recommend finding a good therapist who would help you with exercises, or if need be medicines that would help you to quiet your dream life which is overcoming your normal daily life, quiet the voices and send them back to where they came from.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was my understanding that OP didn&#39;t ask about exorcists, the religion posts were made by others posting their suggestion. The voices are there, and silencing them using medication manufactured by a government trying to control its citizens might not be in OP&#39;s best interests. Neither is an exorcist, but turning to drugs off the bat is not the correct approach, as those drugs can not be trusted to do what they say they do. </p>

<p>I know I sound paranoid and crazy (rest assured I am not), but this is how diligent we need to be in order to notice and fight against governmental overreach. People are far too comfortable to claim that they are free.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry if I came off as a dick as well.</p>

<p>I&#39;m honestly torn lately about the mandatory vaccinations. On one hand it makes perfect sense. On the other, it gives the government a perfect cover story...and if anyone doesn&#39;t want to get vaccinated and they die, then its entirely that person&#39;s fault. However, its key to remember that while the vaccination may indeed save lives, it may also contain other stuff that the public has no chance to scrutinize, and so they are unaware of it. </p>

<p>Its a very tricky situation with the school shootings...they are definitely anomalies, as in this is not a commonly-occurring event. There is evidence that Sandy Hook was a false flag operation, but I don&#39;t want to get into this discussion because of all the people that can&#39;t see past the actual event and consider that. </p>

<p>All it really comes down to is how open one&#39;s mind is to the unknown and the hidden, and how they handle that perspective. Meditation is primarily used for centering your focus and expanding your way of thinking to include &quot;fringe sciences&quot; and other non-publicized pgenomena, which is why I believe OP should at least practice meditation to see if they notice any progress or clarification. Hell, they could even use meditation to try and talk back to the voices, if OP isn&#39;t already doing so.</p>

<p>You may be right, it could just be a medical issue, so I agree that OP should at least see a doctor and get their opinion. If they force a prescription, OP can always hold off on taking the meds, but at least he&#39;ll have them to fall back on. You raised a good point...the US over prescribes medication compared to other countries.</p>

<p>The voices don&#39;t appear to have ET origins, but in any case, Google &quot;Pleiadean message&quot; and you should find a few instances of a message that is begging humanity to &quot;wake up&quot;, and recognize that life isn&#39;t as simple or as clear-cut as the world governments would have us believe. Under the current system, governments profits and citizens gain comforts...but that isn&#39;t life, that&#39;s essentially slavery. There are many people - the majority, even - that will fight tooth and nail to hold on to their simple and easy-to-understand view of the world. These are the people that need our help the most. </p>

<p>TL;DR: There is definitely something going on behind the scenes, it&#39;s just a matter of who&#39;s open to hearing the evidence and also willing to consider that evidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t like big pharma as much as you but when my aunt thought her doctor and &quot;the monster&quot; were living in her attic she refused to leave her house. She could hear them plotting against her and lost her well paying corporate job and insurance. She has since gone on meds but spent so much time untreated she will never be the same or get her teeth back. Not to mention she works 3rd shift at a gas station, a big transition from the woman she used to be. I love fringe things and want to always hold out hope that there is &quot;something else&quot; going on, but don&#39;t let it override common sense, something that is easy to do with psychosis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP, try practicing meditation. The more you can focus and feel the energy around you, the more you might be able to distinguish between internal voices (we all have those), and externally produced voices.</p>

<p>Not saying it&#39;ll work, but it&#39;s worth a shot before turning to Big Pharma to solve this dilemma.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You might be crazy... that&#39;s a possibility, but I know of three ways you get voices without being crazy. 2 are purposeful and one has to do with the materials they use and the lengths of the pins for dental work.</p>

<p>If you are hearing actual voices via purposeful technology (ssss) they require bouncing a radio signal off of some part of the head... either the ear cavity or a portion of the brain.</p>

<p>Look up SSSS to find out about it, and as silly as this sounds, a tin foil hat is your cheapest Faraday cage. I knew someone that used a tin foil hat for a while until he got some dental work done. He was picking up a radio station or a CB or a Ham Radio and it was driving him mad. Any size of regular metal will pick up radio waves based on its length, and the pins in dental fillings are centimeter length, so they&#39;re going to pick up centimeter band radio.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The woo troll strikes again!  Why they do it, no one knows...except for some who say their life is empty. Companionless.  Comfortless. Some have said that they have a mental illness and make fun of the disabled because they hate it in themselves.  Maybe this one just really wants his mama.  Will we ever grasp the motivation of this compulsion? Not many care to, and who can blame them.  Whether a perfect stranger or his own shadow, they get their lulz where they can find them, in places only the desperate care to look.</p>

<p>The woo troll.  Misanthropic bore fest.  Imbecilic grumbler. Master justifier.  Tediously commonplace.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Listen, your rational mind is very powerful. Remember when you are experiencing these auditory hallucinations that there is simply no rational motive for people to be &quot;messing with you&quot;. People with the kind of technology you might imagine are creating these voices would have no need to get your passwords. </p>

<p>Take care of yourself, eat healthier, get lots of exercise. Learn to meditate. you will have better control over your mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>as a schizo myself: my rational mind could not overcome my delusions/hallucinations en it only went away wid medication. even when i realized i was in a mental hospital en had a mental problem (en i was just my unimportant self en not actually god) i still believed de voices were actual peopel. dey were helping me get well by monitoring my thoughts wid technology. making sure i wouldnt turn into a pedo because of de medication which i &quot;remembered reading&quot; could turn you into one. i was psychotic for something like a year en a half. at de point i was hearing voices i was just tripping balls all day long. dere is no diet, exercise or rational entity to stop dat from happening. its a neurochemical problem wid a chemical solution. </p>

Second pray for them.

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely. Its not a thought to someone with schizophrenia, it&#39;s a set in stone fact. When I was having delusions I didn&#39;t think people were out to get me. I knew it. The voices are real. The sudden onset of &quot;new&quot; voices is something I can attest to. For most of my life the voices were all my own, but when the delusions got really bad they sounded like new people. </p>
