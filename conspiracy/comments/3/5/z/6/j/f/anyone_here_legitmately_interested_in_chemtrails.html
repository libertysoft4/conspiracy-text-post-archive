I can post pictures all day long for those of you interested. Ill start it off now. This was from the other day, and is a daily occurrence over here..</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/eBQ9Omz.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/eBQ9Omz.jpg</a></p>

<p>Whether they continue in the same path, or turn around and come back, the sprayer stays on and you can tell right away it isnt commercial. Or you can cheat and check out flightradar24.com to match with whats in the sky.</p>

<p>I dont want anyone to reply saying, &#39;well some planes dont show up on flghtradar24.com because they dont have to register&#39;, because thats impossible. In order to be a body with two wings in the sky, you must register with the FAA.</p>

<p>I realize there are some planes that dont come equipped with the tracking systems new planes have(which would render flightradar24.com useless), but none of those planes exist for commercial use anymore.</p>

<p>Lets share!</p>

<p>Let the storm roll.</p>

<p>Edit: All info pertaining to the topic is much appreciated!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Use that tracker I referenced. It works very well. It will tell you that its commercial, and give you the flight number of that current trip. If you look up and see what you think is a sprayer, get on and check out whats in the air above you. </p>

<p>Many times have I looked up, got onto flightradar24.com and there wont be a flight for miles around me. It just simply happens. Its hard to hide everything from the general public.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We see the chemtrail gridwork of lines most days in this part of central Texas, I finally convinced my brother and father that they are not just contrails/water vapor. I asked them to watch the sky for a few moonlit nights and tell my if they ever see the long straight lines or gridwork of &quot;contrails&quot; that we constantly see all through the day. After a while they had to admit that they never saw them at night- you&#39;d think that water vapor cooling into contrails would still occur at night and maybe even at a higher rate since average temperatures are lower and humidity higher at night.<br/>
TLDR: Whatever they are spraying has a relationship to sunlight- you never see chemtrails at night- just contrails and clouds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It could go either way. Honestly, I&#39;m glad some of us can meet at a common ground. I do know that you are correct though about not seeing as much traffic at night. You can however clearly see trails when there is a full(or close to full) moon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>AnonUSCiti, it would be my guess that you&#39;re just not using FlightRadar24 correctly.  People tend to under-estimate how far away planes are, and assume that they must be flying right over their position if they are visible. How about posting a picture of a plane leaving a trail, and telling us the time, approximate location, and direction in which the photo was taken, and we&#39;ll see if we can locate a likely flight in FR24.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Understandable. But putting 2 and 2 together is very easy for a person like me. I dont just connect one point with another. More thought goes into it. I narrow it down to if there is any traffic in the area. </p>

<p>Lets say I see a plane that looks like is 5-6 miles away in the distance. I check up on flight radar and look to see if there are even any planes in the northstate within 50 miles of me. If there are, its time to take out the augmented reality or telescope. I dont know, for someone like me, I have the resources to not be stupid about my findings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not saying in any way that you could be wrong but I know of the exsistance of cloud seeding to produce rain clouds. Ionized silver released into the upper atmosphere combines with heavier water particles to produce rain. As we all know rain is what CA needs these days.

<p>About noon ; They start spreading wide and hazing over.</p>

<p>By 6pm ; You can tell they havent gone away and they stretch for miles, still not dissipating. The day goes from a clear blue sky(with trails throughout) to a light mist over the top of us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Weather modification (cloud seeding) is a real thing, and it&#39;s not secret.  But it doesn&#39;t cause those persistent cloud trails across the sky.  It involves the release of materials into existing clouds, to induce or enhance precipitation.  It&#39;s not the same thing as geoengineering.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re being downvoted. One of the current theories is that they are cloud seeding over the pacific so rain doesn&#39;t make it to california. In addition to making sure there is less snowfall during the winter, which can also be accomplished by cloud seeding. </p>

<p>And before anyone says &quot;why would they want a drought in california&quot; it&#39;s so they can kill off all the heritage crops/trees and a big agritech company/companies can come in an buy up all the land. It&#39;s all about control. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im being downvoted because people have no clue as to what is really happening in Cali. And other parts of the counrty. </p>

<p>You cant tell me all of a sudden California  is in a drought.... its sad that people are ignorant to the fact this is happening and its a direct result of the chemtrails/ cloud seeding. </p>

<p>People just want to burry their head in the sand and just let life pass them by while playing mind craft and wow. 
All it takes is a quick google search to understand what chemtrails are, but, again that would mean actually doing something aside from their nonexistent life.....you see...until something directly affects someone... they will continue to eat  their cheetos, drink their grape soda while trying to get to the next level of whatever mind sucking game they are playing.</p>
