        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The London and Northwestern Railway forms a straight line 180 miles long between London and Liverpool. The railroad&#39;s highest point, midway at Birmingham station, is only 240 feet above sea-level. If the world were actually a globe, however, curveting 8 inches per mile squared, the 180 mile stretch of rail would form an arc with the center point at Birmingham raising a full 5,400 feet above London and Liverpool. Adding the station&#39;s actual height (240 feet) to its theoretical inclination (5,400 feet) gives 5,640 feet as the rail&#39;s necessary height on a globe Earth, more than a thousand feet taller than Ben Nevis, the tallest mountain in Great Britain.</p>

<p>The Suez Canal which connects the Mediterranean Sea with the Gulf of Suez on the Red Sea is a clear proof of the Earth&#39;s and water&#39;s non-convexity. The canal is 100 miles long and without any locks so the water within is an uninterrupted continuation of the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea. When it was constructed, the Earth&#39;s supposed curvature was not taken into account, it was dug along a horizontal datum line 26 feet below sea-level, passing through several lakes from one sea to the other, with the datum line and the water&#39;s surface running perfectly parallel over the 100 miles. The average level of the Mediterranean is 6 inches above the Red Sea, while the floodtides in the Red Sea rise 4 feet above the highest and drop 3 feet below the lowest in the Mediterranean, making the half-tide level of the Red Sea, the surface of the Mediterranean Sea, and the 100 miles of water in the canal, all a clear continuation of the same horizontal line! Were they instead the supposed curved line of globe-Earthers, the water in the center of the canal would be 1666 feet (50<sup>2</sup> x 8 inches = 1666 feet 8 inches) above the respective Seas on either side!</p>

<p>If you&#39;re interested in more proofs in this direction, check out Eric Dubay&#39;s &quot;The Flat-Earth Conspiracy&quot; or one of his many youtube videos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, that&#39;s my point... &quot;people who understand how levels work&quot;.</p>

<p>A level will never indicate curvature... until the tool itself is long enough (assuming it&#39;s actually straight) that one end would be &quot;up&quot; while the other is flat. Then it&#39;s not the bubble but the length and straightness of the tool showing you curvature. This assumes you can find a place in which terrain doesn&#39;t skew your results.</p>

<p>Ah, flat-earthers. So fun.</p>

<p>&quot;I demand evidence, but any evidence you show me I&#39;ll discount offhand as liars.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It must be obvious to the reader that, if the earth be the globe of popular belief, the rules observed for navigating a vessel from one part of this globe to another, must be in conformity to its figure. The datum line in navigation would be an arc of a circle, and all computations would be based on the convexity of water and worked out by spherical trigonometry. <strong>Let me preface my remarks on the important branch of our subject by stating that at sea the datum line is always a horizontal line; spherical trigonometry is never used, and not one out of one thousand shipmasters understands spherical trigonometry</strong>.&quot; -Thomas Winship, &quot;Zetetic Cosmogeny&quot;</p>

<p>a) send a balloon with a camera up to at least 90,000 ft.
b) charter a flight from somewhere in the southern hemisphere, across the south pole, and report back where he ends up.
c) learn how to do math so he can correctly speak about the curvature of the earth in real numbers and not obviously inflated numbers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;d have to ask the flat-earthers that question.</p>

<p>EDIT: Wait, I think I can answer this now.</p>

<p>Some people must be incapable of comprehending anything beyond their own personal experiences. I mean, sitting here, looking out my window, the ground absolutely looks flat. Everywhere I&#39;ve ever been, it&#39;s been the same. I&#39;ve even looked out over the Great Lakes and a few oceans, but I never actually saw a curvature (nor did I ever specifically watch a ship sailing away or such).</p>

<p>If I were incapable of considering science, reproducible experiments, videos, photographs, and math that someone else did or made, I think it might be pretty hard to convince me that my own experiences were inaccurate.</p>

<p>Telescopes with significant magnification capabilities that are capable of capturing the infrared spectrum exist.</p>

<p>If the planet is flat lika you head (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBv3_0j0y_4">reference</a>), I should be able to set such a telescope up on a tall building on the US East Coast and see Portugal clearly, right? If not, please explain why.</p>

<p>How about you attempt to refute a single thing I said in my original reply to you?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Brohammer, there is proof all over the world and Internet that the Earth is a rough sphere.</p>

<p>You&#39;re the one in here railing against all reason and evidence that it&#39;s not the case.</p>

<p>I proposed an experiment that would absolutely enable you to prove your point. That&#39;s how science works. We come up with a supposition / theory (the earth is flat), then we come up with predictions based on that theory (I should be able to see infrared light across the ocean), then we set up experiments to determine whether those predictions were accurate.</p>

<p>When people who support flat earth decry the simplest, most basic of experiments like you did, it should tell not only us, but <em>them</em> something.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t want to fly to another country (I don&#39;t know where you&#39;re from), you don&#39;t have to. All you need to do is get to a large enough body of water that the coastline on the other side would be well behind the horizon on a spherical earth, set up the experiment, and see what you see.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s some information about the horizon:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For an observer on the ground with eye level at h = 5 ft 7 in (1.70 m), the horizon is at a distance of 2.9 miles (4.7 km). For an observer standing on a hill or tower 100 feet (30 m) in height, the horizon is at a distance of 12.2 miles (19.6 km).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You don&#39;t even need that big a body of water. 30-50 miles across ought to be plenty, assuming you&#39;re avoiding tall features on either coast.</p>

<p>So a compass would still face north (towards the middle) and you could still go around the world and come back to where you started but you have to do that east to west. North to south is not possible.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not exactly a flat earth believer, but it is interesting that north-south circumnavigation is such a rare thing in human history. (not sure it&#39;s ever been recorded) This on top of the heavy military presence at the north pole really feeds into the flat earth idea.</p>

<p>To this point, I figured it would have been done because humans tend to want to do really stupid, dangerous stuff just so they can say they did. If I remember it&#39;s been done but has never been recorded and is exceptionally rare because of the reason you mentioned and because it&#39;s a very harsh climate.</p>

<p>I find myself fascinated by the flat earth stuff because there are so many nuggets out there that seem interesting. To me it all doesn&#39;t add up to the earth being flat, but I feel like they&#39;re touching on something that&#39;s hidden. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sadly I&#39;m more likely to get the one about the ships. As to the point OP is trying to make, everything we build is made with pieces that are less than 100 ft. long because of transporting them. It is therefore unnecessary to consider the curvature of the earth when constructing things. If we made things with pieces that were thousands of feet long  and had to be critically precise, it might make a difference. To make his case a bit stronger he might  could find something in surveying large distances. Unfortunately he doesn&#39;t actually have reality on his side.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anyone can prove the sea-horizon perfectly straight and the entire Earth perfectly flat using nothing more than a level, tripods, and a wooden plank. At any altitude above sea-level, simply fix a 6-12 foot long, smooth, leveled board edgewise upon tripods and observe the skyline from eye-level behind it. The distant horizon will always align perfectly parallel with the upper edge of the board. Furthermore, if you move in a half-circle from one end of the board to the other while observing the skyline over the upper edge, you will be able to tracle a clear, flat 10-20 miles depending on your altitude. This would be impossible if the Earth were a globe and the surface of water convex! If the Earth were actually a globe 25,000 miles in circumference, the horizon would align over the center of the board but then gradually, noticeably decline towards the extremities. Just ten miles on each side would necessitate an easily visible curvature of 66.6 feet from each end to the center.</p>

<p>From Concorde flying trans-Atlantic at 60K feet, the horizon is imperceptible on the south side (towards the equator) and quite pronounced towards the North Pole. Really an amazing difference between the 2 views. The most surprising aspect of the Concorde is the very smooth ride (no turbulence at flight level 600) and the lack of any sensation of speed (really the only exciting part is the takeoff, particularly at JFK where they used that great delta wing for some unique noise abatement flying).</p>

<p>All we can see from Earth are globs of light, nothing else. It is impossible to claim that they are balls because we don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>The topic of this thread is a fact, one you can&#39;t address, while you try to marginalize me. <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/35anzr/the_statue_of_liberty_in_new_york_stands_326_feet/">Here</a> is another fact.</p>

<p>Every other object in the universe that is as large or close to as large as the earth is a ball.  Rotation can be directly observed on some due to the fact that we know how long their days are.</p>

<p>The earth is a ball Galileo.</p>

<p>There is no physical evidence for this at all. Independently verifiable and reproducible amateur observations only show globs of light when looking at objects in the night sky. That is the extent of any actual evidence that we have for &quot;every other object in the universe&quot;.</p>

<p>How about you attempt to refute a single thing I said in my original reply to you?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Brohammer, there is proof all over the world and Internet that the Earth is a rough sphere.</p>

<p>You&#39;re the one in here railing against all reason and evidence that it&#39;s not the case.</p>

<p>I proposed an experiment that would absolutely enable you to prove your point. That&#39;s how science works. We come up with a supposition / theory (the earth is flat), then we come up with predictions based on that theory (I should be able to see infrared light across the ocean), then we set up experiments to determine whether those predictions were accurate.</p>

<p>When people who support flat earth decry the simplest, most basic of experiments like you did, it should tell not only us, but <em>them</em> something.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t want to fly to another country (I don&#39;t know where you&#39;re from), you don&#39;t have to. All you need to do is get to a large enough body of water that the coastline on the other side would be well behind the horizon on a spherical earth, set up the experiment, and see what you see.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s some information about the horizon:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For an observer on the ground with eye level at h = 5 ft 7 in (1.70 m), the horizon is at a distance of 2.9 miles (4.7 km). For an observer standing on a hill or tower 100 feet (30 m) in height, the horizon is at a distance of 12.2 miles (19.6 km).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You don&#39;t even need that big a body of water. 30-50 miles across ought to be plenty, assuming you&#39;re avoiding tall features on either coast.</p>
