<p>............................</p>

<p>The famous photo of Buzz Aldrin standing in the spotlight is a giveaway in that he is being lit up in a spotlight from alleged sunlight while the ground around him is shrouded in darkness! How can the sun put a spotlight around a particular person like a stagehand pointing a spotlight on an actor or singer on stage?! This was obviously a major screw up, and NASA was reckless for thinking that no one would notice or that they could get away with it. In fact, it was such a blunder that NASA even tried to cover it up by brightening the rest of the surface in subsequent versions of it. Why would they do that if they had nothing to hide?</p>

<p>Here is the original version of it by NASA, which was released to newspapers in 1969: </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://grin.hq.nasa.gov/IMAGES/SMALL/GPN-2001-000013.jpg">http://grin.hq.nasa.gov/IMAGES/SMALL/GPN-2001-000013.jpg</a></strong></p>

<p>Here is the edited version with the surface brightened up for the Lunar Surface Journal to hide the discrepancy: </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/AS11-40-5903HR.jpg">http://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/AS11-40-5903HR.jpg</a></strong></p>

<p>Apollo defenders can&#39;t explain this at all, so they&#39;ve resorted to deception by claiming that the edited version is the original. But Jarrah White proved unequivocally that the spotlight version is the original one by showing newspaper clippings from 1969 which showed that one in his YouTube video &quot;Moonfaker: Posing for Portrait&quot;. So again, why would NASA alter the photos if they had nothing to hide?</p>

<p><strong>Okay, so I decided to try an experiment. I am going to do a reverse image search with each image and see the results.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>The evidence is a joke. Here, let me save us both time:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>&quot;We can shoot laser at reflectors!&quot;</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Yeah, and since reflectors were dropped by unmanned Soviet mission, <strong>this proves NOTHING</strong> about manned travel to the Moon.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>&quot;Moon rocks! They brought them back guise!&quot;</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Moon rocks are not only found on the moon, they are all over Earth as well. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_rock">Lunar meteorites that fall to Earth.</a> So &quot;moon rocks&quot; <strong>prove NOTHING.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>&quot;But 600 millions people watched it on TV!&quot;</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>600 million people watched a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy. TV stations literally had to point their cameras at a projector screen because NASA didn&#39;t allow them to use the live feed.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>&quot;Some guy on Youtube told me that it was easier to go to the Moon than to fake going to the Moon! And that went viral so it must be true!&quot;</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>This argument is so flawed it is laughable. Since the difficulty of going to moon is only a known variable in the case that we actually went, we can hardly use that logic to answer the question of whether we went or not. So that argument boils down to: <strong>&quot;Since we went to the moon and know how easy it was, that proves that it was easier to go there than to fake going there&quot;. Holy shit, what????</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>What about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Lunar_Surface_Experiments_Package">myriad other scientific experiments</a> that were performed on the moon by subsequent Apollo missions?</p>

<p>If NASA wanted to fake a successful moon landing, why did they bother to fake several more missions as well as the dramatic failure of the Apollo 13 misson?</p>

<p>NTM the Apollo 13 lander was deliberately crashed into the moon so that seismographic equipment left by previous missions could measure the resulting vibrations in the lunar body, all of which was transmitted to earth via radio communications equipment.</p>

<p>What about the fact that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-party_evidence_for_Apollo_Moon_landings#SELENE_photographs">lunar terrain contours</a> at the landing site perfectly match the measurements taken by the Japanese SELENE orbiter? Before the modern orbiting survey equipment, did the US possess detailed terrain maps that were accurate to the tens of meters that could have been used to design a backdrop that <em>precisely</em> matched the geographic features of the area?</p>

<p>What about the fact that Soviet radar installations were capable of monitoring the radio traffic to and from mission control, signals that could easily be triangulated and the exact positions of origin ascertained? </p>

<p>What about <a href="http://mythphile.hubpages.com/hub/apollo-moon-landing-photos-from-space">areal photographs of the landing sites</a> being taken by SELENE, showing clearly the equipment and tire tracks left behind by the Apollo missions?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to be debunkery, but the best &quot;evidence&quot; for the moon landing being a hoax doesn&#39;t seem to be conclusive of anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t understand, astronauts conducting experiments on the moon does not prove that they were really there. It just becomes a small lie meant to corroborate the much bigger one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What about the fact that [2] lunar terrain contours at the landing site perfectly match the measurements taken by the Japanese SELENE orbiter?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If this can be trusted. In the case of the Apollo missions being faked, the implications of Russia not calling us out would imply that a powerful group of people run the world and borders are a fabrications. How hard would it be for Japan to fudge the data to make it corroborate with the moon terrain in the NASA photos. Its not like a double-blind test, they could have easily looked at the NASA photos beforehand and entered the data to make it match.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What about the fact that Soviet radar installations were capable of monitoring the radio traffic to and from mission control, signals that could easily be triangulated and the exact positions of origin ascertained? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once again, I do not believe that Russia not calling us out is proof that we went to the moon. I do not think facts work like that. &quot;Its true because nobody important said that it was a lie&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What about [3] areal photographs of the landing sites being taken by SELENE, showing clearly the equipment and tire tracks left behind by the Apollo missions?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our definition of &quot;clearly&quot; is very different. I see blobs on a shitty photos. Nothing clear or definable at all. Also, certainly not bulletproof evidence of anything.</p>

<p>................</p>

<p>I am not trying to be a dick or anything, I am just concerned that all of the REAL, definitive data, photos, and proof has disappeared. Couple this anomaly with the fact that we haven&#39;t left LEO in human history, except for the Apollo missions. Now add all of the sketchiness and inconsistencies that even 10 minutes of research turn up. </p>

<p>It is really hard for me to 100% believe that it happened under those circumstances. And I definitely do not 100% believe it was faked either. Actually, I am probably like 40% sure it was fake and 60% sure that we went but are not being told the whole story. </p>

<p>What concerns me is the reaction that I get from the general public when the subject is brought up. It is not an intelligent reaction. It is not an educated reaction. It is a very emotional response and 90% of the &quot;proof&quot; that they parrot is not proof at all. Not REAL proof. Real proof doesn&#39;t require a thousand rationales mixed with blind nationalism and hatred for anyone who <em>dares</em> to question the event.</p>

<p>There is zero evidence that we were or are capable of going to the moon, it has all been &quot;lost&quot; or destroyed.</p>

<p>According to people in the space industry today, we are likely 100+ years away from being able to achieve what the Apollo program claimed to have done, it has almost been 50 years already and still no one has any idea how we got on the moon.</p>

We might be able to do it now if we carefully analyzed the &quot;echo&quot; of billions of laser pulses to deal with that sort of signal/noise ratio (this is because lasers become scattered at these ranges, so light would have a much shorter round trip from some routes, and a much larger round trip from others not to mention ground scatter, hills, craters, etc.), but the computers then would have had a hard time with that sort of large scale data processing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I mentioned in the previous post, the problem isn&#39;t the ability to reflect, it&#39;s the signal-noise ratio. Look at any pictures of the lunar surface (event those taken from the ground). You&#39;ll notice the high levels of ground scatter, mountains, hills, differences in albedo. This wouldn&#39;t be a problem if the laser stayed together, but the beam diverges considerably over those ranges. Rather inaccurate observations were previously taken by Russian observers  before the rangefinders were installed, but the inaccuracy of the measurements made many of the current measurements impossible. There is an incredible amount of evidence for the Apollo program at every step I have examined. I just can&#39;t nail down a set of goalposts in these arguments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You provided evidence of one small detail of one small aspect. </p>

<p>Let me break down what you presented:</p>

<p>&quot;We know that the lunar rocks came from the moon because moon rocks from the moon are different from moon rocks from Earth. The US and Russia (the only countries ever in the position to collect moon-rocks) both agree that their rocks came from the moon.&quot;</p>

<p>So what exactly does this prove? Here is what it proves:</p>

<p>The US and Russia both have rocks from the Moon. And even if one believed that was true, since we already know that an unmanned Russian rover could collect moon-rocks, then we are still left without any proof that a man stepped foot on the moon. </p>

<p>Lunar rocks can be found on Earth.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_rock">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_rock</a></p>

<p>Moon rocks on Earth come from three sources: </p>

<p>1) those collected by the US Apollo manned lunar landings from 1969 to 1972</p>

<p>2) samples returned by three Soviet Luna unmanned probes in the 1970s</p>

<p>3) <strong>and rocks that were ejected naturally from the lunar surface by cratering events and subsequently fell to Earth as lunar meteorites.</strong> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, I don&#39;t know what to tell you, I already explained to you that lunar meteorites have features that make them different from collected lunar rocks as they had to travel through Earth&#39;s atmosphere which &quot;burned&quot; the outside of them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On a broken or sawn face, all lunar meteorites look like some kinds of Earth rocks, even to an experienced lunar scientist. We can often tell that they came from space, however, because many lunar meteorites have fusion crusts (the olive-green crust on the photo above) from the melting of the exterior that occurs during their passage through Earth&#39;s atmosphere.</p>

<p>The Apollo and Luna rocks don&#39;t have this fusion crust.</p>

<p>I already told you. The only people in the position to tell us about the &quot;unique geological features on the moon rocks that aren&#39;t present in rocks on Earth&quot; are the same people who apparently collected them.</p>

<p>And what a great system because we cannot compare those moon rocks from the moon to an <em>independent</em> source that also has moon rocks from the moon. This is basic logic at this point.</p>

<p>And no, I do not believe the &quot;Russians&quot; are an independent source. </p>

<p>Once again, it seem you aren&#39;t even reading what people are writing:</p>

<p>326 <strong>grams</strong> were collected by the Luna missions.  380.05 <strong>kilograms</strong> (1 kilogram is <strong>1000 grams</strong>) were collected by the Apollo missions.  This is more than <strong>one thousand</strong> times the mass of the rocks collected on the Luna missions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I already told you. The only people in the position to tell us about the &quot;unique geological features on the moon rocks that aren&#39;t present in rocks on Earth&quot; are the same people who apparently collected them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, incorrect.  You aren&#39;t reading the links being provided:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some 10 kg (22 lb) of the Moon rocks have been used in hundreds of experiments performed by both NASA researchers and planetary scientists at research institutions unaffiliated with NASA. These experiments have confirmed the age and origin of the rocks as lunar, and were used to identify lunar meteorites collected later from Antarctica.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The rocks were actually used to confirm what we believed to be lunar meteorites.  </p>

<p>So again, I ask, how did we bring back 380.05 <strong>kilograms</strong> of moon rocks if we didn&#39;t send people to the moon?</p>

<p>Furthermore, how did these moon rocks retrieved match the lunar meteorites on Earth, confirmed by independent parties to both be from the moon, if we never went there?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jeez, how hard is this to understand.</p>

<p>The premise of the video is that it is easier to go to the moon than to fake going to the moon. </p>

<p>Since &quot;going to the moon&quot; is being questioned, you cannot make it a variable in a premise that is supposed to answer whether we went or not.</p>

<p>It is a logical fallacy of the highest order.</p>

<p>What is wrong with this statement: </p>

<p>&quot;Going to the moon (which may or may not have been faked) was easier than faking the moon landing and that proves that we went to the moon.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look I know you have your beliefs, and that&#39;s fine, but I disagree with your conclusions. </p>

<p>To me, it&#39;s clear that there was no spotlight used in the shot. You would have been able to see the light source in the reflection on the space helmet visor. </p>

<p>Remember these were all encoded on film, if the reflection were to be &quot;faked&quot; then it would have to been faked at the time of the shot. Using old style practical film techniques, glass pane paintings,
mattes, backdrop. Taking that into consideration, in a world without photoshop pro, this would have had to been the BEST special effect shot in the history of the world. </p>

<p>A contrast change in a photo however, that to me proves nothing. </p>

<p>EDIT: Not to mention the original conspiracy about a spot light. The guy is standing right next to the lander leg, covered in semi reflective gold foil. Which would act like a reflector. </p>

<p>“It is commonly believed that man will fly directly from the earth to the moon, but to do this, we would require a vehicle of such gigantic proportions that it would prove an economic impossibility. It would have to develop sufficient speed to penetrate the atmosphere and overcome the earth’s gravity and, having traveled all the way to the moon, it must still have enough fuel to land safely and make the return trip to earth. Furthermore, in order to give the expedition a margin of safety, we would not use one ship alone, but a minimum of three … each rocket ship would be taller than New York’s Empire State Building [almost ¼ mile high] and weigh about ten times the tonnage of the Queen Mary, or some 800,000 tons.”</p>

<p>Because I see MIT teach about it, it&#39;s even on their website: <a href="http://apollo40.mit.edu/">http://apollo40.mit.edu/</a></p>

<p>Harvard too: <a href="http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2012/02/from-v-2-rocket-to-moon-landing/">http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2012/02/from-v-2-rocket-to-moon-landing/</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Your quote you cited is from the book that Von Braun wrote in 1953, in the 16 years time frame after that book, he and other scientists developed the technology to go to the moon. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t seem to be getting this. </p>

<p>And your experts believe we are 100+ years away is pure BS. </p>

<p>If the video is to be trusted, then NASA had the tech to remotely control a video camera that was 239,000 miles away.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure you can find footage from inside the Apollo flights where the camera is pointed at a window where only empty space is visible. Obviously because of high exposure it wouldn&#39;t show the stars.</p>

<p>Why they can&#39;t install such a camera? There is the Hubble that is meant for just that purpose.</p>

<p>Other than huge telescopes there&#39;s not much point having a camera pointed at stars. The view would be boring and waste bandwidth to broadcast it to Earth.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right they don&#39;t stare down at the Earth the whole time, but I guess the only time they do look from the windows is times when there is anything to see. It might be hard to see stars even from the window unless you flip down all the lights from the spacecraft and have the window at Sun side closed to allow your eyes to dark adapt properly.</p>

<p>What I would like to know is how this is relevant to the Moon landing hoax theory? :P</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m glad you are is sure of yourself. How many more years are you going to wait until they get a man anywhere besides low earth orbit before you wake up? Another 40?
Would you believe someone who claimed they flew a plane faster than the speed of sound if they no one ever surpassed 200mph for the next 60 years?
Low-earth orbit = 200-400 miles above earth.
Moon - 200,000 miles away. That is 1000x further than we have ever made it before.
Did you know NASA claims they lost every single copy of every single original apollo 11 recording and all of the blueprints?
<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/07/16/us-nasa-tapes-idUSTRE56F5MK20090716">http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/07/16/us-nasa-tapes-idUSTRE56F5MK20090716</a>
That was 700 BOXES of priceless artifacts that they lost. Do you really believe this?
These apollo moon missions only happened during Nixon&#39;s administration and have never been repeated.
Lastly, read this analysis of the logistical impossibility of taking 5771 photos in 4800 minutes with gloves on and no viewfinder.
Here is a study by analyst Jack White. He has studied this moon landing hoax more than anyone. Here, he puts it to the math test to show the impossibility of what NASA is asking us to believe. I visited several official NASA websites to find HOW MANY PHOTOS WERE TAKEN on the surface of the Moon. Amazingly, NASA AVOIDS THIS SUBJECT almost entirely. Two days of searching documents and text were fruitless. But Lunar Surface Journal, one of the sites, lists every photo with its file number. So I undertook to make an actual count of every photo taken by astronauts DURING EXTRA-VEHICULAR ACTIVITY (EVA), the time spent on the surface out of the LEM.
Here is my actual count of EVA photos of the six missions:
Apollo 11……….. 121 Apollo 12……….. 504 Apollo 14……….. 374 Apollo 15……….1021 Apollo 16……….1765 Apollo 17……….1986
So 12 astronauts while on the Moon’s surface took a TOTAL of 5771 exposures.
That seemed excessively large to me, considering that their TIME on the lunar surface was limited, and the astronauts had MANY OTHER TASKS OTHER THAN PHOTOGRAPHY. So I returned to the Lunar Surface Journal to find how much TIME was available to do all the scientific tasks AS WELL AS PHOTOGRAPHY. Unlike the number of photos, this information is readily available:
Apollo 11……..1 EVA …..2 hours, 31 minutes……(151 minutes) Apollo 12……..2 EVAs…..7 hours, 50 minutes……(470 minutes) Apollo 14……..2 EVAs…..9 hours, 25 minutes……(565 minutes) Apollo 15……..3 EVAs…18 hours, 30 minutes….(1110 minutes) Apollo 16……..3 EVAs…20 hours, 14 minutes….(1214 minutes) Apollo 17……..3 EVAs…22 hours, 04 minutes….(1324 minutes)
Total minutes on the Moon amounted to 4834 minutes. Total number of photographs taken was 5771 photos.
Hmmmmm. That amounts to 1.19 photos taken EVERY MINUTE of time on the Moon, REGARDLESS OF OTHER ACTIVITIES. (That requires the taking of ONE PHOTO EVERY 50 SECONDS!) Let’s look at those other activities to see how much time should be deducted from available photo time:
Apollo 11….Inspect LEM for damage, deploy flag, unpack and deploy radio and television equipment, operate the TV camera (360 degree pan), establish contact with Earth (including ceremonial talk with President Nixon), unpack and deploy numerous experiment packages, find/document/collect 47.7 pounds of lunar rock samples, walk to various locations, conclude experiments, return to LEM.
Apollo 12….Inspect LEM for damage, deploy flag, unpack and deploy radio and television equipment (spend time trying to fix faulty TV camera), establish contact with Earth, unpack and deploy numerous experiment packages, walk to various locations, inspect the unmanned Surveyor 3 which had landed on the Moon in April 1967 and retrieve Surveyor parts. Deploy ALSEP package. Find/document/collect 75.7 pounds of rocks, conclude experiments, return to LEM.
Apollo 14….Inspect LEM for damage, deploy flag, unpack and deploy radio and television equipment and establish contact with Earth, unpack and assemble hand cart to transport rocks, unpack and deploy numerous experiment packages, walk to various locations. Find/document/collect 94.4 pounds of rocks, conclude experiments, return to LEM.
Apollo 15….Inspect LEM for damage, deploy flag, unpack and deploy radio and television equipment and establish contact with Earth, unpack/assemble/equip and test the LRV electric-powered 4-wheel drive car and drive it 17 miles, unpack and deploy numerous experiment packages (double the scientific payload of first three missions). Find/document/collect 169 pounds of rocks, conclude experiments, return to LEM. (The LRV travels only 8 mph.)
Apollo 16….Inspect LEM for damage, deploy flag, unpack and deploy radio and television equipment and establish contact with Earth, unpack/assemble/equip and test the LRV electric-powered 4-wheel drive car and drive it 16 miles, unpack and deploy numerous experiment packages (double the scientific payload of first three missions, including new ultraviolet camera, operate the UV camera). Find/document/collect 208.3 pounds of rocks, conclude experiments, return to LEM. (The LRV travels only 8 mph.)
Apollo 17….Inspect LEM for damage, deploy flag, unpack and deploy radio and television equipment and establish contact with Earth, unpack/assemble/equip and test the LRV electric-powered 4-wheel drive car and drive it 30.5 miles, unpack and deploy numerous experiment packages. Find/document/collect 243.1 pounds of rocks, conclude experiments, return to LEM. (The LRV travels only 8 mph.)
Let’s arbitrarily calculate a MINIMUM time for these tasks and subtract from available photo time:
Apollo 11…subtract 2 hours (120 mins), leaving 031 mins for taking photos Apollo 12…subtract 4 hours (240 mins), leaving 230 mins for taking photos Apollo 14…subtract 3 hours (180 mins), leaving 385 mins for taking photos Apollo 15…subtract 6 hours (360 mins), leaving 750 mins for taking photos Apollo 16…subtract 6 hours (360 mins), leaving 854 mins for taking photos Apollo 17…subtract 8 hours (480 mins), leaving 844 mins for taking photos
So do the math:
Apollo 11…..121 photos in 031 minutes……..3.90 photos per minute Apollo 12…..504 photos in 230 minutes……..2.19 photos per minute Apollo 14…..374 photos in 385 minutes……..0.97 photos per minute Apollo 15…1021 photos in 750 minutes……..1.36 photos per minute Apollo 16…1765 photos in 854 minutes …….2.06 photos per minute Apollo 17…1986 photos in 844 minutes …….2.35 photos per minute
Or, to put it more simply:
Apollo 11……..one photo every 15 seconds Apollo 12……..one photo every 27 seconds Apollo 14……..one photo every 62 seconds Apollo 15……..one photo every 44 seconds Apollo 16……..one photo every 29 seconds Apollo 17……..one photo every 26 seconds
So you decide. Given all the facts, was it possible to take that many photos in so short a time?
Any professional photographer will tell you it cannot be done. Virtually every photo was a different scene or in a different place, requiring travel. As much as 30 miles travel was required to reach some of the photo sites. Extra care had to be taken shooting some stereo pairs and panoramas. Each picture was taken without a viewfinder, using manual camera settings, with no automatic metering, while wearing a bulky spacesuit and stiff clumsy gloves.
The agency wants the world to believe that 5771 photographs were taken in 4834 minutes! IF NOTHING BUT PHOTOGRAPHY HAD BEEN DONE, such a feat is clearly impossible…made even more so by all the documented activities of the astronauts. Imagine…1.19 photos every minute that men were on the Moon – that’s one picture every 50 SECONDS!
The secret NASA tried to hide has been discovered: The quantity of photos purporting to record the Apollo lunar EVAs could not have been taken on the Moon in such an impossible time frame. So why do these photos exist? How did these photos get made? Did ANY men go to the Moon? Or was it truly the greatest hoax ever?

    <div class="md"><p>This is not how you argue something. We placed rovers on Mars, but we are currently unable to place a human on Mars - so you&#39;re missing the point. The ISS and any other MANNED mission EVER has stayed in low earth orbit except Apollo. The moon is 1000x further (roughly) and we did it in the 60s. The Apollo missions were an extreme outlier and we have not been even 1/4 that distance since. The reflectors could have been placed there by unmanned craft if need be. Either way - I am not sure if the whole thing was hoaxed, but I do feel certain parts of it are suspicious (like when the crew placed a fake image of the earth on the window to make it look like they were far from Earth - not sure if you have seen that). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is not much to discuss if your only argument is &quot;that doesn&#39;t look real&quot;. A landing from orbit to the surface, looks real to me. In the other reply, a ascent stage going up in low gravity, how else should it look?</p>

<p>The only thing I can say to the argument that things don&#39;t look real is that what Nasa could not have faked during those times is the lunar scenery. They didn&#39;t have the capabilities to 3D map the Moon in such detail that they could have reproduced it 1:1 in a studio. Their studio scenery would be just a guess and it would be easily seen today it doesn&#39;t represent the reality. It is said that the landing &amp; orbit footage had been faked using the small Moon model Nasa had, but people fail to understand how much bigger the real Moon is than the studio set and how much more detail there is to it.</p>

<p>There are other aspects of the footage that would be incredibly hard to reproduce in a studio set, like the gravity. In order to the astronauts, kicked sand &amp; thrown objects to move like they did they should all be suspended mechanically or by some other means to lessen the apparent gravity. That&#39;s of course impossible or very hard at least. Nobody has come up with a theory how that could&#39;ve been accomplished.</p>

the later approach on editing, with new opinions how documentary photos should look like, was to do less editing. </p>

<p>here is an article how much editing was going on in the darkroom before photosshop.

    <div class="md"><p>In the first picture, the original:</p>

<p>Look at the ground, it appears as if Aldrin is standing in a circle of light that diminishes with distance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That isn&#39;t what the photo is showing at all. If it was a spotlight shining on Aldrin then the shadows in the distance wouldn&#39;t line up with the rest of the shadows in the picture. Just look at the large rock in the background. See how it&#39;s shadow falls in line with Aldrin&#39;s (upper-right lightsource, slightly backlit, shaded on left and lower front, casting shadow towards the left and forground). That is the kind of effect you get from a huge lightsource a long ways away, not from a spotlight however many hundreds of meters your theory can concievably pretend is hoisted in the sky. </p>

<p>Furthermore, the first image looks like the edited one. It&#39;s likely that NASA touched it up before sending it to be published. As in NASA got back a sweet pic of Aldrin and touched it up so they could send a super cool photo for the papers to run for the first men on the moon. </p>

<p>The reason I say this is because the second photo that you claim is the edited one [the brighter one] can easily be edited into the first photo. More specifically, the <strong>entire photo can be edited wholesale (meaning the the area around Aldrin&#39;s feet and Aldrin himself are edited to the same scales and values as the rest of the image)</strong> and the result is extremely similar to the photo that you claim is the original. </p>

<p>Look at <a href="http://i.imgur.com/wznXV8I.jpg">this</a> version of the bright image that I edited in literally less than a minute. Looks pretty similar yeah? Could have used a little color correction, but the lighting is almost identical. The fact that I got this result by editing the entire image, rather playing only with the values in the background, is pretty indicative that your theory is flawed. Nobody brightened the background the match the foreground to remove the evidence the a spotlight was used, even if you ignore that the photo doesn&#39;t indicated a spotlight in either version.</p>

The tiny value difference between the foreground and backround is made larger as you increase contrast, making the backround look much darker than the foreground.

You have also completely ignored the shadows I have mentioned, and as a photo-editor you should be keenly aware of the way light and shadow work. </p>

<p>The circle of light he is standing in is exactly what we would see if a hanging spotlight were used. The circle of light was not edited into the picture to make it look more dramatic. And the effects you are talking about would make a circle on the PHOTO, not on the GROUND of the photo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course there wasnt a circle of light edited into the photo. And again, in no world does a spotlight above Aldrin create identical shadows on the rocks in the background. That isnt how light and shadow work.</p>

<p>And what im talking about doesnt create a circle on a photo. What im talking about increases the difference in values already present in an image. I dont believe you actually do have any knowledge if photo-editing at this point. Look at the photo I edited. By simply increasing contrast and pulling light levels down, you get a result that looks nearly identical to the photo that you claim shows a spotlight. Do it yourself (if you actually have the know-how) and you can see it for yourself.</p>

<p>Explain why the shadows tell us of a single and distant light source and why simple value adjustment produces exactly the effect you are seeing, and you might have an argument.</p>

<p>No human ever, has gone past low earth orbit, except for the guys in the Apollo program.</p>

<p>People in the space industry claim that we are atleast 100+ years from having the technology to get a man on the moon, it has been nearly 50 years already, factor this in with the fact there is literally no evidence we have ever been to the moon because it has all been &quot;lost&quot; or destroyed and the hundreds of other anomalies.</p>

<p>The story is unbelievable in this day and age, have a read of this</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Apollo program was pretty amazing. You can really see what they did with their slice of GDP. You really can&#39;t understand much about the engineering choices without understanding the rocket equation. The rocket equation determines the total ∆V of a craft (it&#39;s ability to change velocity) with the exhaust velocity, and the propellant-mass fraction. The math all checks out, and if you don&#39;t believe NASA&#39;s numbers, you can see that they&#39;re within an order of magnitude or so, if you do a bit of legwork to estimate them from other sources. The math to calculate ∆V isn&#39;t really that unaccessible if you&#39;ve completed high school, and the orbital mechanics should be fairly easy to pick up to anyone whose taken a few calc classes and diffeq.</p>

So  at family gatherings there were at least three people separately involved with the Apollo missions. 
I&#39;m not saying they couldn&#39;t be lying, anything is possible. But in this case it was such a point of pride for each one of them they still had patches and mission coins and tons of souvenirs, photos and autographs of people like LBJ and Von Braun. 
If it was faked--- it didn&#39;t have to be. From the people who worked on the actual physical craft that landed on the surface to the people who developed the telemetry systems in the Air Force to rocket scientists at Huntsville - I can say personally I&#39;m convinced we went to the moon. And I maintain that NASA started the rumor in the attempt to force the government&#39;s hand because the FBI confiscated most of the mission critical data and classified it leaving some people to start over from square one</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is a thing to consider.</p>

<p>Printing has advanced a lot since the late 60s. Color printing in newspapers was super rare back then; things were usually reproduced as really low-res (by modern standards) halftones. Then printed with smeary inks, on shitty paper. Dark areas would close up and lose contrast, bright areas would blow out, it was really just generally kind of terrible reproduction. It was not uncommon for newspapers to edit their photos to compensate for this - burning and dodging in the darkroom, pulling out an airbrush to blur out superfluous details to make the subject pop, etc.</p>

<p>Is it that much of a stretch to imagine that this &quot;spotlit&quot; photo was edited by NASA with the intent of looking better after passing through this shitty reproduction? Load these both into Photoshop and convert them to B&amp;W as, oh, an 85lpi halftone screen; which one turns into a washed-out mess?</p>

<p>The OP entire argument is that the photo was taken with a spot light meaning to him that it was faked and not taken on the moon. </p>

<p>He came to that conclusion because NASA later brightened the photo years later, meaning to OP they were trying to hide a spot light source. </p>

<p><a href="http://youtu.be/cOdzhQS_MMw">http://youtu.be/cOdzhQS_MMw</a></p>

<p>How do explain the panning of the camera?  Remote control via Houston?  Hmmm. </p>

<p>What about the fact that the astronauts are communicating with Houston with no appreciable time delay even though they are 287,000 miles away?  We can&#39;t even do that with a newscast from the other side of the world. Is this believable?</p>

<p>And lastly, why haven&#39;t we been back since the amount of fuel is almost the same as LEO and we already have the technology. Doesn&#39;t that disturb you?  Over a hundred space shuttle missions but no return to the moon. Another hmmm.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What made it b grade? The hop as it lifted off? It makes a lot of sense as the combustion cycle had not yet stabilized, and explosive bolts held the LM together, and some pressure (compressed He?) was used to pump the propellants out, and the RCS was likely used as ullage motors to insure that the engine got fed correctly. It seems awfully crazy that some apparent discrepancy, not apparent in the <a href="https://youtu.be/E96EPhqT-ds">original recordings</a> would have to have actually been there, not just part of the editing of various documentaries, and that the original recordings are fake.

    <div class="md"><p>This is not how you argue something. We placed rovers on Mars, but we are currently unable to place a human on Mars - so you&#39;re missing the point. The ISS and any other MANNED mission EVER has stayed in low earth orbit except Apollo. The moon is 1000x further (roughly) and we did it in the 60s. The Apollo missions were an extreme outlier and we have not been even 1/4 that distance since. The reflectors could have been placed there by unmanned craft if need be. Either way - I am not sure if the whole thing was hoaxed, but I do feel certain parts of it are suspicious (like when the crew placed a fake image of the earth on the window to make it look like they were far from Earth - not sure if you have seen that). </p>

<p>You do know multiple countries are planning moon bases right</p>

<p>Yeah and do you know the time frame the experts in this field have said when we <strong>might</strong> be capable to achieve this?</p>

<p>The answer is at least 100+ years</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another interesting thing to think about.</p>

<p>If the video is to be trusted, then NASA had the tech to remotely control a video camera that was 239,000 miles away.</p>

<p>Yet we have no post-Apollo photos or videos of the Earth. Why can&#39;t they set up a similar rig in the window of one of their (outside of LEO) unmanned rockets?</p>

<p>Then we would have more evidence of what Earth looks like from outside of LEO.</p>
