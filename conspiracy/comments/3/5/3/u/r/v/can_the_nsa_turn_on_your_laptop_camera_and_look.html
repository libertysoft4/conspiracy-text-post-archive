<p>Apple changed to a different system since (i.e., you can&#39;t use the same trick anymore) but I&#39;m sure the new one also has some vulnerability, possibly built in deliberately.</p>

<p>Imagine how sweet it must be for those lonely NSA dudes, being able to peer lovingly at their crush through a hacked webcam.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Best solution I can figure out, on Windows at least, is to disable all the audio input drivers. I don&#39;t know if that will actually work though. I&#39;m quite certain the NSA can reach out to any Windows computer and do whatever the fuck they want, so the protection would have to be hardware / physical instead of software / configuration. Unplug the mic from motherboard. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If someone tells you the NSA can turn on your camera, they are manipulating you and trying to mislead you. Of they are just ignorant, passing on what was told to them. </p>

<p>The truth is that computers can be controlled remotely. This means <em>anyone</em> could turn on your camera if they could gain access and knew what they were doing. Does this include the NSA? Of course. But it also includes the rest of the human race. By making this seem like an NSA-specific risk, your teacher is manipulating you to further an agenda. </p>

<p>Personally, I doubt it. Many of the people that, hypothetically, they&#39;d want to do this to would likely be savvy enough to be properly protected against such an attack, as well as capable of monitoring their network to detect the traffic that a live camera feed would create.  Wouldn&#39;t be worth the risk to them, IMO.</p>

<p>Now, can the NSA just open your webcam&#39;s feed on <em>any</em> computer without you noticing just like that? Doubtful, physical access to your equipment is usually needed. But it&#39;s still a very real possibility.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I remember that story breaking. If one of my kids is ever offered a school-owned laptop, the first thing I&#39;m doing is opening it and physically disabling the webcam and microphone.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s the school&#39;s owned equipment.</p>

<p>While physical access is the easiest means of doing this, I believe I&#39;ve read that there is also malware out there that can let this happen remotely; however, any user with half a lick of sense wouldn&#39;t fall for that.</p>

<p>Young naive teenagers, on the other hand, unfortunately, sometimes do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not malware that allows this. It&#39;s a built in capability of the operating system. Computers are DESIGNED to be remotely controlled. If you can use a mouse and keyboard to control a computer from 2 feet away, why couldn&#39;t you do it from across the world?</p>
