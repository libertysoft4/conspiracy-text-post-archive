        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>When you are born, you are automatically born into slavery:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/07/09/opinion/declercq-childbirth-costs/">http://www.cnn.com/2013/07/09/opinion/declercq-childbirth-costs/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>giving birth in the U.S. is more expensive than any other country in the world. Total costs average $18,329 for a vaginal delivery and $27,866 for a C-section, with the bulk of the bill going to insurers. However, families with insurance still have to pay about $3400 out of pocket.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Furthermore, your Birth Certificate, is a a Bank Note making you a bank commodity:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.viewzone.com/collateralx.html">http://www.viewzone.com/collateralx.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let&#39;s take a pause to look at the Birth Certificates [below]. You will see the red numbers and you will see the fact that it is, in reality, a &quot;Bank Note.&quot; Congratulations -- you and I are commodities!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your parents then program you with labels, ideas, constructs, and belief systems based on what they were programmed, all part of the worldly system. They also pass on epigenetics based programming into you.</p>

<p>Once you enter school, you start getting &quot;programmed/brainwashed&quot; via Common Core, with history books written by the winners of wars, without revealing the perspective of the losing side.</p>

<p>You are then told the American dream is to have a college education which ties you to debt slavery (college loans), that you have to have a nice house (mortgage debt slavery), a nice care (car loan debt slavery).</p>

<p>The Mortgage is the worst because you are tie to it for the rest of your life. A 200k house being paid over a 30 year mortgage ends up costing you 450k-550k, 2-3 times of the original cost.</p>

<p><a href="https://thisiswhyubroke.wordpress.com/2010/05/21/the-mortgage-interest-deduction-hustle-and-why-youre-falling-for-it/">https://thisiswhyubroke.wordpress.com/2010/05/21/the-mortgage-interest-deduction-hustle-and-why-youre-falling-for-it/</a></p>

<p>The TV,music, books, media, MSM, Government, friends, everything is inserting programming into your subconscious.</p>

<p>The food and water is filled with pesticides, lead, mercury, pharma runoff, glyphosate in the air, chem trails in the sky.]</p>

<p>Then when you die, you have to pay for that death:</p>

<p><a href="http://funeral-tips.com/funeral-costs-how-much-does-an-average-funeral-cost/">http://funeral-tips.com/funeral-costs-how-much-does-an-average-funeral-cost/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Today, the average North American traditional funeral costs between $7,000 and $10,000.  This price range includes the services at the funeral home, burial in a cemetery, and the installation of a headstone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your 5 of your senses are limited compared to complete spectrum of sound, sight, touch, smell, tastes, as evident in other animals, you aren&#39;t perceiving reality as it really is.</p>

<p><a href="http://io9.com/5926643/10-fundamental-limits-to-human-perception----and-how-they-shape-your-world">http://io9.com/5926643/10-fundamental-limits-to-human-perception----and-how-they-shape-your-world</a></p>

<p>SO you want to think about all of this so you can logically and reasonably come to a conclusion? Well guess what, you might want to take a look of this list of cognitive biases that shape exactly how you come to conclusions:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/cognitive-biases-2014-6">http://www.businessinsider.com/cognitive-biases-2014-6</a></p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases</a></p>

<p>There are about 130 + biases that filter your logic/reason/rationality and I haven&#39;t even mentioned emotional bias, epigentic bias (which is a brand new field) and hidden/unknown biases that can even come from the posioned food/water supply, haarp, levels of oxygen/pollution, subconscious, etc,  the list goes on and on</p>

<p>Now, I haven&#39;t posted any solutions yet, which I believe have to do with becoming conscious of all these things as well as spiritual enlightenment which teaches a complete transcendence and mastery over all of this. I simply want to show you that the system of slavery is global, mental, physical, financial, psychological, and on virtually every level</p>

<p>TL:DR You are born a slave of the system, the system in slaves via loans, mental/psych programming, genetics, food supply is poisoned, and it costs you to die too</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s on purpose, and it&#39;s not your fault! Everyone suffers under this system in different ways, and the way out is love. We are all one and once we realize this we can dispel these illusions with ease.</p>

<p>If you want solutions for today, learn to grow food. Then go, grow food anywhere you can. Teach others, and feed others.</p>

<p>We can&#39;t unplug from the system until we can support ourselves. They have tried to make us dependent and we have to want to break that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First all of what you described is a path through life.  The amazing thing that happened when the Constitution was written was that the US guaranteed liberty.  That means if your parents choose to home school you they can. If at 18 you choose to not go into debt through higher education you can.  Sure food and water may be slowly being poisoned but you have the choice to build a garden and grow your own food and filter your own water.  You however cannot steal food from someone who does and that is because when you were born you were given a birth certificate by the government.  Long story short this is a right that people died for in England long ago.  Wiki MAGNA CARTA.  Those people died so that there was a system put in place that upon birth the person was put into a social contract with the governing body of the land that basically said they will allow themselves to be prosecuted if they break any of the rules of the land they were born in.  Law is based on the fact that everyone has due process and this is the best way to assure that everyone gets that.  Sure we don&#39;t get it right all the time but its the process that is important so that even if we stray for a while progress is made in the long run.  </p>

<p>If you feel you are being oppressed think about what it would&#39;ve been like for a serf in Europe 600 years ago.  If the ruling class wanted to have sex with your wife on your wedding night or felt like you needed to be tortured until you said you agreed with their opinion; tough luck if you didn&#39;t like it.  You have no recourse whatsoever. </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t like it turn off the TV, turn off the internet, go out and do something about it instead of spouting this whining you call truth.  Or maybe try reading a book.</p>

<p>I hope anyone who has read your diatribe is fully aware of cognitive bias.  What your saying is as bad as what you hear on FoxNews.</p>

<p>Yes</p>

<p>I trace my thoughts often. If you are talking about the &#39;initial thought&#39;, I would guess it would be about the difference in sensations.</p>

<p>My water is very pure and my food is about 75% non-gmo organically grown, with more soon to be ripe.</p>

<p>If everything I&#39;ve seen about baby making is correct, one could argue that I didn&#39;t decide to be born. But that is making the assumption that each person is a separate consciousness.</p>
