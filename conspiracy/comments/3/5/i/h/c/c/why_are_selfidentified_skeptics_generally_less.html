It&#39;s healthy to be skeptical!&quot; He&#39;s even the head of Skeptic Magazine... but he swallows every government lie hook, line, and sinker! He&#39;s among the <em>least</em> skeptical people I&#39;ve ever seen, a poster boy for the obedient little sheep while claiming to be a great man of science and reason and skepticism....

    <div class="md"><p>I think I saw that same debate. Shermer clearly lost by a lot, and by the end of it I thought he seriously looked like he was ready to cry. A few years later I was reading through his book &quot;Why Darwin Matters,&quot; and Shermer mentioned the same debate and actually wrote, &quot;My opponent lost the debate immediately because he mentioned Jesus.&quot; What a sleazy ass, Shermer lost the debate <em>badly</em> and then like a pompous high school drama queen he lies about it.

    <div class="md"><p>I was gonna write a response about him and a debate he did with David Cole on the Donahue show in the 90&#39;s.  You can already bet how that one goes over - it&#39;s on youtube.  Coles position is that the numbers of dead from the camps are inflated and the means are made up.  He makes this claim because he can find no evidence for it.  So in response Shermer actually claims that the burden of proof lies on Cole: That HE must prove a negative!  The default, comfortable, socially acceptable narrative is &quot;Truth&quot; apparently, and it is assumed that this socially acceptable truth has been vetted, investigated, tried and poked and prodded and verified as 100% fact.  This is a big problem, anyone with half a brain knows that people and governments lie, it will always be this way.  Real skeptics require proof for what they believe, and in my opinion it requires you to be fairly agnostic on a number of things.</p>

<p>So that&#39;s the problem with these types.  New or unusual information, which appears to them to be on its face suspicious or dubious is met with the reasonable and logical &quot;Show me the evidence!&quot; The problem is, that we ALL have worldviews and views of the universe which are both totally incorrect and held to be true and self evident as a result of culture, conditioning etc.  These &quot;default positions&quot; which may have been fed to us from the media or our culture are deeply embedded, they are not met with skepticism before they are digested into the subconscious.</p>

<p>This is why the typical &quot;9/11 debunker&quot; exists in my opinion.  The ridiculous official conspiracy is so well embedded that any kind of alternative explanation is met with a fairly violent; &quot;tinfoil hat!  Oh We already know what happened!  There&#39;s no evidence for your bullshit!&quot;  The reality is that I don&#39;t know exactly what happened that day, but neither does joe sixpack or some news anchor.  Skepticism isn&#39;t really skepticism if you can&#39;t back up your position with logic or evidence, and commonly held belief doesn&#39;t have to be based in either of those.</p>

<p>I completely agree that Shermer is one of the worst.  I doubt that he actually believes all the propaganda he spreads though.  He is most defiantly an agent much like the Mick West character.  If they (or their followers) do actually believe that literally every &quot;conspiracy&quot; is untrue and debunk-able just imagine the mathematical odds against that.  It means that they actually believe in a huge metaphysical conspiracy that will not allow a &quot;sinister&quot; plot to unfold.</p>

<p>How many people still think WTC7 fell due to office fires and cosmetic damage? It is really so obvious it has illuminated for me just how psychotic and delusional our country is.

<p>no it doesn&#39;t. </p>

<p>the universe was considered to be a static and stable construct for a long long time. then hubble (the astronomer that the telescope was named after) discovered  red shift, and over decades it was determined that the vast majority of the observable universe was moving away from us, and moreover, that the farther away something was, the faster it was accelerating away. </p>

<p>the only logical explanation was a big bang. scientists posited that <em>if there was a big bang, then there should still be residual shock waves and radiation left over from it</em> and other scientists went and found them. </p>

<p>there&#39;s a  debate about whether or not any information about the state of the universe before the big bang could have possibly survived the big bang. </p>

<p>Published in New Scientist, May 22, 2004</p>

<p>&quot;The big bang today relies on a growing number of hypothetical entities, things that we have never observed; inflation, dark matter and dark energy are the most prominent examples. Without them, There would be a fatal contradiction between the observations made by astronomers and the predictions of the big bang theory.  In no other field of physics would this continual recourse to new hypothetical objects be accepted as a way of bridging the gap between theory and observation.  It would, at the least, raise serious questions about the validity of the underlying theory.  But the big bang theory can&#39;t survive without these fudge factors…&quot;</p>

<p>If you blindly believe the scientific &quot;authority&quot; you are no less religious than the fundamental Christians.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just chiming in to offer another viewpoint.</p>

<p>I just read Hitchen&#39;s book <em>The Trial of Henry Kissenger.</em> I found it to be a fantastic read. He is on our team, so to speak. </p>

<p>I also read most of Dawkins&#39; books. I do agree that he is a dickhead. He&#39;s a very intelligent dickhead, however. </p>

<p>Extraordinary claims do require extraordinary evidence. If I claimed that I had eggs for breakfast, I don&#39;t really need to provide evidence of such a thing because it doesn&#39;t really matter. On the other hand, if I claimed that for almost every single war, the US government just so happened to have &quot;bad intelligence,&quot; rather than simply lying to go to war and make some money, I&#39;d need some strong evidence to prove my claim. See how that works both ways?</p>

<p>I do agree that the &quot;skeptic movement&quot; has been hijacked from the beginning. It&#39;s quite obvious that they rarely question the claims of government and corporations, even though these entities are compulsive liars. People like Shermer are clearly either delusional or on some kind of payroll.</p>

<p>First, the word extraordinary, is a relative concept.</p>

<p>Second, even if you can&#39;t provide direct evidence, there is still indirect evidence: history, statistics, psychological background on the parties involved, who benefited, money, math, various predictive models, philosophical analysis, cognitive bias, planetary/environmental/subconscious influences, and the list goes on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are some good answers below, but let me add one more.</p>

<p>Despite all the gaps and inconsistencies that get uncovered by conspiracy theorists, the official story is often still the one that is best supported by the evidence. </p>

<p>Conspiracy theorists contribute in a great way by asking lots of questions. That&#39;s a good thing. And most skeptics I know take the effort to rationally consider those questions. Up to that point, I would say that skeptics and conspiracy theorists are aligned.</p>

<p>Conspiracy theorists then take it to the next step and come up with alternative theories. Those theories are typically less rational and less supported by the evidence than the official ones. That&#39;s where you start losing skeptics.</p>

<p>Finally, when conspiracy theorists become dogmatic about their theories, start insulting anybody that questions them, calling sheep anybody who doesn&#39;t see them as &quot;undeniable truth&quot;, etc, that&#39;s when you definitely diverge from skeptics</p>

<p>If conspiracy theorists applied the same level of skepticism to YouTube videos when they support pre-held beliefs, that they do to MSM, they&#39;d view the world in a much better place.

<p>That kind of thing is simply an embarrassment. This place needs much MORE skepticism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its a balancing act. In a world where everyone believes that the earth is flat, pointing out the way a ship appears out of the horizon wouldn&#39;t convince a skeptic that the earth is round--even though it would be conclusive proof that it was.</p>

<p>We need both. ppl who readily explore alternative theories &amp; ppl who are skeptics. In some ways I view  skeptics as the gatekeepers of our world. Everytime an Einstein comes about, they are ridiculed because of skeptics. And unsuprisingly, skeptics are the last ones to adopt the &quot;newer&quot; science, because they have too much invested in their former understanding of the world.</p>

<p>There was a peer review on peer reviewed studies. And it turns out the most peer reviewed articles tended to be very well entrenched in scientific principles. However, less peer reviewed studies were more likely to be quoted because they were more likely to reveal newer areas of science. Skepticism is overrated. Imagination &amp; creativity is where its at. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Edit: the mistake you pointed out can happen to anyone including a skeptic. How would ppl read newspapers? Would you not believe anything you read? Because at some point you trust something or some source. And even after reading a trusted source, could you really trust them? Every attempt to read anything would turn out to be a philosophical exercise. Even the things we &quot;know&quot; to be true are taken on faith in many ways.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a balancing act, to be sure. Of course, for every &quot;Einstein&quot;, there&#39;s a hundred crackpots with perpetual motion machines who <em>think</em> they&#39;re the next Einstein. </p>

<p>The problem with conspiracies is that those proposing them tend to have no much investment, emotional or otherwise in them. In many cases, it&#39;s not a genuine quest for truth any more. Me, if conclusive proof came out tomorrow that JFK was killed by Oswald alone, I&#39;d have absolutely no problem with that. That, to me, is what skepticism is about: coming to conclusions based on <strong>the evidence</strong>, not what you want to be true, or because there was a document 50 years ago which suggested something kinda similar coughOperationNorthwoodscough.</p>

<p>The other problem is conspiracists&#39; reluctance to come up with an testable alternative hypothesis. We have a who, how and why for 9/11. It may not fit all the facts perfectly, but if you want me to change my mind, you need to come up with a who, how and why that fits the observed facts better. Highlighting eye-witness reports of molten steel is otherwise no more than slightly interesting. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>As with all data: taking into account the reliability of the source, based on its past record. If the information they have provided  previously has been accurately reported, then you put more credence in it. If it&#39;s a source with no track-record, which has demonstrated a clear agenda that skews its reporting (hello, ENE News!) or one which has previously been guilty of misreporting, you&#39;re more cautious. I&#39;ve seen enough faked photos before to know not to believe them, even if they&#39;re confirming a deeply-held belief - in this case, &quot;Reddit is corrupt&quot;. And again, if someone then shows up bringing additional information, I thank them, rather than lashing out. That&#39;s what seeking the truth is about. </p>

<p>You do realize that NIST hasnt released their model simulation parameters, right? You do realize what molten steel indicates?</p>

<p>This is precisely what I meant.... In a world where everyone thought that the earth was flat, skeptics would be the last to accept that a ship coming out of the horizon is an indication that the earth is round. Skepticism is almost lazy thinking. Sit back &amp; let others wade into the greyer areas. Once it becomes indefensible to hold on to a point of view, then switch boats. The most critical part of science isn&#39;t &quot;evidence&quot;, its inquiry. With only skepticism, we would still believe that the earth is flat.</p>

<p>I&#39;d be much happier if they did, certainly. But it doesn&#39;t make them <em>necessarily</em> wrong. It&#39;s also still more of a simulation than the 9/11 truth proponents have provided, since they haven&#39;t shown what was used to bring down the towers (beyond hand-waving about some kind of magical and undetectable &quot;super thermite&quot;), how it was put in place, etc. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>If it was &quot;steel&quot;. This is an assumption which has never been proved: people see molten metal and tend to assume steel, but NIST reckons it could have been aluminum, which melts at a much lower temperature. But even if it was steel, as NIST says, the condition of steel in the wreckage is &quot;irrelevant to the investigation of the collapse since it does not provide any conclusive information on the condition of the steel when the WTC towers were standing.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Not at all. When the facts don&#39;t fit a theory, it&#39;s conspiracy theorists we generally see disposing of the facts. Usually with something about &quot;shills&quot;, mainstream media, etc. It was non-scientists e.g. the Catholic Church - hardly the epitome of skepticism given their foundation of faith! - who were ACTUALLY the last to accept the round earth theory. </p>

The initial pouring of molten metal from the tower caught on tape was orange in color. This was explained as organic compounds from furnitures infused within the aluminum--thus the orange color. Even if that were true, it would not have explained how molten, orange metal remained for months.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Actually it was months, not days. In a oxygen deprived environment, beneath the rubble, the fire could not be completely extinguished until december. The jet fuel was burned away in minutes according to NIST. You would need an oxidizing agent to provide for such a long sustained fire.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am aware of rfk&#39;s article that was retracted.  So rfk did exaggerate some of his claims however, some of his claims were valid including the linear relationship between the greater numbers of vaccines administered to babies and greater occurrences of developmental disorders.  This evidence is still in the simpsonwood conference transcripts.  Rfk did not get that part wrong, but he exaggerated the severity of the findings from Simpsonwood by several orders of magnitude.</p>

<p>I am well aware that the mmr vaccine alone does not cause neurological impairment.  Not any one vaccine does.  And thimerosal studies have been done however, they were limited in scope and dont look at the whole picture.  the study that needs to be done is analyzing the development of mammalian brains when following the exact vaccination schedule of newborns, which is 26 vaccines over 48-months. none of the thimerosal studies besides 1 has studied thimerosal in brain tissue, that study proved that inorganic ethymercury accumulates in the brain.  Im sorry but you are citing studies that refer to one vaccine or studies that refer to testing the amount of thimerosal in the bloodstream.  There are no definitive studies under proper conditions.  The information you presented is relevant but it is far from complete in terms of the scope of this issue.</p>

<p>Not to mention the initial simpsonwood data, if you read the transcripts, indicates a signal.  Just because rfk got a few facts wrong does not mean the cdc got their initial findings wrong.  Keep in mind they added another cohort of data to manipulate the findings before they published their conclusions almost two years later.  Then several years after that the simpsonwood transcripts were released.  I am well aware of the data and studies you linked.  And they aren&#39;t wrong.  They are correct, but they are not the whole picture, they are incomplete in scope when you consider infants receive 26 vaccines not just an mmr vaccine, and the thimerosal studies are flawed in that they have not analyzed inorganic ethylmercury in the brain.</p>

<p>Seriously, just look at the simpsonwood data.  The signal is there.</p>

<p>In conclusion, even though Simpsonwood&#39;s data indicated a relationship betwen a larger number of vaccines in the first months of life and developmental disorders, even the doctors and scientists admitted they aren&#39;t sure if it was because of thimerosal or not.  At simpsonwood several doctors speculated it could be the aluminum found in vaccines, or other things.  They dont necessarily hold thimerosal accountable.  Rfk did though, but we both agree he got some of the facts wrong.</p>

<p>Do you think that the entire scientific community would ignore or expell tests that showed different results?

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Of course. But for the sake of discussion, when people talk about vaccine safety, they are generally speaking of the vaccines currently provided to the population. In the case of GMO&#39;s generally the discussion revolves around the safety of the act of genetically modifying something. A genetically modified organism could cause harm if it were modified to produce a harmful chemical etc., but so could an organism modified through standard breeding means. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>GMOs and vaccines have been introduced rapidly on a widespread basis outside of the laboratory. We are the laboratory. That&#39;s all that worries me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>GMO&#39;s have been around since the 1970&#39;s, and individual organisms are tested pretty heavily before making it on to your table. Subsequent testing, at least as far as I&#39;ve found, has found no inherent harm in the act of genetic modification. This makes sense, considering selective breeding and hybridization are essentially the same process, just more time-consuming.</p>

<p>Vaccines have been around for over 100 years. They have saved millions of lives. We have defeated diseases that used to wipe out civilizations. The current schedule has been around for quite some time now, and each one is tested exhaustively before reaching the market. </p>

<p>Your fears aren&#39;t totally out of place. Mistakes have been made previously, with individuals being harmed by vaccines. Luckily, we learn from those experiences and the process for testing and evaluating these shots have improved. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t speak to the benefits of Agroecology. I also can&#39;t think of a single holistic alternative capable or eradicating Polio or Small Pox. In fact, I&#39;m pretty sure there is no such holistic cure. </p>

<p>But even if the solutions are as robust as you claim, it does not mean we should stop looking at other alternatives. Vaccines have saved millions, and GMO&#39;s (Golden Rice being a perfect example) have the potential to save lives as well. It makes sense to look at all of them</p>

<p>No. I think a majority might ignore divergent test results but their expulsion by a vocal minority would suffice to cause for this.

<p>True. Partly true, simultaneous advances in hygiene and medical knowledge played a BIG role. False, those diseases are now either rare, weaponized, or both. False, the schedule has changed massively in the last decade. Mostly false, individual vaccines are often tested independent of one another. Testing fails to account for accumulative and long term risks. Many vaccines are fast tracked through the testing phase.</p>

<p>Partly true. See explanation above.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>GMO&#39;s (Golden Rice being a perfect example) have the potential to save lives as well</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mostly disagree. GMOs might be useful(bringing american chestnut back is a perfect example) but golden rice is a perfect example of a useless GMO. The whole reason for its creation is to combat a vitamin A deficiency prevalent among disenfranchised people whose diet consists solely of rice. &quot;Hey, I got a bright idea! You know those people who&#39;re literally sick from eating too much rice? Let&#39;s sell them some medicated rice! Genius!&quot;</p>

<p>Golden rice is also a perfect example of where agroecology could solve the problem ten times better: stop planting only rice. Plant some damn carrots and yams. Diversify their crop and their diet simultaneously. Vaboom! Instant improvements in ecological and bodily health.</p>

<p>The only reason they have monoculture diets anyway is because we promote monoculture as &quot;cash crops&quot; for sale on the international market. The whole food distribution system is fucked. Meanwhile, GMOs cost $1.5 million per patented organism. That money spent in agroecology could bring 1.5 million poverty stricken aid recipients into agricultural abundance while simultaneously enhancing the health of their landscape.</p>

<p>GMOs don&#39;t make cents.</p>

<p>And I still have yet to get an answer to the question of how vaccines are any different from homeopathy. (Take a diluted version of what makes you ill and you&#39;ll stay healthy! It&#39;s lunacy! Pure lunacy!) Btw, I approve of both vaccines and homeopathy. Still can&#39;t find a trustworthy source for my vaccines though...</p>

<p>This answer is a ridiculous answer to my question. You really think that scientists will actively ignore results indicating harm to individuals because they were conditioned to? What?</p>

<p>If the results show a causal relationship between a vaccine or GMO and an illness, how in the hell are scientists going to actively ignore it on a global scale?</p>

<p>A correlative relationship is not a causal relationahip. Incidences of death from communicable disease being a perfect example of this. Concurrently with the invention and implementation of vaccines, improvements in other areas of healthcare were already lowering deathrates from communicable disease. Thus jumping to the assumption that vaccines were the sole or even a major cause appears hasty lacking in academic integrity.</p>

<p>Simply by ascribing it to other factors. Look at all the carcinogens in the news. There&#39;s always a scapegoat. Look, I&#39;m not arguing that GMOs are causing harm. Get off your high horse. You don&#39;t need to defend GMOs from me. I&#39;m just saying that they&#39;re damn expensive and we&#39;ve rather jumped the gambit on commodifying novel technologies like GMOs and Vaccines. I might add onto that list fossil fuels and nuclear energy. </p>

<p>Can you provide some examples of situations you are talking about here? The point of scientific study is to investigate and eliminate bias via experimentation. Peer review then allows others to pick through these experiments and find potential weaknesses. I am not saying bias couldn&#39;t creep in, but on the global and universal scale you are describing it seems unlikely. Your vague description of this almost reminds me of similar arguments made by creationists or homeopaths, who will often blame some vague bias for their ideas not being accepted by the scientific community.</p>

<p>See, this is what gets me. You are attacking practitioners of the scientific method with vague accusations of bias on a global scale, then go on to cite a poorly thought out anti-vaxxer talking point. Of course other factors can cause a reduce in deathrates. better medical care, better access to good food and hygiene can all play a factor. But have you looked at instance rates relative to vaccine introductions? Or considered that illnesses like Polio and measles have negative effects beyond just death? Antivaxxers don&#39;t usually bring this up. They also ignore things like the way smallpox vaccines were implemented, not by wholesale mass vaccination, but by targeting outbreaks and stopping them. Small pox is now dead...gone. Polio isn&#39;t far behind. These are real world results linked directly to practices using vaccine. You can try to imply bias all you want, but the decline of many diseases in the world is a <em>direct</em> result of vaccines.</p>

<p>If this be the case, which it indeed be, then why all the fuss over how we &quot;need&quot; mandatory wholesale vaccination schedules? </p>

<p>The reason different methods are used is because different diseases spread in different ways and require different approaches. In the case of small pox it was effective to treat outbreaks locally. In the case of other illnesses, clearly a larger scale alternative is found to be preferable. Again, the results have been pretty good.</p>

<p>I used the smallpox vaccine as an example because it is impossible to deny the causation.</p>

<p>As for you statement of smallpox existing still in labs, I really don&#39;t see how that is relevant. Thanks to the vaccine, it is no longer in the wild.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not so clear to me, or many others. Seems like an unfounded assumption to me. Falling back to the whole herd immunity argument, which is baloney with most vaccinations since the viruses mutate faster than vaccines can keep up and vaccines are seldom 100% effective. </p>

<p>And as per Weaponized smallpox, one human error or one malicious psychopath could set off devastating outbreaks. Pretty relevant fears in the 21st century on a conspiracy forum </p>

<p>Herd immunity is not &quot;balcony&quot;. Read a goddamn book. Vaccines not being 100% effective is the whole reason why we mass vaccinate.

<p>That whole post has some crazy ideas, but do you mean to tell me, through this whole discussion, this was your understanding of vaccines? Because if it is, holy shit, you don&#39;t even understand the basics. Even Wikipedia could tell you that vaccines aren&#39;t watered down viruses. You don&#39;t really think that do you? In the simplest explanation, Vaccines contain variations of the virus that allow your body to build up the antibodies to fight and repel the real thing. This is in no way comparable to homeopathy.</p>

<p>To compare this to homeopathy is fucking laughable. This little nugget has seriously made me regret not seeing this edit earlier. Had I realized that your grasp of the topic was as poor as it is, I probably would&#39;ve ended the discussion far earlier.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They arent even close to similar. Again, your lack of knowledge is very obvious. Vaccines, for example, aren&#39;t diluted well past avogadro&#39;s constant. They also have actual tested scientific data to back them up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I understand. That&#39;s exactly your problem. Because I understand what you meant in that initial comment, you can&#39;t back out of your comically stupid statement. Let&#39;s look at it again, shall we?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I still have yet to get an answer to the question of how vaccines are any different from homeopathy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>any</em> is the key word there. By using that terminology you imply that they are one in the same. I would argue this goes well beyond simply a &quot;like cures like&quot; comparison.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(Take a diluted version of what makes you ill and you&#39;ll stay healthy! It&#39;s lunacy! Pure lunacy!)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Implying that Vaccines are in anyway diluted versions of viruses. They aren&#39;t They are variations of viruses designed to force your immune system to develop anti-bodies to fight it, without causing the harm of the actual virus. </p>

<p>Homeopathy, on the other hand, really isn&#39;t &quot;like cures like&quot; anyway. See, because it works by diluting a substance (not a virus) to absurd degrees, anything past 12c passes the Avogadro&#39;s constant. What that means, is that at this dilution, and anything past it, the chances of even finding a single molecole of the original substance in the solution is so low it may as well not be in there. So, when we recognize that a large percentage of homeopathic solutions (I would go as far as to say most I&#39;ve seen) are well above 12C, it isn&#39;t so much of &quot;like cures like&quot; and more like &quot;small amounts of water cures like&quot;.</p>

<p>So again, your &quot;analogy&quot; means nothing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Btw, I approve of both vaccines and homeopathy. Still can&#39;t find a trustworthy source for my vaccines though..</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You then state that you approve of homeopathy. Assuming you mean that you think it actually works, this stands as a very silly comment on its own. Perhaps you need to research Homeopathy and Vaccines more.</p>

<p>As a whole, your comment is clearly trying to conflate vaccines with homeopathic remedies despite the fact they share no actual similarities. It is clear in the context of your comment that your intent was to highlight some hypocrisy that you felt I harboured by supporting vaccination but presumably not believing in homeopathic &quot;remedies&quot;. Even at the most basic level, you analogy fails, and the fact that you used as an argument is laughable.</p>

<p>Just accept you said something stupid and resolve yourself to not make mistakes like that by actually putting in the effort to learn about the things you discuss. Read a wikipedia page on vaccines, click the links that the information comes from. Investigate the studies that show their effectiveness and safety. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>About vaccines if you really want to get into the thick of that conspiracy theory, it might have been a cover-up.</p>

<p>Thimerosal was an ethyl-mercury based preservative added to vaccines from the late 1930&#39;s to 2001.  If infants followed the recommended vaccination schedule, then an infant would receive an amount of ethylmercury that exceeded recommended limits of methylmercury, a similar mercury-based molecule.  However, preliminary testing showed that ethylmercury is cleared out of the blood stream approximately 5x faster than methylmercury, so Ethylmercury was considered safe.  However, another study proved that ethylmercury was cleared from the brain much more slowly than from the bloodstream.  In fact, Ethylmercury has a 26-day half-life in the brain.  Although ethylmercury is cleared from the brain more rapidly than methyl-mercury, ethylmercury actually leaves more inorganic mercury in the brain than methylmercury does.  The exact toxicity levels of inorganic ethylmercury are not known, it has not been studied.  It is curious that the toxicity of ethylmercury has not been studied considering it has been used in the USA in vaccinations from the 1930&#39;s until 2001.  Although thimerosal has been widely discontinued in the US and Europe, thimerosal is still used the flu vaccine in the USA, and thimerosal is used in child vaccines in 3rd world countries.</p>

<p>It is proven that low grade mercury poisoning can cause developmental problems in newborn mammals including cognitive impairments.</p>

<p>At the simpsonwood conference, a CDC researcher found a linear relationship or &quot;signal&quot; between the number of vaccines and the number of developmental disorders.  The researcher presented this data in private to members of the CDC, FDA, and pharma industry.
He had discovered there was a relationship between a larger number of vaccines in the first 3 to 6 months of life and a higher number of reported developmental disorders, based on analyzing thousands of patient files.  The attendees at the Simpsonwood conference were told to Keep this data confidental until the CDC released the study to the public.  Then the CDC researchers added another cohort of data, before any of this information was made public.  This new cohort of data added new patient records from a different hospital with a different record keeping system, with different systems of vaccinations, and they tweaked the criteria to remove the babies who had the highest number of vaccines, they removed that data to eliminate the relationship between vaccines and developmental disorders.  They manipulated the data.  They tweaked it so the vaccine data looked fine.  After the manipulated data was released to the public, thimerosal was removed from vaccines, even though they told us it was safe.  The thing is, thimerosal was invented in the 1930&#39;s.  Dont you think its possible scientific and safety standards improved since the 30&#39;s?  Back then, they didn&#39;t know better.  Also, there is proof of pharma fraud and pharma cover-ups in this nation.  Bayer knowingly sold blood products contaminated with HIV, and the FDA helped them cover it up until bayer got sued and had to pay hundreds of millions in damages.</p>

<p>Either way, the simpsonwood conference was largely classified for a number of years, but the transcripts of the simpsonwood conference were disclosed through the freedom of information act.  All the data is publicly available, you can read the transcripts online they are a couple hundred pages and very dry but all the data is there including the LINEAR relationship between a high number of vaccines in the first 6-months of life and developmental disorders. </p>

I&#39;m skeptical about the moon landing because I was literally a rocket scientist early in my career and I don&#39;t believe they could have gotten off the moon without changing the IMU over to moon-based coordinates using a survey point and a theodolite, but the moon has never been surveyed.   They claim they used a star finder to get a fix, but they also say they couldn&#39;t see any stars with the naked eye.  Losing all of the magnetic tapes from the apollo program is suspicious, but getting off the moon without initializing the IMU is more like hard evidence that the whole thing was faked, because I&#39;m an engineer. </p>

I swear sometimes my internet goes down minutes after posting something with a hint of dissent.  Yesterday I posted something a bit conspiratorial, which I know to be true because it has destroyed my career and my life, and my internet went down minutes later and was down for 15  hours.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the government fucked me over, and I doubt that I&#39;m the only one.  But, I&#39;ve seen them do worse.  I tried to call a lawyer last week, and then I got a call from Homeland Security asking me who I was.  The way you know it&#39;s DHS is because your phone says restricted number, meaning the government.  They called a second time and I had to pull the battery out of the phone so they couldn&#39;t trace it.  </p>

<p>Now I expect a paid troll to jump in here, especially on this sub, and demand proof, or start a straw man argument, but I may have just preempted that.  Either that or my internet will go down.</p>

<p>edit:  my internet went down for a few minutes right after I posted this :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually it&#39;s the reverse. And I am referring to people who subscribe to conspiracy theories.  </p>

<pre><code>http://www.businessinsider.com/trait-that-will-make-you-more-successful-2014-8

<p>as well as this:  </p>

<p>As usual, a matrix is used to categorize personality types and interestingly enuff, Conspiracy-minded types are a mix of:  </p>

<ul>
<li>Pessimistic<br/></li>
<li>Credulous<br/></li>
</ul>

<p>Not surprisingly BI says they also tend to be less successful in life and career.  Successful people, OTOH tend to be optimistic <em>AND</em> skeptical of anything new and unproven. They are always tearing apart any argument or idea; a kind of pre-stress testing so as not to get burned.  </p>

<p>What makes makes this all the more ironic is that &#39;Conspiratists&#39; are always accusing non-Conspiratists of being credulous &#39;Sheeple&#39;  </p>

<p>Well, I guess just another case of IKYABWAI, as made famous by PeeWee Herman.  </p>

<p>And there was also a reddit post, very scholarly &amp; academic that said the same thing.  </p>

<p>I call it Tee Ball posting.

    <div class="md"><p>Generally the person you call skeptics are not really skeptics at all.  The more appropriate term for them is followers of the norm.  They do not have genuine critical thinking skills or independent thought patterns of their own.  Sometimes they base their whole premise of skepticism on the belief that they have a adequate understanding of scientific and logical principles when in reality it is merely superficial.</p>

A few years later I was reading through his book &quot;Why Darwin Matters,&quot; and Shermer mentioned the same debate and actually wrote, &quot;My opponent lost the debate immediately because he mentioned Jesus.&quot; What a sleazy ass, Shermer lost the debate <em>badly</em> and then like a pompous high school drama queen he lies about it.
