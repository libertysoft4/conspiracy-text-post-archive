It could be preparation for Obama to erase the border and let a flood of Mexicans into the country. The mission of the troops would be to prevent U.S. citizens from interfering with the immigrants. The &quot;detention camps&quot; might be processing centers for the new residents, where they would be fed, get medical checks, ID cards, etc.</p>

<p>All the military gear being moved around, UN medical trucks being spotted, the closed Wal-Marts. The military will be used to keep peace and order once a national emergency is declared. The Wal-Marts could serve as FEMA centers for the displaced. </p>

<p>They know something we don&#39;t, and as another user said, I don&#39;t think a cataclysmic event is too big a pill to swallow. Whether it be an asteroid, San Andreas cutting lose, or Yellowstone. I&#39;m not too up on seismic activity, as in: I don&#39;t study it or catalog it, but it seems to me that there have been quite a bit of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions lately. </p>

<p>I am inclined to rule out an asteroid, as I&#39;m pretty sure NASA would know almost right down to the minute when and where an asteroid would impact. However, the 2 month timespan seems to fit a timeline most seismologists give incoming earthquakes or eruptions. As far as I know (and if I&#39;m wrong please correct me), the predictions for quakes and eruptions are fairly loose, and usually can only be narrowed down to a window of a month or two..</p>

And other radar bings an buzzes are going off; the only time anything I&#39;ve ever written has been picked up and mocked by /greatmindsofreddit is when I posited that Jade Helm might not be to oppress us, but to help us because of a huge earthquake, the Yellowstone Caldera or the revelation that the Pacific has been horrifically irradiated by Fukushima (which is appearing less likely). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uhhhh yeah I don&#39;t know about that buddy.  That sounds pretty stupid and unlikely.  How many times do we have to recycle the same &quot;politician xyz is going to let in every Mexican&quot; and &quot;president xyz is making a play for an illegal third term&quot; before we realize that it is retarded and not happening.  One day this sub is saying &quot;the president has no real power, it&#39;s these other shady guys and the president is a puppet&quot; because that supports a narrative, then the next day to support a different narrative the president suddenly has unlimited power and is going to fundamentally change the country and nobody will notice.  Sure, the same country cracking down on everybody&#39;s freedom and rights and privacy is also going to start erasing its own borders now?  For what reason exactly?  </p>

<p>There are already nations that offer a guaranteed national income, and they&#39;re doing OK. In some respects, better than the USA. That seems like a win for most people and a loss for the uber-wealthy... and if the government serves the uber-wealthy (it does), that is a very illogical plan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Welfare and support programs is not the major thievery that impacting how our tax money is spent. It account for like .01%. You need to look at the major so-called &quot;US&quot; corporations and how they are wiring their money around the world 1,000 times to avoid paying taxes into our system. Think off shore money money, patent tricks, etc. Apple only pays 1.9% tax on &quot;profit outside the US&quot; <a href="https://vimeo.com/67209568">https://vimeo.com/67209568</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you to an extent.  I think companies who keep jobs here in the USA should be allowed tax exemptions which global corporations who move jobs to China aren&#39;t allowed to claim, in fact, those who ship jobs overseas should pay a higher tax rate.  You&#39;re right though, except the Apple example you&#39;ve given is a 1.9% tax rate on profit, this is not the gross tax rate, which is calculated before profits on earnings.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also these phony liberal individuals who preach to us we should be paying our fair share of taxes, while they themselves owe thousands, even millions of dollars in taxes.  People like; Hillary Clinton, Al Sharpton, Melissa Harris-Perry, Toure Neblett, Joy Reid, and others. </p>
