        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I recently watched 9/11 A New Pearl Harbor. I had believed 9/11 had been allowed to happen, or something along those lines, before watching, but after it seems pretty clear that the US government pretty much just demoed the towers while people were inside. Thousands died, and they did it to us. </p>

<p>How do I live knowing this? How do I not scream it from the rooftops? How do I not tell everyone I know? How do I just go about my everyday life knowing our government killed thousands of our own citizens and completely got away with it, and that most people don&#39;t even really know what happened and just bought into the lie? And worst yet, they&#39;re still doing sick stuff all the time, and just getting away with that too. How do I just go to work, pay my taxes, and live in the US knowing that? </p>

<p>It&#39;s seriously eating away at me. I&#39;d really love some help and advice. How do you personally live with this information? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The American Republic is in remnant status. The stage is set for our country eventually devolving into a military dictatorship, and few seem to care. These precedent-setting changes in the law are extremely dangerous and will change American jurisprudence forever if not revised. The beneficial results of our revolt against the King&#39;s abuses are about to be eliminated, and few Members of Congress and few Americans are aware of the seriousness of the situation&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;... Resistance to illegal and unconstitutional usurpation of our rights is required. Each of us must choose which course of action we should take: education, conventional political action, or even peaceful civil disobedience to bring about necessary changes.</p>

<p>But let it not be said that we did nothing. Let not those who love the power of the welfare/warfare state label the dissenters of authoritarianism as unpatriotic or uncaring. Patriotism is more closely linked to dissent than it is to conformity and a blind desire for safety and security. Understanding the magnificent rewards of a free society makes us unbashful in its promotion, fully realizing that maximum wealth is created and the greatest chance for peace comes from a society respectful of individual liberty. &quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been there. It sucks. But after a while, you get past it. You note the patterns, you try to stay ahead of &quot;their&quot; moves. Here&#39;s what&#39;s helped me:</p>

<p>1- I started going back to church, though it took me a while to find a good one. Most aren&#39;t. But the place I go now is very involved in the community, loaded with good people, sincere. Even if you don&#39;t buy all they&#39;re selling -- I don&#39;t -- it&#39;s good to be surrounded by good people who don&#39;t put themselves before everything else. </p>

<p>2- Be social. Get out. Hang out with people. There are still many good people left, even if most have no idea they&#39;re part of a broken, inherently evil system. </p>

<p>3- Find a partner. Being alone only exacerbates the grimness in your mind and soul. </p>

<p>4- Cancel your cable/DirecTV. That&#39;s the #1 way they program people. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a start. Good luck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why stop with cable? TV itself is part of the problem- not THE tv in itself, but the content. They use repetition. The progaganda/mind changing is not &quot;covert&quot;, it is <em>overt</em>. Many do not see the forest for the trees. They ignore the great scheme that is in front of them while they search in futility for tiny insignificant clues. Every time your ears hear a phrase, your eyes view an image, a small &quot;dent&quot; is physically formed in the brain- physically (those are the deep crevices one sees in an old brain say in an autopsy) the more these phrases, images are heard or seen, the deeper those valleys/crevices in the brain become, like how we learn by rote. Having the TV on, or any other tool of the &quot;machine&quot; or even music! will form your thoughts. Pay attention to your emotional response you feel when you read a headline- does it mimic the status quo (not to say that a widely held belief is inherently &#39;wrong&#39;) or is it your own, <em>true</em> feeling? do you find yourself making claims that have no basis in reality? You would not know of it until your idea is challenged. I shall provide an example: I told a friend that 69 California hospitals were shuttered as a direct result of illegal immigr- Oops! &quot;undocumented immigrants&quot; using the facilities and never paying. Friend&#39;s response: &quot;you are racist&quot;. Now, I never mentioned race. I never stated my opinion, anything else. That friend person is a big TV watcher and I hear nothing but crafted responses out of them. I like to think of this friend as a perfect robot and example of what the &quot;powers&quot; consider a very Useful Idiot. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t disagree. I do watch &quot;television&quot; via Netflix, and I sure noticed a bunch of verbal conditioning techniques throughout -- calling social security an &quot;entitlement&quot; over and over again on &quot;House of Cards,&quot; for example. </p>

<p>Yes, we are being programmed all day, every day, and not just by television. Much of it is being done by &quot;useful idiots,&quot; as you state; not people who are consciously guiding us to Lowest Common Denominator status, but have already been brainwashed to the point where they are tools of the establishment. </p>

<p>Thank you for your comment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t burn bridges because of your beliefs right now. You sound like a genuinely curious and skeptical person. I promise you will change your views and realize almost every talking point on this sub is bogus if you keep looking into things and challenging your existing views. Conspiracies aren&#39;t running rampant. 9/11 wasn&#39;t a demo or inside job.  There is a case to be made about American hegemony over the world, but that&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing. I would recommend reading the Grand Chessboard by Zbigniew Bzrezinski. It makes the case for America&#39;s proactive stance that many will call &quot;empire&quot; in a derisive way. </p>

<p>I say all of this from someone who has believed everything you believe, but kept at it until I realized there is a lot more to the story. It started as a hobby interest for me, and has evolved into my career goal. If you want to talk more about this, PM me, or respond here. Either way, I don&#39;t want you to make the mistakes I did. I posted this crap on fb all the time and made people think I&#39;m crazy. Now that I&#39;ve developed my views, plenty of people still think I hate America and all that shit. It kind of sucks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read the Tao De Ching. It reminds me that sitting and worrying won&#39;t change anything, warhawks will always do what they do best. If I can learn to appreciate my surroundings and focus on coexisting with the people around me and making their lives better, that it is the path to happiness, despite all the evil in the world. Trying to wake the world up can prove futile so focus on doing what you do best in life, become the best version of yourself and maybe one day you&#39;ll have a better platform to work towards political change. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like this sentiment. I take to heart a lot of teachings similar to the Tao, but I just often feel like I&#39;m not doing enough, even when I try to do good, love all, spread joy and happiness.

    <div class="md"><p>Spread the knowledge. I think a huge trend is the younger demographic is really starting to wake up. People realize they are being controlled, but a lot of them are afraid to admit it or see what is in plain sight. Try and spread the word wherever you can. You just have to be careful as to not jump to far ahead with someone who is not ready to accept the world as it really is. Start to show someone the light, show them where they can do their own research, and watch the flood gates open. </p>

<p>As I said younger generations are starting to have the same realization as you, and the feeling that nothing can be done. This is not true, the whole idea is that you are supposed to believe nothing can be done.</p>

<p>There&#39;s safety in numbers, and those numbers are shifting to our side rapidly. I think the occupy movement, while disorganized and ultimately strayed from what goals it should have had is a great example of this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone feels this way at first. I have spent nights up in bed shaking in fear as I&#39;ve come to horrible, depressing realizations. But this feeling is natural and it&#39;s good. And you will continue to feel this way if you don&#39;t take action. But the moment you start doing the things you need to do to protect your family and the future generations of your family, you will not only start to feel better, you will feel empowered and in control.</p>

<p>Here are the steps I&#39;ve taken and continue to take to stand up to the oppression and the war that the privileged class is waging on us right now:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>GET YOUR FAMILY ON THE SAME PAGE. Express your views and your feelings to all of them. Explain that you want to have a plan in case anything ever did happen. I did this with my family and although one of my sisters VEHEMENTLY denies everything I say, she respects me calling us all together to make a plan for ANY TYPE of emergency.</p></li>
<li><p>BUY A RIFLE. I was never a gun a person... ever. But since the Snowden leaks, my thoughts on everything have changed. I am not going to say publicly what kind of firearms I use and own but I can assure that every man in my family and around me will be able to protect his family god willing. THIS IS YOUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT. If you don&#39;t exercise that right, don&#39;t expect to keep it forever. And always remember: Throughout history (American revolution, Soviets, Nazis, etc), the moment the government tries to confiscate guns is the moment before they start throwing people in Gulags.</p></li>
<li><p>LIMIT YOUR EXPOSURE TO THE DOLLAR. The writing on the wall is clear. The moment The Fed&#39;s &quot;Quantitative Easing&quot; program stops, we are going to slide back into a depression/recession. The ways I&#39;ve tried to avoid being crippled by this is by exchanging a bunch of my dollars for Canadian dollars, I&#39;ve bought silver coins (still unsure about bitcoins), and I&#39;ve also bought my sisters some precious rocks. The bottom line is to have objects of tangible value on hand. It&#39;s not a guarantee that those 1&#39;s and 0&#39;s on Bank of America&#39;s servers will always be there for you. Don&#39;t break the bank doing this or anything, but have a healthy and sensible amount of insurance.</p></li>
<li><p>HAVE FOOD AND WATER ON HAND. God forbid there is ever a food crisis in this country, you will need a reserve supply, especially if you live in a city. Again, don&#39;t break the bank on canned food and MREs, but having a reserve of food and water is not crazy. It&#39;s being prepared. Whether that&#39;s a tornado, financial collapse, or martial law. People on the internet will call you crazy for stockpiling MREs and jugs of water, the people around you will respect you for it (as long as it&#39;s within reason).</p></li>
<li><p>REFUSE TO LET THE TSA TOUCH KIDS. When you are in the airport and you see the TSA agent touching a kid, SPEAK UP. You don&#39;t have to make a scene but make it known to the strangers around you that this is not OK. They are feeling the same way as you but are afraid to express their feelings in public. Be the first one to say &quot;THIS IS NOT OK&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>SPEAK OUT AND STAND UP. NEVER censor yourself. And NEVER keep your mouth shut because you feel like Big Brother is watching you. That&#39;s what they want. Say what you feel is the truth and be ready to accept the consequences of any of that. If saying that 911 was a fraud is illegal, then THROW ME IN JAIL mother fuckers. They are counting on you to keep your mouth shut and that&#39;s why you have to scream at the top of your lungs.</p></li>
<li><p>ACCEPT DEATH. Accept the fact that it is a real possibility nowadays that you will be murdered for seeking the truth. Michael Hastings was murdered for seeking the truth. Gary Webb was murdered for seeking the truth. William Cooper was murdered for seeking the truth. These are the real heroes and it is our responsibility to carry on their mission. Accept death and be willing to die for what you believe in. Know that your family is standing beside you and that this community is standing beside you and I am standing beside you and Jesus Christ is standing beside you. Understand that all Obama can take from you is your life. He cannot take the truth from you and he cannot take your soul from you. So stand up in the middle of your room right now and scream at the top of your FUCKING LUNGS: &quot;COME AND GET ME MOTHER FUCKER. IM READY TO DIE FOR WHAT I BELIEVE IN AND I WILL DIE FIGHTING FOR IT. GIVE ME LIBERTY OR GIVE ME DEATH&quot; That kind of shit always makes me feel better lol.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I hope that helps. I could go on and on about forming a states rights group in your community, confronting and breaking up DHS checkpoints, contacting your local police departments and asking their protocol for a Martial Law order etc. But that&#39;s enough for now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your advice. I don&#39;t think I could ever own a gun, as I believe in nonviolence, however naive it may seem.</p>

<p>How do you talk about these issues with people? Most people, even those I thought were open minded, tend to shut down and just get angry and don&#39;t want to hear it, so I tend not to talk about it with people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All the guns I own are non violent. They are tools of self defense and nothing more. Violence is an aspect of human nature whether we like it or not. Violence can be done by you, done to you, or stopped by you. The ONLY violence I would ever participate in is that which stops violence being done to me. Plus,  these people who are playing puppet master do NOT want you to own a firearm. Having one is sort of a socially acceptable way to say &quot;up yours&quot; even if you never need to use it. </p>

<p>As for how to talk to people, that can be difficult depending on the person who you are speaking with. I typically listen to all the reasons they believes what they do then I point out and inconsistencies in their argument followed by giving PURELY FACTUAL counter argument. It&#39;s important to avoid anything that can be spun as conjecture as this only discredits your argument and your ideas. I also try and point out why it is understandable they believe the lies they do. You want to avoid making the other person feel stupid at all cost. Instead try and make them feel intelligent, but unfairly tricked by The Big Evil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh! Another thing I use to discuss these topics is start the conversation by stating a factual point in a way that makes it seem to be common knowledge. Odds are they will agree to avoid looking stupid and then disagree by making their own statement. After they present their statement say something like &quot;huh, I guess I never really considered that. I&#39;d love to hear more!&quot; This makes them comfortable in sharing their beliefs and makes them believe you aren&#39;t simply talking with them to disagree with everything they say.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry I keep adding more, but I keep thinking of tactics that have helped me wake others.... While discussing these topics avoid using the terms &quot;they&quot; and &quot;the goverment&quot; to indicate who you believe was responsible for these atrocities.  I use &quot;small groups of corrupt men within the government&quot; and &quot;those who would financially benefit from the tragedy&quot;. These less ambiguous terms seem to make my ideas much more digestible to someone with different opinions from my own.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t talk about it with people who don&#39;t think 911 could ever have been a conspiracy. They&#39;ll just laugh and deny it and think that you are crazy. What did you think of people who said this kind of thing before you were awake?</p>

<p>Find some friends that think the same way. Talk about it with them. In the meantime, support the causes, websites and people who you believe in. Have you ever heard of William Cooper? He wrote the &quot;bible&quot; on this stuff in <em>1991</em>. The book is called Behold a Pale Horse and you can listen to it hear: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w4oyP6Eq6Y">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w4oyP6Eq6Y</a> . </p>

Think of all of the peasants and serfs who were born into their place in this world, lived a humble life, and then died. Do you think their lives were wasted because they didn&#39;t take on the powers that be of their time and try to become kings themselves? No, of course not. They lived, loved, and died the best they could given their circumstances. All of the evil people who are participating in various conspiracies will die someday too. We are all equally mortal. Just know that your life is all that is truly yours. Rights and freedoms are abstract things, but your life is a treasure you must protect. Try to be happy despite the evil in the world and you are not letting them win.</p>

<p>Edit: I also just wanted to reiterate what someone else had already said. Be careful where you get your information. There is information out there that is super misleading and outright BS. I will probably offend people with this, but I stay away from people like Alex Jones, Dahboo7 and David Icke. After a couple years of narrowing down people to get info from I still am subscribed to the Corbet Report. This subreddit is usually pretty good at pointing out BS as well. </p>

<p>If even a fraction of the conspiracy theories discussed here are true, the only solutions take the form of major events.

    <div class="md"><p>the play of life on the planet earth is just that - a play</p>

<p>it&#39;s all part of a game of experiences that is natural in the course of nature developing itself / life developing life - which is what we are (living molecules / energy self-organizing into individuated units of potential and action and perception, etc).</p>

<p>You have to understand that there are greater forces at play then the simple human drama point of view would suggest, and what happens will be decided by the behavior of the many -- not the actions or attempted actions / plans of  a few. You live by being part of &#39;the many&#39; and trying to do good and make the world you live in personally the best ways it can be for yourself and the others around you. </p>

<p>you are the same as &#39;the conspirators&#39;, you&#39;re just another unit of life playing out a different set of experiences than the ones they are and you have your own feelings and motivations.</p>

<p>life is still very beautiful, even the &#39;dark twisted evil&#39; ones, you don&#39;t have to be one of those, and you don&#39;t have to let fear or bad feelings color your perception of life or the world. Don&#39;t take everything so seriously. The people involved in bad things are just people like you who are making choices. You can make good choices of your own instead and make life good or better instead of worse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>what do you really &quot;know&quot;, though?</p>

<p>the people involved in the things you are talking about are thinking that they are advancing the social order of human civilization on Earth (like how the habsburg family for instance, the dynasty that held the &#39;king of the romans&#39; title for almost 5 centuries in the Holy Roman Empire - is still around today with it&#39;s noble status and is championing &#39;european integration&#39; ...which is a good thing, not a bad thing) - and they&#39;re probably correct in their thinking - so don&#39;t worry about it. They aren&#39;t <em>just</em> &quot;evil&quot; - you think all those people involved in the higher orders of society are just &quot;choosing to all be evil together&quot; for laughs? No, they have higher ideals and intellectual principles that they are trying to serve.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just like we had all those &quot;conspiracies&quot; in ancient Rome, and political scandals, and wars, and lies, and traitors, and blahblahblah -- long story short, civilization organizes and becomes what it is today where we are all able to connect and share our thoughts instantly via magical glowing screens with <em>cables transmitting our thoughts on beams of light carried through the ground and the data connection running in and out of all of our homes</em>, and we have enough of everything here, and we&#39;re out in space and beginning to act as stewards of the planet.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t worry about it. They are doing their thing, you do your thing. You don&#39;t need to change THE world, you just need to change YOUR world, and <em>that</em> will change &quot;the&quot; world. You won&#39;t help anyone by being upset, scared, or angry about what George Bush does. All that stuff is just a distraction from your own real life.</p>

<p>just like the people who started google - they changed <em>their world</em>, and it changed <em>the</em> world. imagine where we&#39;d all be if they had sat around in grad school reading too much about political conspiracies and being unhappy.</p>

<p>Overall these people seem to be working towards a world civilization and getting the kinks out required invading the middle east (where the islamic world remains separate legally and financially from the west, while holding major resources like the poppy farms and oil), which required inflaming the US and west, which they accomplished or allowed to happen or promoted. It&#39;s all towards something bigger - like a higher level of civilization on the earth among human beings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a religious person, but I&#39;ve read the bible and there is definitely a lot of strange coincidences and parallels in there. I&#39;m paraphrasing but in Revelations it says something along the lines of &quot;be weary of those that call themselves Jews, but are really a synagogue of Satan.&quot; Which is essentially the modern state of Israel summed up in a sentence. Also in Revelations, the description of The Great Harlot matches the original design of the Statue of (Isis)Liberty.  The original blueprint had purple robes with a goblet raised to the sky, sitting on top of the many waters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am of the opinion that 9/11 is not a big enough lie to expose to get people to really stand up.  Certainly a government committing such an act against its own people and using it to take away their freedoms and as a justification for wars should be enough.</p>

<p>While you are learning about these things you have to be very careful.  Not everything you read on this subreddit is true.  Not everything you saw in that movie is true.  Disinformation, misinformation, psyops, cointelpro.  All of these things exist and you must wade through them in order to get to a picture of what is actually happening.  Remember that consensus opinion can and is manufactured.  Do not listen to people who give you easy answers from positions of authority.  People who cite sources and tell you to verify those sources, those people you give the time of day.  Then you verify their claims.</p>

<p>What is needed is a lie that is so fundamental to our entire existance that the revealing of the scope of the lie causes people to realize the scope of the problem.  9/11 when viewed in isolation is not enough, it needs context.  It needs hundreds of years of history to really be understood.  Its difficult to hold most people&#39;s attention for long enough to explain the context properly.</p>

<p>BUT, there is a lie that is so profound, so in your face.  This lie can be proven through simple math, observation and simple experiments that anyone can do.  The riducule heaped upon those who know the truth about this lie is a campaign of desperation because they know what its exposure could mean.  When you consider it yourself for the first time it seems ridiculous, but you have to get past your programming and be able to consider the argument on its merits.</p>

<p>The earth is flat.  It can be proven.  You can prove it to yourself.  Start here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R77j9rUuky4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R77j9rUuky4</a> Visit the sites in the description afterwards.
Also, be aware that &quot;The Flat Earth Society&quot; is disinformation.  They make claims that are silly to make the whole thing look silly.  This is not a silly topic, it is hugely important.  Consider the arguments on their merits and trust yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Note that the below text is not my own, but the answer to this question from the author of that video.  He is much better spoken than I am.</p>

<p>The Sun and Moon spotlights are perpetually hovering over and parallel to the surface of the Earth. From our vantage point, due to the Law of Perspective, the day/night luminaries appear to rise up the Eastern horizon, curve peaking high overhead, and then sink below the Western horizon. They do not escape to the underside of the Flat-Earth as one might imagine, but rather rotate concentric clockwise circles around the circumference from tropic to tropic. The appearance of rising, peaking and setting is due to the common Law of Perspective where tall objects appear high overhead when nearby, but at a distance gradually lower towards the vanishing point.</p>

<p>“Although the Sun is at all times above and parallel to the Earth’s surface, he appears to ascend the firmament from morning until noon, and to descend and sink below the horizon at evening. This arises from a simple and everywhere visible law of perspective. A flock of birds, when passing over a flat or marshy country, always appears to descend as it recedes; and if the flock is extensive, the first bird appears lower, or nearer to the horizon than the last. The farthest light in a row of lamps appears the lowest, although each one has the same altitude. Bearing these phenomena in mind, it will easily be seen how the Sun, although always parallel to the surface of the Earth, must appear to ascend when approaching, and descend after leaving the meridian or noon-day position.” -Dr. Samuel Rowbotham, “Earth Not a Globe, 2nd Edition” (85)</p>

<p>“What can be more common than the observation that, standing at one end of a long row of lamp-posts, those nearest to us seem to be the highest; and those farthest away the lowest; whilst, as we move along towards the opposite end of the series, those which we approach seem to get higher, and those we are leaving behind appear to gradually become lower … It is an ordinary effect of perspective for an object to appear lower and lower as the observer goes farther and farther away from it. Let any one try the experiment of looking at a light-house, church spire, monument, gas lamp, or other elevated object, from a distance of only a few yards, and notice the angle at which it is observed. On going farther away, the angle under which it is seen will diminish, and the object will appear lower and lower as the distance of the observer increases, until, at a certain point, the line of sight to the object, and the apparently uprising surface of the earth upon or over which it stands, will converge to the angle which constitutes the ‘vanishing point’ or the horizon; beyond which it will be invisible.” -Dr. Samuel Rowbotham, “Zetetic Astronomy, Earth Not a Globe!” (230-1)</p>

<p>A telescope cannot bring a flat 2D light back into view once it has receded beyond the vanishing line of perspective, so you cannot see the Sun with a telescope at night time, and the Sun goes beyond the horizon because it is the vanishing line of perspective from your vantage point, not because it is descended below the &quot;ball-Earth.&quot; </p>

<p>Do you live in a city or a suburb, house or apartment/condo? If you live in the suburbs, plant a garden and start growing your own food. Plant an apple tree or grapes to make wine or cider (if you drink). Also, you can brew your own beer (if you drink) and not give corporations your money. If there is hunting land around you, learn to hunt for your own meat or if there is a lake/river near you, learn to fish. Look into solar panels to slowly migrate off the grid. <a href="http://www.teslamotors.com/powerwall">The Tesla powerwall</a> could really shift the paradigm of home energy.</p>

<p>There are a lot of things we can do to migrate off this corrupt system, it just takes a little effort.</p>
