<p>I realize you&#39;re doing damage control here, but at least try to formulate an actual argument, not a non sequitur/strawman. </p>

<p>Many jews died in slave labor camps, as well as POWs, gypsies, gays, and all other sorts of people.</p>

<p>There is loads of evidence for all of that. The point is, there was never an intentional extermination program of any human beings, as the facts clearly show. The majority of the deaths were due to thyphus and starvation.</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t do anything other than throw out strawmen arguments and non sequiturs, then I will stop replying to you.</p>

<p>It&#39;s actually hilarious, you ask me for &quot;peer reviewed sources&quot; and then when I point out there aren&#39;t any (even for your opinion that the holocaust was intentional extermination of jews) then you simply pull out a strawman argument. That shit might fly in the regular subs, but isn&#39;t gonna pass here. </p>

<p>Oh, and on a side note, if you&#39;re going to brigade me, don&#39;t make it so fucking obvious. My above post was at +4 points and it is as of today 3 days old. Then you ask me a question about it and I lose 4 karma instantly after answering it. </p>

<p>Because i like proving people wrong when they are wrong, such as you in this instance</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Were any Jews put into gas chambers or simply killed for being Jewish?</p>

<p>Nope, no one was put into gas chambers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ill let other people who have actually studied this, please try to debunk if you can</p>

<p>How do we know the Nazis used gas chambers to kill Jews en masse? The same way we prove the Holocaust in general--a convergence of evidence from various sources:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Written documents--Orders for Zyklon-B gas, blueprints and orders for building materials for the crematoria, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Eyewitness testimony--Sonderkommando diaries, confessions of guards and commandants, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Photographs--Not only of the camps, but especially interesting are the secret photos taken of the burning of bodies that were smuggled out of Auschwitz.</p></li>
<li><p>The camps themselves--forensic tests have now been conducted demonstrating the homicidal use of both the gas chambers and the crematoria for the express purpose of exterminating large numbers of prisoners (Pressac, 1989; Pressac and Van Pelt, 1994).</p></li>
<li><p>Negative evidence--we have documentation of the numbers of prisoners shipped to the various camps, the numbers that were transferred, and the number liberated. The difference between the latter with the former two figures gives an approximation of the numbers who died or were killed (see Hilberg, 1961).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Once these historical data have been linked together the burden of proof is on the revisionists to disentangle them, both individually and as a whole.</p>

<p>To corroborate these photos we have eyewitness accounts. Judith Berg, the survivor who spent seven months in Auschwitz and who appeared with me on Donahue, confirmed the mass burning of bodies. Edith Gleick, also on the show, gave me a verbal description of the sorting and separation process that happened at the Auschwitz train platform that very nicely matches the photos of the Hungarian Jews presented above. And we have thousands of accounts like these.</p>

<p>And, of course, we do not just have survivor accounts. We also have the confessions of guards, like SS-Unterscharfuehrer Pery Broad, captured on May 6, 1945, by the British in their zone of occupation. Broad began work at Auschwitz in 1942 in the &quot;Political Section,&quot; and stayed there until the liberation of the camp in January, 1945. During his capture he worked as an interpreter for the British and in the process wrote a memoir, which was passed on to the British Intelligence Service in July, 1945. That December he declared under oath that what he wrote was true. On September 29, 1947, the document was translated into English and used at the Nuremberg Trials regarding the gas chambers as mechanisms of mass murder. Later that year he was released. In April, 1959, Broad was called to testify in a trial on the SS of Auschwitz, and he acknowledged the authorship of the memoir, confirmed its validity, and retracted nothing.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Are you copypasting out a JIDF handbook or something? It was already explained to you that many many people died in those camps. Mostly due to starvation and typhus. That does not indicate an intentional program of genocide.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Once these historical data have been linked together the burden of proof is on the revisionists to disentangle them, both individually and as a whole.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, the burden of proof is on you to prove something happened. You don&#39;t put the burden of proof on someone with nothing but eyewitness testimony (hearsay is inadmissible in a court of law) and one historian&#39;s word which has been debunked countless times. </p>

<p>The evidence for the opposite, <strong>the physical IMPOSSIBILITY OF BURNING SO MANY BODIES IN SUCH A SHORT TIME SPAN, the amount of time needed to degas before clearing out bodies and burning them, it&#39;s physically impossible for the numbers claimed by conventional historians. Actual review of the blueprints and crematoriums show this clearly to be the case.</strong></p>

<blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s hilarious you bring up people that have already been discredited. Every single eyewitness account that has been put under scrutiny finds them to have lied, or have seriously omitted information, the links in my above post clearly lay this out.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes, classic case. A guard given a chance at immunity if he corroborates the official narrative. Nothing new here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>is that a good reason in your opinion?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is never a good reason to do such a thing to people. The point is there was never an intentional genocide, particularly of jews.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>just posted evidence of gas chambers, will wait for your rebuttal</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You didn&#39;t post a single snippet of evidence of gas chambers apart from hearsay extracted at gunpoint essentially (guards) and jews (not exactly an unbiased source).</p>

<p>The only remotely possibe &quot;evidence&quot; you have is the easily debunkable Pressac and Van Pelt:</p>

<p>Totally discredited and debunked, thoroughly. You didn&#39;t bother to check any of my links did you. Next:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How did you discredit it?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Negative evidence--we have documentation of the numbers of prisoners shipped to the various camps, the numbers that were transferred, and the number liberated. The difference between the latter with the former two figures gives an approximation of the numbers who died or were killed (see Hilberg, 1961).</p>

<p>Are you copypasting out a JIDF handbook or something? It was already explained to you that many many people died in those camps. Mostly due to starvation and typhus. That does not indicate an intentional program of genocide.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lol JIDF handbook, no your right it doesn&#39;t. But testimony from the killers saying what their mission was, does </p>

<blockquote>
<p>To corroborate these photos we have eyewitness accounts. Judith Berg, the survivor who spent seven months in Auschwitz and who appeared with me on Donahue, confirmed the mass burning of bodies. Edith Gleick, also on the show, gave me a verbal description of the sorting and separation process that happened at the Auschwitz train platform that very nicely matches the photos of the Hungarian Jews presented above. And we have thousands of accounts like these.</p>

<p>It&#39;s hilarious you bring up people that have already been discredited. Every single eyewitness account that has been put under scrutiny finds them to have lied, or have seriously omitted information, the links in my above post clearly lay this out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are saying she has been discredited: where is your evidence of this assertion. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And, of course, we do not just have survivor accounts. We also have the confessions of guards, like SS-Unterscharfuehrer Pery Broad, captured on May 6, 1945, by the British in their zone of occupation. Broad began work at Auschwitz in 1942 in the &quot;Political Section,&quot; and stayed there until the liberation of the camp in January, 1945. During his capture he worked as an interpreter for the British and in the process wrote a memoir, which was passed on to the British Intelligence Service in July, 1945. That December he declared under oath that what he wrote was true. On September 29, 1947, the document was translated into English and used at the Nuremberg Trials regarding the gas chambers as mechanisms of mass murder. Later that year he was released. In April, 1959, Broad was called to testify in a trial on the SS of Auschwitz, and he acknowledged the authorship of the memoir, confirmed its validity, and retracted nothing.</p>

<p>Yes, classic case. A guard given a chance at immunity if he corroborates the official narrative. Nothing new here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again you have no evidence for your assertion </p>

<blockquote>
<p>is that a good reason in your opinion?</p>

<p>There is never a good reason to do such a thing to people. The point is there was never an intentional genocide, particularly of jews.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First logical thing you have said </p>

<p>I eagerly await your reply. You are about out of ammo at this point. Your eyewitnesses are discredited, the physics behind the gas chambers/crematoriums are debunked, what else are you going to throw out? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lets see, you posted sources from</p>

<ul>
<li>Institute for Historical Review</li>
</ul>

<p><em>The Institute for Historical Review (IHR), founded in 1978, is an organization primarily devoted to publishing and promoting books and essays that deny established facts concerning the Nazi genocide of Jews.[2][3][4][5][6] It is considered by many scholars as the world&#39;s leading Holocaust denial organization.[2][7][8] Critics have accused the Institute of antisemitism and having links to neo-Nazi organizations. The Institute published the non-peer-reviewed Journal of Historical Review until 2002, but now disseminates its materials through its website and via email. The Institute is affiliated with the Legion for the Survival of Freedom and Noontide Press.[9]</em></p>

<p>Lol, <strong>NEXT</strong></p>

<p>This is what IHR says</p>

<blockquote>
<p>None. The only evidence is the postwar testimony of individual &quot;survivors.&quot; This testimony is contradictory, and no &quot;survivor&quot; claims to have actually witnessed any gassing. There are no contemporaneous documents and no hard evidence whatsoever: no mounds of ashes, no crematoria capable of disposing of millions of corpses, no piles of clothes, no human soap, no lamp shades made of human skin, no records, no credible demographic statistics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Goebbels&#39; diary, for example, was barely rescued from being sold as 7,000 pages of scrap paper, but buried in the scattered manuscript were several telling entries (as translated in Lochner, The Goebbels Diaries, 1948, pp. 86, 147-148):</p>

<p>February 14, 1942: The Führer once again expressed his determination to clean up the Jews in Europe pitilessly. There must be no squeamish sentimentalism about it. The Jews have deserved the catastrophe that has now overtaken them. Their destruction will go hand in hand with the destruction of our enemies. We must hasten this process with cold ruthlessness.</p>

<p>March 27, 1942: The procedure is a pretty barbaric one and not to be described here more definitely. Not much will remain of the Jews. On the whole it can be said that about 60 per cent of them will have to be liquidated whereas only 40 per cent can be used for forced labor.</p>

<ul>
<li>Nazi Testimony</li>
</ul>

<p>Regarding postwar testimony from Nazis, were they all tortured into confessing to heinous crimes which they supposedly did not commit? This might be believable if only a few Nazis were captured after the war, or maybe if some had courageously stood up in court and shouted to the world about the supposed attempt to silence them. But hundreds testified regarding the Holocaust, in trials dating from late 1945 until the 1960s.</p>

<p>Many of these Nazis testified as witnesses and were not accused of crimes. What was the basis for their supposed coercion?</p>

<ul>
<li>Further</li>
</ul>

<p>What supposed coercion could reach across four decades, to force former SS-Untersturmführer Dr. Hans Münch to give an interview, against the will of his family, on Swedish television? In the 1981 interview, he talked about Auschwitz:</p>

<p>Interviewer: Isn&#39;t the ideology of extermination contrary to a doctor&#39;s ethical values?
Münch: Yes, absolutely. There is no discussion. But I lived in that environment, and I tried in every possible way to avoid accepting it, but I had to live with it. What else could I have done? And I wasn&#39;t confronted with it directly until the order came that I and my superior and another one had to take part in the exterminations since the camp&#39;s doctors were overloaded and couldn&#39;t cope with it.
Interviewer: I must ask something. Doubters claim that &quot;special treatment&quot; could mean anything. It didn&#39;t have to be extermination.
Münch: &quot;Special treatment&quot; in the terminology of the concentration camp means physical extermination. If it was a question of more than a few people, where nothing else than gassing them was worthwhile, they were gassed.
Interviewer: &quot;Special treatment&quot; was gassing?
Münch: Yes, absolutely.</p>

<ul>
<li>Moarr Please</li>
</ul>

<p>And what supposed coercion could reach across four decades, to force former SS-Unterscharführer Franz Suchomel into giving an interview for the film Shoah? Speaking under (false) promises of anonymity, he told of the crimes committed at the Treblinka death camp (from the book Shoah, Claude Lanzmann, 1985, p. 54):</p>

<p>Interviewer: You are a very important eyewitness, and you can explain what Treblinka was.
Suchomel: But don&#39;t use my name.
Interviewer: No, I promised. All right, you&#39;ve arrived at Treblinka.
Suchomel: So Stadie, the sarge, showed us the camps from end to end. Just as we went by, they were opening the gas-chamber doors, and people fell out like potatoes. Naturally, that horrified and appalled us. We went back and sat down on our suitcases and cried like old women. Each day one hundred Jews were chosen to drag the corpses to the mass graves. In the evening the Ukrainians drove those Jews into the gas chambers or shot them. Every day!</p>

<ul>
<li>Gas Chambers</li>
</ul>

<p>Regarding the gassing vans, precursors to the gas chambers, we find, for example, a top secret document from SS Untersturmführer Becker to SS Obersturmbannführer Rauff (from Nazi Conspiracy and Aggression, 1946, Vol. I, pp. 999-1001):</p>

<p>If it has rained for instance for only one half hour, the van cannot be used because it simply skids away. It can only be used in absolutely dry weather. It is only a question now whether the van can only be used standing at the place of execution. First the van has to be brought to that place, which is possible only in good weather. ...</p>

<p>The application of gas usually is not undertaken correctly. In order to come to an end as fast as possible, the driver presses the accelerator to the fullest extent. By doing that the persons to be executed suffer death from suffocation and not death by dozing off as was planned. My directions now have proved that by correct adjustment of the levers death comes faster and the prisoners fall asleep peacefully.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>HITLER</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>In a letter dated 1919 Hitler mentions that part of the ultimate aim of a strong national government must &quot;unshakably be the removal of the Jews&quot;.[7][8]</p>

<p>Once I really am in power, my first and foremost task will be the annihilation of the Jews. As soon as I have the power to do so, I will have gallows built in rows—at the Marienplatz in Munich, for example—as many as traffic allows. Then the Jews will be hanged indiscriminately, and they will remain hanging until they stink; they will hang there as long as the principles of hygiene permit. As soon as they have been untied, the next batch will be strung up, and so on down the line, until the last Jew in Munich has been exterminated. Other cities will follow suit, precisely in this fashion, until all Germany has been completely cleansed of Jews.[9]</p>

So it would be weird.
Sadly, having perverts targeting children is all too common, and so, doesn&#39;t qualify as weird.

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Only the existence of a field of force can account for the motions of the bodies as observed, and its assumption dispenses with space curvature. All literature on this subject is futile and destined to oblivion. So are all attempts to explain the workings of the universe without recognizing the existence of the ether and the indispensable function it plays in the phenomena.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My second discovery was of a physical truth of the greatest importance. As I have searched the entire scientific records in more than a half dozen languages for a long time without finding the least anticipation, I consider myself the original discoverer of this truth, which can be expressed by the statement: There is no energy in matter other than that received from the environment.&quot; — Nikola Tesla</p>

<p>The Dynamic Theory of Gravity of Nikola Tesla explains the relation between gravitation and electromagnetic force as a unified field theory.</p>

<p>Tesla rediscovered the knowledge of the ancients and therefore must be suppressed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was at the American History Museum last week. 
There is a large walk through of the history of the development of power in America and goes through a lot of the competition between Edison and Tesla. I remember a quote from there with Tesla gazing over Niagara Falls and proclaiming that he will <a href="http://teslasociety.com/dc/s6.jpg">one day harness that power.</a></p>

<p>The exhibit was more heavily weighted on Edison though.</p>

<p>If your friend likes Tesla, I would suggest the <a href="http://www.msichicago.org/">Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago</a> and to go to <a href="http://teslasociety.com/niagarafalls.htm">Niagara Falls in NY</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Such a shame.  Tesla invented/discovered AC (Alternating Current) power.  Edison wanted to make all of his power plants run off DC current which would have required them to be much closer to customer locations.  You never hear history books credit Tesla with this, it is always kinda suggested that Edison invented all that.</p>

<p>Eventually Edison had to switch to AC power to distribute his electrical grid.  History books still never give credit to Tesla about this either.  They make it sound like Edison eventually invented AC power too.  Fuckers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It all started with Einstein&#39;s paper on the photoelectric effect, that was the beginning of the end of the aether. Then bit by bit the electric force was replaced with physical parts. Electrons flowing through pipes, dielectrics turned into insulators that block electrons, lines of force are written out of the equations; everything gets turned into particles.  Of course the quantum car mechanics have special dispensation where their particles get to exhibit &quot;non-locality&quot; which is just a weasel worded way to say spooky action at a distance. </p>

<p>If you want some clarity on electricity then read Steinmetz, Heaviside, Maxwell, Faraday, Tesla. They are the guys responsible for inventing all the things that work. Meanwhile physicists have wasted close to a century and trillions of dollars in resources in pursuit of their holy particles and magic fusion powers with the excuse always being &#39;any day now&#39;. Just modern clergymen telling us the second coming of science is at hand. </p>

<p>Of course I don&#39;t have a degree is physics so how could a lowly peasant such as myself interpret the scripture of the prophet Einstein? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nearly anything I say on the matter will be regarded as either crazy, stupid, bad reasoning, or easily dismissed by the official explanation. So instead I&#39;ll quote Oliver Heaviside, &quot;A perfect conductor is a perfect obstructor.&quot; His meaning is that the electric field is obstructed by the metallic, rather than absorbed and conducted through it. The metal acts as a wave guide. The modern explanation completely breaks down when trying to explain antenna.</p>

<p>Of course someone will say that electron flow is simply the explanation they use for high school textbooks. They&#39;ve upgraded the explanation to be that even smaller particles are what actually flow and electrons are simply charge carriers. So now I turn to Charles P. Stienmetz from his book Electric Discharges, Waves and Impulses. &quot;Unfortunately, to a large extent in dealing with dielectric fields the prehistoric conception of the electrostatic charge (electron) on the conductor still exists, and by its use destroys the analogy between the two components of the electric field, the magnetic and the dielectric, and makes the consideration of dielectric fields unnecessarily complicated. There is obviously no more sense in thinking of the capacity current as current which charges the conductor with a quantity of electricity, than there is of speaking of the inductance voltage as charging the conductor with a quantity of magnetism. But the latter conception, together with the notion of a quantity of magnetism, etc., has vanished since Faraday&#39;s representation of the magnetic field by lines of force.&quot;</p>

<p>Of course the magneto dielectric lines of force are not considered to be a thing anymore, it is all homogeneous charge with clever explanations on what they are doing but it never adds. You don&#39;t have to investigate capacitors very deeply before you realize the standard explanation is untenable. Of course it doesn&#39;t take long for someone to mention quantum mechanics, they use it to explain away everything. Faraday&#39;s Paradox is a good example of that.</p>

<p>Of course I&#39;m not asking you to take my word for it. I&#39;m asking you to just listen to the electrical giants that figured everything out. There&#39;s tons and tons of material to go through. It&#39;ll take about 8 years to even begin to grasp what these guys were on to using nothing but brass and wood.</p>

<p>The really strange thing is each one of these guys live&#39;s were destroyed because of their research. Heaviside was literally stoned to death and his books were censored by the royal society of engineers. So good luck.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re even a tiny bit curious after reading that look up Eric P Dollard if you want more depth without delving into archaic textbooks from 1903.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>most of the currnet math/physics around electromagnetics are based on the simplified Maxwell equations. </p>

<p>for example Gauss&#39;s law states there can not be monopoles but they have just found that out to be an incorrect assumption (was posted in the last week to r/science iirc)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Limitations for a theory of electromagnetism</p>

<p>While Maxwell&#39;s equations (along with the rest of classical electromagnetism) are extraordinarily successful at explaining and predicting a variety of phenomena, they are not exact, but approximations. In some special situations, they can be noticeably inaccurate. Examples include extremely strong fields (see Euler–Heisenberg Lagrangian) and extremely short distances (see vacuum polarization). Moreover, various phenomena occur in the world even though Maxwell&#39;s equations predict them to be impossible, such as &quot;nonclassical light&quot; and quantum entanglement of electromagnetic fields (see quantum optics). Finally, any phenomenon involving individual photons, such as the photoelectric effect, Planck&#39;s law, the Duane–Hunt law, single-photon light detectors, etc., would be difficult or impossible to explain if Maxwell&#39;s equations were exactly true, as Maxwell&#39;s equations do not involve photons. For the most accurate predictions in all situations, Maxwell&#39;s equations have been superseded by quantum electrodynamics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>while im not saying electrons don&#39;t flow (they don&#39;t their charge does) the core of the entire field is based on incomplete work. after tesla, working on that sort of thing has been equated to being crazy</p>
