It creates a paranoia to where one day I fear I might just turn up missing from everyday life or even die... I know I&#39;m not a high-value dissenter of the government, I&#39;m small-fry, but I still feel my disappearance could so easily happen. Are you ever afraid? How do we ensure nothing happens to us? And if something does, how might we reveal the truth to our &quot;disappearance&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The parinoia you are experiencing is most likely a result of programming you have received watching &quot;watering hole&quot; conspiracy videos. If any clandestine body wanted to disappear you, or even gaslight you, you wouldn&#39;t even be able to post to here to reddit. It may look like reddit, but it will be a fake. You will come to understand that everything you have experienced is plausibly deniable, people you know may start to act differently to you, this could be because of direct influences or uncauncious ones. My advice, question what you believe to be true, people may be coming to kill you -or- it could be something else, it could be just you. Keep a cool head.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The BS is part of the game. You got to consider this spiritual side of things, where as a clandestine cooperative of evil people probably don&#39;t have you on their radar, spiritual nasties have all the time in the world to fuck with you. If you are feeling that sort of thing well up in you, it is probably an influence of one of the badies trying to latch on.</p>

So what do you use for research then? I watch a lot of documentaries/ Wiki leaks/ speeches, and always draw my own conclusions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I pretty much avoid youtube documentaries. I find that stuff to be highly speculative and paranoid <em>at best.</em> Wikipedia is a good start but mostly I just read A LOT. Books, all kinds of non fiction about sociology, world history, politics, war. Other than Chomsky and RAW I try to stay away from cult of personaity authors, however even those are acceptable if you go in knowing you won&#39;t take anything seriously and you&#39;ll draw your own conclusions. </p>

<p>From time to time we all group source different reading lists.. lots of books out there that will get you up and going. But even mainstream media can be enlightening if you read more than one source, cross reference, check sources and ask questions.  In the end a lot of the so called arcane and obscure information you find out in these youtube vids turns out to be pretty well known amongst most people at a uni level or who have read enough books. </p>

<p>What is more disheartening than the fear of being spied on or attacked is that a lot of people know what is really going on and they just don&#39;t care. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you have anything to worry about. Think about it: hypothetically, if these nefarious clandestine groups didn&#39;t like the idea of people reading particular information or watch particular videos, don&#39;t you think they&#39;d be more apt to destroy the information and videos and disappear the people creating them? </p>

<p>I mean, I don&#39;t think you&#39;d have to worry about anything anyway, as I think most of it is either misinformed paranoid people or disinformation peddlers trying to make a few bucks by making for-profit blogs and videos. But that&#39;s just my opinion. </p>

<p>Either way, no reason to be paranoid. They want you paranoid, that way you&#39;ll keep coming back for more. And become more paranoid. Rinse and repeat. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I&#39;m sure the drones that &quot;murdered American citizens without trial&quot; were targeting them for listening to Corbett or watching Dark Journalist videos. They&#39;re also killing people like Corbett and Dark Journalist so they can&#39;t get the truth out. That&#39;s why their stuff isn&#39;t online anymore. Because the government won&#39;t let it be. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny you should ask, was thinking of making a post reminding the readers of this sub that some of the posters here are in danger of just that. While its easy to read and up/down vote articles or simple dismiss them out of hand, for the poster it could be the final straw. I have had two attempts on my life that i know of and suspect one more. And there is no one to complain to or report to. I am so vigilant when i am out, i take my personnel security very seriously. But it doesn&#39;t stop me, in fact i push back harder. Never underestimate what the authorities can do, believe me they can and do anything and your friends, families and lovers are targets too. So always ask yourself, is it worth it. They want silence and conformity or they can make your life hell.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pretty sure they watch people who are powerful enough to make a significant change in their immediate surroundings (communities, towns etc). I don&#39;t fall under that category so I&#39;m not that worried. However that thought often crosses my mind. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I&#39;m sure the drones that &quot;murdered American citizens without trial&quot; were targeting them for listening to Corbett or watching Dark Journalist videos. They&#39;re also killing people like Corbett and Dark Journalist so they can&#39;t get the truth out. That&#39;s why their stuff isn&#39;t online anymore. Because the government won&#39;t let it be. </p>

<p>The rest of the stuff you said really doesn&#39;t have any relevance to what we&#39;re talking about (people being disappeared), so I&#39;m just going to assume it was put in for shock / be afraid value. My jaw is so agape right now, thanks for shocking and frightening me with old news.</p>
