        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Let me just give you some bullet points, and yes, this is all 100% true. I didn&#39;t hear this story from a friend and I didn&#39;t read about it second hand. I lived it.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The door to my bedroom was kicked down around 3am when I was 16 and I was thrown into an unmarked van and driven for 20 hours to an undisclosed location in the Maine woods.</p></li>
<li><p>I was brought to a place called Elan, a place that was open for almost 40 years. Thousands of children and adults went through Elan and it wasn&#39;t closed until after 2010. So anyone who tells you that &quot;a conspiracy with thousands of people involved&quot; is impossible, they are full of shit.</p></li>
<li><p>We had &quot;the Ring&quot;, a part of &quot;the Program&quot; that forced children to fight each other bloody. It was sold as &quot;good vs evil&quot; and the child fighting &quot;for evil&quot; had to fight round after round with 3 or more children, one at a time. So as each round ended, a rested child was brought in to fight in the &quot;evil&quot; one who had no time to rest between rounds.</p></li>
<li><p>We had &quot;General Meetings&quot; where an entire house of children (about 60) was forced to scream at one child. This usually lasted about 40 minutes. It was called &quot;getting your feelings off&quot; and it was mandatory. If you did not join the mob, you were next. Some days we had 7 or 8 GM&#39;s in a row.</p></li>
<li><p>We had &quot;the Corner&quot;, an isolation room where a child was forced to sit in the corner of the room from 8am until midnight, then a mattress would be brought up and they would sleep in the corner until being woken at 7am. Most kids were sentenced to the Corner for weeks. Some got months. A handful were in the Corner for over a year, only leaving to get GM&#39;s.</p></li>
<li><p>Kids were forced to wear costumes and signs around their necks, for weeks. Elan got a little less bad as time went on, in the 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s adults/kids were forced to do things like wear dog-costumes and they would be chained to something outside and they would be left there for weeks.</p></li>
<li><p>In the 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s, adults/kids were forced to sleep in dumpsters. Kids had &quot;electric sauce&quot; poured over their heads as a form of punishment. This was a mixture of old food, piss, shit, and garbage.</p></li>
<li><p>All of our mail, phone calls, and interactions with the outside world were censored. Staff forced us to rewrite our letters multiple times before they were &quot;accepted&quot;. Incoming mail was also read by staff first and thrown away if the child had not &quot;earned it&quot; yet. </p></li>
<li><p>Kids did everything. EVERYTHING. So as part of &quot;the Program&quot;, it was a child&#39;s job to watch another child in isolation. I had piss, semen, and shit thrown at me by children who were in the Corner so long that they reverted to an animal-like mentality. And this was in the 2000&#39;s.</p></li>
<li><p>Having body fluids thrown at you was not so bad. Having chairs and blunt objects thrown at you was way scarier. And remember, the adults forced us children (the inmates) to watch the other inmates. So staff was rarely in harm&#39;s way. We were the ones in harm&#39;s way. We developed &quot;a call&quot; called &quot;Chief!&quot; for our own safety. If someone on the SP (support person) yelled it, then all of your buddies would run to your aid and we would all restrain or beat the shit out of the corner kid.</p></li>
<li><p>Elan took in kids from group homes, juvenile detention centers, high schools, and the children of the uber-wealthy. And put them all together. Elan regulary advertised in high-end magazines and pretended to be a boarding school. Even one of the Kennedy kids went there. </p></li>
<li><p>Elan charged the state or parents 40K a year to &quot;attend&quot; Elan. Nobody in Elan had a set departure date and your age didn&#39;t matter. Elan would keep children for 4 or 5 years sometimes. There was no escape and no rules beyond what Elan wanted.</p></li>
<li><p>Elan was staffed almost entirely by children/adults who had been sent to Elan and then hired as staff after &quot;graduating&quot;. They would offer these people houses, six-figure salaries, and other incentives to remain and become the torturers.</p></li>
<li><p>Parents were never in the position to know what was going on. And the conditions of Elan were so horrible that even after leaving, most parents refused to believe anything the children said or were too shocked to do anything about it.</p></li>
<li><p>Anyone who tried to expose Elan soon learned that the owners were in bed with high-profile politicians, local police, and the Maine media. Not to mention the fact that the creator (google Joe Ricci) was involved with the mafia.</p></li>
<li><p>Think I am making up the mafia-connection? The first Elan building burned to the ground, mysteriously, and the owner had insured it for far more than it was worth. Oh yeah, and this happened twice.</p></li>
<li><p>The owner of Elan, when confronted by the bank we was borrowing from for being involved in the mafia, sued the bank and won one of the largest settlements in Maine history. All the evidence against him and incriminating records also burned down in a mysterious fire. </p></li>
<li><p>Children were raped in the woods by staff members. Children were murdered after &quot;running away&quot;. One child died in the Ring. Another lost her baby.</p></li>
<li><p>The Elan complex was set up so that they could block any traffic from entering. When I was there, numerous news crews showed up to &quot;expose&quot; Elan but they instantly went into damage control mode and sent a few &quot;high-ranking&quot; children outside to play basketball and act like everything was normal. They took all of the screamers and children in isolation and moved them to more secluded parts of the complex. All windows were closed and the other children were threatened if they tried anything. This kind of &quot;lock-down&quot; happened multiple times.</p></li>
<li><p>There were 3 &quot;houses&quot;. The &quot;house&quot; I lived in was only sanctioned for 30 people but 60 were crammed into it. We lived in squalor and everything was rotten, dilapidated, and falling apart. We slept in military style bunks. </p></li>
<li><p>Though I cannot prove it, I am sure that Elan was deeply involved in a scheme similar to the &quot;Kids for Cash&quot; scandal in PA. Some kids were sent to Elan for as little as swearing in class or for skipping a day of school. Some judges sent kids to Elan for smoking pot or numerous other misdemeanor offenses. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>I could go on and on and on. I have barely scratched the surface here. The whole time I was there I was thinking &quot;how is any of this legal&quot;. Elan staff would say, &quot;you are not in America anymore, you are in Elan&quot;.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/44635665/Scribd#scribd">If you want to know how fucked up Elan REALLY was, I urge you to skim this pdf</a> that someone uploaded to Scribd.com.</p>

<p>The pdf is basically a trimmed down version of the book &quot;Duck in a Raincoat&quot; which was written by a person hired by Elan as a PR person but who basically was horrified and then decided to turn the tables on the place.</p>

<p>While writing the book, the author was threatened multiple times by anonymous people who started following her. She literally ended up selling her house and leaving the country to finish the book.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very interesting story. How did you end up there? It sounds like your parents sent you based on your story. Did you ever have a chance to talk to them on phone or face to face? Was there no way to tell them what was happening? Was there any indication of government involvement? Did people you saw there go on to high positions in the community?</p>

<p>And finally, is there a reason you are using a 9 month old account with no activity at all to post this?</p>
</div>

    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">41</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/murphys_inlaw.html">murphys_inlaw</a> 2015-05-13</p>
    <div class="md"><p>Legitimate question. I recently deleted my reddit account. Today I woke up and wanted to make a post to conspiracy but realized that if I made a new account, I would get caught in the new user filter and nobody would see it.</p>

<p>So I started digging around in my computer and I came up with an old screenshot of a post I made from this username. So I tried it and used my regular password, it worked. Ironically, I used this username to post some stories about Elan, so I immediately started thinking about it again while I scrolled through the comment and submission history of Murphys_inlaw.</p>

<p>So then I scrapped the post I was going to make and made this one about Elan instead. Of course, after deleting all of the previous comments and submissions. Because believe it or not, there are ex-Elan lunatics that still go through the web looking for any instance that Elan is brought up. And then they harass the people who post their stories because, like any cult, some of the people just will never get over it and they have to cling to the idea that it &quot;saved&quot; them and anyone who talks badly about it should be punished. </p>

<p>To answer your other questions.</p>

<p>My parents didn&#39;t send me. A judge sent me. I wasn&#39;t the best kid but wasn&#39;t the worst either. I probably deserved to be punished, but <em>normal</em> punished, not Elan punished.</p>

<p>All of my phone calls to my parents were monitored by another child in the program who would get in serious trouble if I spilled the beans. So they would basically hover their hand over the cut-off switch on the phone, especially while you were a new resident.</p>

<p>Elan literally couched me on how to speak to my parents when we were finally allowed to see each other for the first time. This was 6 months after being sent there. And I was never allowed to be alone with them, there always a SP (support person) with me who was pretending to be my friend but who was actually there to watch me and report everything that happened back to Elan. An entire system was in place and I saw the consequences of kids who tried to tell their parents anything that wasn&#39;t &quot;approved&quot;. It was really crazy shit. They had 30 years to perfect this before I arrived, so they were very good at it. There was a lot of manipulation and after 6 months, most kids were totally mind-fucked and scared to death to do anything that would be unacceptable in the eyes of &quot;the Program&quot;. </p>

<p>Also, since the place was run by kids, there was a &quot;peer pressure&quot; element that really made you question your own reality. Long story short, Elan started indoctrinating you from day one and they were very good at it. </p>

<p>Government involvement, definitely. Like I said, the owner was well connected politically, he even ran for governor of Maine twice. I am sure everyone was bought and paid for. After I got out and had enough time to get my marbles back, I contacted police and even local media and everything kept leading to dead ends. It was scary actually.</p>

<p>Most of the people I met in Elan went on the become drug addicts or criminals, even the ones who were nothing like that going in. A few turned out okay, maybe 35%. A few died shortly after leaving from overdoses, suicide, or being mixed up with the wrong people. </p>

<p>Its crazy because I really wanted to hang out with a lot of the people afterwards, since we had been through so much together. But I quickly learned that Elan created an environment that only made sense in Elan and that entering &quot;the real world&quot; (or as we called it in Elan &quot;out there&quot;) had a very crazy effect on many of them.</p>

<p>I keep in touch with a bunch of them, but I keep them at a distance. A handful I would trust to see in real life and I have kept up with them. </p>

<p>Its funny because a lot of the people who did &quot;well&quot; in &quot;the Program&quot; turned into complete fuck-ups and a lot of the people who rebelled against Elan turned out perfectly fine. Or in other words, behavior in Elan has no connection with how they turned out afterwards.</p>

<p>I could talk about this stuff for days. But at the moment, it kind of feels like picking at an old wound. Don&#39;t know why I decided to make this post today to be honest. </p>

<p>Thanks for asking.</p>

<p>Thanks for understanding and thanks for responding in your topic. Your story is a very hard one to read and I hope it at least brings you some comfort getting it off your chest and trying to expose these people.</p>

<p>If that&#39;s what you think then so be it. I actually asked him, I didn&#39;t assume anything the way you are.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know aboutyou but when I make a throwaway I do it at the time I need it and I tend to forget the password about a day later. Have you ever made a throwaway and not touched it for 9 months? If so, why? This is what I&#39;m asking. Read into it however you want.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Canyou call yourself a skeptic if you only are skeptical about things you disagree with and don&#39;t question things that fit your narrative? Are you really this upset with someone trying to get closer to the truth? Check out my post history and you&#39;ll see pretty quickly that I&#39;m not some &quot;rational skeptic&quot; here to disrupt. I want the truth.</p>

<p>EDIT: And finally, if you&#39;ve been here for more than a week or two you should know how much this sub gets brigaded and trolled. I think checking a person&#39;s account is a perfectly legitimate tool for helping find the truth.</p>

Roman Catholicism can and has been rather oppressive and aggressive in, not only teaching methods, but in regards to &#39;dissenters&#39;. While it has become more progressive in recent years, and Pope Francis being (somewhat) better than his predecessors, it largely depends on the Catholic you speak to, much like any other religion/denomination.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know about that.</p>

<p>The dig was trying to marginalizing r/conspiracy by claiming we would rather talk about &quot;The Greys&quot; (which isn&#39;t true) while claiming they have tried to posting this topic, which has only been brought up twice.  It was a half truth, yes we talk about Monsanto, but we don&#39;t really discuss aliens.  It was a weird comment from a user who made the account just for that comment, so I thought I would call them out.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It makes me think about all the stories that come out about hazing...You&#39;ll get these absolutely horrifying stories, and think to yourself, &quot;Obviously this isn&#39;t the first time that shit&#39;s happened...How is it that only now someone&#39;s talking about it?&quot;</p>

<p>Well...the people getting treated that way are only in that situation because they want to be accepted into that group, first off...And then, after it&#39;s been done to you, you do it to others...so of course you aren&#39;t going to talk about it.</p>

<p>I know high school football is just high school football...but I was in it, and if I told you that our program made the freshmen stay late to pack up all the equipment, had ceremonies where the older players smashed watermelons into their faces, only after paying homage to the &quot;Water Mellon God&quot;, and where I was literally punched in the face as a sophomore because the coaches wanted me to start varsity and that was my &quot;welcome&quot;...like in a good way...</p>

<p>From the outside you might say, &quot;Why the fuck would you put up with that?&quot;</p>

<p>Honestly, when it was my turn to smash watermelon in a freshman&#39;s face, I picked the kids who people weren&#39;t doing it to, because you could tell <em>they felt bad, and left out</em></p>

<p>After you went through that experience, you were a part of a club, just like all the older guys doing it to you had had it done to them. It may have been the only club that ever accepted you.</p>

<p>And when you were in the club, a lot of what happened in the club never left the club. Some of the gayest fucking shit I&#39;ve ever seen happened inside the football locker room. I&#39;ve seen the most most alpha, top dog, &quot;straight dudes&quot; lather each other up and <em>wrestle</em> on the shower floor...Had a guy stick his face in my crotch on the bus ride back after a game. We see each other out and about now, and we&#39;re both like, &quot;Hey man, how have you been?&quot;</p>

<p>And I really need to say, Elan=bad ... Little &quot;ceremonies&quot; where I try to make a shy freshman feel accepted by smashing watermelon in his face= not so bad...IMO...</p>

<p>Maybe there&#39;s a place for making it hard on the young ones, if it&#39;s done for the right reasons, in the right spirit, and in the right way...But just take that concept and blow it up by a factor of a thousand, and then do things to people that would land you in prison otherwise, and you have a recipe for creating some psychopathic motherfuckers that are ridiculously well connected, and equally well looked out for, and welcome to what we get to deal with today. :)  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>These horrible boarding schools were the stuff of nightmares id hear about back when I was sent to one of the &quot;wilderness therapy&quot; programs when I was in high school. They&#39;d keep you in these awful fucking programs for months and months and it cost parents more than a year&#39;s tuition to a private college for each &quot;session&quot;. My parents signed me up for 3 months and they only extended me twice. I knew people that had been kept for over 9 months. Apparently once you&#39;re at that point they convince the parents that you&#39;re &quot;beyond their help&quot; despite sucking up to 100k out of them.. And then recommend you attend one of their &quot;sister&quot; boarding school programs. The things I heard from my fellow inmates (we were NOT fucking campers and were all committed to the program involuntarily) about these supposed schools scared the living shit out of me bad enough that I was convinced that being a part of &quot;the system&quot; in their system was a worse fate than jail.. Because in jail they treat it as punishment, in programs like this they keep trying to sell torture as therapy and it&#39;s so surreal and scary. </p>

<p>I wish you the best recovering from this shit.</p>

<p>Much of what you mentioned was similar to what went on in my facility except for the condoned physical abuse.  This facility substituted constant emotional and psychological abuse for physical violence, for obvious reasons I suppose.</p>

<p>It really damaged nearly everyone who ended up there, at least one kid killed himself.  It recently closed down after losing a significant amount of business thanks to a truth campaign started by old victims.</p>

<p>It taught me a lot about the world and human nature, as well as indoctrination and brainwashing (for lack of a better term).  I have good reason for not trusting anyone.</p>

<p>It was called The Family Foundation School (they changed the name right at the end in an effort to avoid the negative publicity) and you can read all about it online at the truth campaign website.</p>

<p>I really pray these facilities become extinct one day. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t believe this is till going on! I grew up during the invention of the &#39;treatment center&#39; and narrowly escaped being put in one by my stepfather. Many of the same things you describe happened at &quot;Straight&quot; in Marietta GA. The worst though was called &quot;Anawakee&quot; (SP?) where the staff had sexually enslaved the &#39;patients&#39; who were forced to live in the woods until they had constructed their own living quarters (that tough love).</p>

<p>As long as I live I will never forget the sound of a young girl screaming &quot;No!!!&quot; in terror when the police showed up at our school to literally rip her from her desk and take her there.</p>

<p>She was twelve years old.</p>

People have testified, and while you might be embellishing a bit (or not) group yelling and fighting was apparently a legitimate part of their practice.</p>

<p>Only thing I would question is why you were sent there. It was &quot;for&quot; children with severe behavioral/social problems, and was meant as a form of rehabilitation. Obviously it didn&#39;t work fantastically, or maybe it did, with 60 kids a year, supposedly 15 movng out and 15 new ones in each year (although their site does say some children stayed less, some stayed longer) and 3 notable alumni in a positive sense. 40 year run, 15 kids per year, 1 in 200 kids that went through gained national recognition for positive reasons. Pretty good turnaround rate. Of course they produced two colossal fuck ups, but since the school is for colossal fuck ups, I  just don&#39;t know.  Just makes me wonder how you might have ended up there.</p>

<p>They would have an even better turnaround rate if they simply killed half the kids. Sure, 90 percent of the rest would rebel, but a few of them would  become insanely dedicated to whatever cause they joined. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not advocating it by the way, but my fiancee&#39;s mother was raised in Germany before the war. Child rearing there was brutal. And yes, it was good for producing people with great self discipline, who received national recognition. But that does not mean it was good for society.</p>

<p>Part 2 from another sketchy cache, formatting is wrong:</p>

<p>Here I am pulling again, watching a new kid in The Corner. “Pulling” is Elan-speak for “staying up all night” aka working the graveyard shift. There are a couple different kinds of pulling. I am pulling on the SP, which is short for Support Person. Every time a child is sent into isolation then another kid like me is assigned to his SP. Since The Corner is 24/7, someone needs to be assigned to stay up watching him at night to make sure he or she doesn’t try to escape or get into anything they aren’t supposed to be doing. I guess we can’t just lock him in the room because there are windows that they could escape from. Not to mention the suicide risk of leaving a Corner student alone. If the kid kills himself, how is Elan going to collect his “tuition”? The Corner is a chair is shoved where the two walls meet in a room isolated from the rest of the population. You are placed in the chair. You are inches from the wall, just enough to keep your knees in place and to make sure you don’t try to do anything that you aren’t allowed to do. You cannot talk, slump in your chair, move around, stretch your legs, or stand-up. You sit in the chair all day. At midnight your mattress is brought from the dorm and thrown onto the floor of your isolation room. You sleep on the mattress while an SP pulls on you in a desk-chair blocking the door. The next day you are woken up at 7am and brought down stairs to quickly shower and brush your teeth. Then from 7:15am until midnight you are facing the corner of the room again. If you try to do anything you aren’t allowed to do then your SP calls CHIEF and you are restrained and often times put into zipties. The worst thing about being ziptied is that is makes it much harder to eat your lunch or dinner when it arrives. Being in The Corner is hell, at least 1/3 of the people in The House have been there at least once. The usual time is a few days, but being in for a few weeks is not uncommon. Being put in for a few months happens as well. One or two people have been in for the better part of a year. When your Corner time ends, you are taken into the Dining Room to receive a General Meeting. After the GM you are returned to the population as a Shotdown. A lot of kids resist, react, or “act out” during the GM so they are taken right back up to The Corner after everyone “gets their feelings off”.</p>

<p>This process can go on for months and months. The thing about the Elan Program is that you won’t get kicked out. And there lies the real power of The Program. Everything that you can possibly do will be dealt with by the system. Once you get into Elan, don’t expect to be released. Another form of pulling is called “Night Owl”. That is a kid chosen to keep count of everyone in The House, all night long. Since we have both boys and girls here, there is one Night Owl for each gender. And since Elan is not stupid enough to allow a boy and girl to be alone together while everyone else is asleep, an adult is brought in to break up what The Program calls a “1-on-1”. This adult is called the Night Guard and is paid by Elan to come in every night. We have 3 or 4 Night Guards who all come in on different nights. The Night Guard calls a “run” every 10 to 15 minutes, from 1am until 8am. The boy Night Owl stays in the boys bathroom all night. When a run is called he pops out and goes in and out of all the dorms counting the boys while they sleep and then shouts his “count” to the Night Guard who records it. The boy Night Owl then switches with the girl Night Owl, who is guarding the back door Zone of The House all night. He guards the Zone while she goes through the female dorms and counts them. She shouts her count and then goes back to her Zone. Since the Night Guard sits on the Zone guarding the front door, him and the girl Night Owl have both exits covered all the time, all night. The boy goes back into the males bathroom until the next run is called. The “run” consists of walking into each dorm with a flashlight to count the sleeping bodies. You are required to lift the covers off of everyone to make sure they are not wearing shoes or clothes. This makes getting a decent night’s sleep in Elan very difficult and you eventually learn that if you wrap your feet in the blanket, you will be woken often. The Night Owl also shines the flashlight into the closets to check that no jackets or shoes are missing. Lastly, they walk over to the window and see that it is closed and they give the screen an examination to make sure it hasn’t been cut. It is also important to check the heaters in winter. They need to be clear because someone may try to cause a fire as a distraction to make a get-away. This process is then repeated in every dorm. When someone is in the Corner and another kid is on his SP all night, then the Night Owl also has to climb up the steps as part of his run and physically see us and add us to the count.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am that SP right now, and that is why I have the time to write my story into the margins of this book I am pretending to read. But every 10-15 minutes, I have to listen for his approaching steps so I can hide my pen and pick the book up to my face. If the Night Owl came up and caught me sleeping on my post then I would be in a lot of trouble. He would wake up another High-Strength to take my place and I would retire to my bed in the dorms. When I woke up I would be shotdown. Falling asleep even for a second while pulling SP on the Corner is a very serious breach of security. Shotdown is the lowest position in The House. The only person lower is the Corner student. If you are a shotdown (verb) and a brand new resident gets thrown into The House that day, then even he or she gets to eat before you do. As a Shotdown (noun), your job is to scrub a small section of the floor with a sponge all day. Shotdowns are chosen to do all the bad things in The House: scrub trashcans, showers, toilets. All day, every day. For days or weeks straight. So falling asleep is not an option for me. Even a long blink at the wrong time and I am screwed if the Night Owl catches it. In Elan, you are always being watched, even in the middle of the night while you are forced to watch someone else. During the day there is a system called Headcounts. Every ten minutes, from 9am to midnight, there is someone running through The House with a clipboard and a Headcounts sheet. The Headcounts sheet has the name of every single kid in The House. It looks like a piece of graph paper, with the names going down the side followed by a string of boxes. We have codes for every part of The House: SC for the Service Crew room, BO for the Business Office, X for the Security room, DR for Dining Room, etc… Headcounts goes through the entire House in about 6 minutes, records where everyone is, and then gets his run signed off by the Chief, COD, and Staff, in that order. Each may decide to double-check the run to make sure it is accurate. An inaccurate run could get you shot-down. Most New Residents have no idea that Headcounts is running all day.</p>

<p>As part of Headcounts, every so often the Coordinator-on-Duty calls HOUSE IN THE DINING ROOM and the Zones echo the call. Everyone, except Corner kids and their SP’s, are expected to immediately flood into the dining room and enter their chairs with military precision. During this time the Expeditors are also paying close attention to anyone who moves too slow or anyone not looking directly up front or slouching in their chair and this is all Guilt. Once everyone is in their place, which should take about 30 seconds by Elan Program standards, the Coordinator-on-Duty (or COD for short) reads each name and each person says YES after there name is called. This naming ritual happens 10 or more times a day, reminding everyone that running away is not a smart idea. Headcounts runs from 9am to Midnight. From Midnight – 1am, runs are made the Dorm Night Owls. 1am – 8am, runs are called by the Night Guard and carried out by the Pulling Night Owls. From 8am to 9am, runs are called by the COD and carried out by the Pulling Night Owls. In Elan, you are never NOT being counted. For as many years as you are doomed to stay here. Besides a 24/7 system of counting the children, 24/7 Zones that protect every exit and entrance, and an entire caste system of people with clipboards observing you all day; lets pretend that you do manage to get out of 1 of the 2 doors that lead outside. The only place to run is directly into the Maine wilderness. Deep wilderness that is covered in snow most of the year and guess what: you don’t have a jacket or boots. You were dressed for the Dining Room because that is the only place you are allowed to be dressed for. Every single morning a Strength with a clipboard records what every single kid is wearing. Wearing too many clothes is not allowed and if you do it you are called a “split-risk” and taken back in the dorms to change instead of eating breakfast. Wearing dark-on-dark is also not allowed unless you are a High Strength who has earned those privileges. You don’t even have enough hair on your head to keep warm because Elan only allows long hair to High Strength who have earned it! But it doesn’t matter if you split in Winter or split in Summer, there are another set of guards in the woods around Elan. I used to think it was a scare-story that the Staff told the Strength and the Strength blindly passed on to the non-Strength. Until I reached a position that allowed me to pull and I could watch these guards exit the woods in full camo, get into their cars and then drive home when their replacement showed up. Also, the Night Guard has a walkie-talkie and I can hear him constantly chatting with them. It must be just as lonely waiting around all night in The House as it is waiting around in the forest. Anyways, the point is that 24/7 forest-guards do exist. So even if you can miraculously make it out of The House, you now have a new threat to deal with. Anyone who tries to run away (or in Elan-Speak: split) from The House, is punished with The Corner and GM’s upon their capture. If you try to resist capture after making your escape them you will also be charged with breaking the “No Violence” Cardinal Rule and you will end up in The Ring. ..............</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been waiting to come across something like this for years. There&#39;s been lot&#39;s of movies made about subjects like this, and I&#39;ve always had the sinking feeling that the scripts for such movies came into existence from actual places, people, rumors and events. I&#39;m quite certain that these places still exist, especially for the children of the ruling elite. It&#39;s how you create sociopaths, and indoctrinate them into the <em>real</em> world of oligarchical control.</p>

<p>I believe it&#39;s why pedophilia is so common among the elite, ruling class, especially in the UK, where this type of shit has been going on for a long, long time. This type of abuse is the <strong>only way</strong> to create a global, generational conspiracy to dominate politics, finance and the economy, that&#39;s virtually impenetrable, and potentially thousands of years old. I&#39;d bet just about anything that Obama, and his wife, were initiates in programs like this, as well as numerous, if not most, presidents before him. This is what we&#39;re up against, and this is why the world is in such sad shape, why we&#39;re in a state of perpetual war.</p>

<p>If you ever wondered why corporate leaders, like Nestle CEO Tim Brown, <a href="http://www.scpr.org/programs/airtalk/2015/05/13/42830/nestl-waters-ceo-isnt-stopping-bottling-in-califor/">after being asked about removing water from California for bottled water sales</a>, can ay things like, &quot;Absolutely not. In fact, I&#39;d increase it if I could&quot;, now you know. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are various levels of programming, and every human participating in society on any level has undergone some. There is a specific level of programming, however, that is excessive and results in &quot;special slavery&quot; to the controlling powers. This is the programming described in the Greenbaum speech, where victims have their consciousness shattered into various pieces, and where each of these separate personalities are programmed at whim by their handlers. The result is a person with latent Dissociative Identity Disorder which can be called to the surface by the controlling powers through key words and events. This extreme type of mind control is rare and selective but the number of victims is now in the hundreds of thousands. &quot;Schools&quot; like OP described here were selection grounds for kids whose profiles seemed like a good pick for dissociative identities. They have a dark role to play for the elite when world events culminate.</p>

<p>There is nothing substantial to back up the claims made, and while the doctor who made the presentation is real, there is no related information about this from him to be found on the net.</p>

<p>I believe that it&#39;s possible for the write up to be true, but there&#39;s no proof to validate the claims. It&#39;s not smart to recommend, what amounts to a story, to someone as an introduction to something as serious as this topic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never read of any other reports about mind control subjects being persuaded to enter their subconscious, and disable the controlling robots by pressing their off switches. From what i recall, this is the main method found  in the greenbaum speech that&#39;s used to release people from their programming</p>

<p>the idea of controlling someone and instilling multiple personas independent of themselves is most likely true, I can believe that. But i tend to believe that ritual abuse and the worshipping evil part is more related to subterfuge and a preemptive way to discredit anyone who tries to bring this topic up. Not to mention that it&#39;s easier to blackmail someone once you have them doing really fucked up shit on camera</p>

<p>Satan killed 10 people. </p>

<p>There is an interesting text in the Nag Hammadi: Untitled: On the Origin of the World, I think there are 2 versions. In this bible, the characters are somewhat different, and it tells the story of Genesis from a different point of view. In this story, God is a blind, jealous god; he sees mans potential, and is afraid that man will become gods; out of fear, he forbids that they eat from the tree of knowledge. In this story, there is a Beast who is known as the Instructor or teacher. It&#39;s a very interesting read if you like to understand the alternative points of view; however, in some religions it is banned; reading it would put your very soul in peril, if you believe that sort of thing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for sharing your experience. </p>

<p>This is part of the extensive testimonial and factual evidence of abuses that violate human and civil rights undercover as legit institutions or operations (even if behavior modification doesn&#39;t sound bad enough). It&#39;s evident that regardless of the apparently imposed legality and constrictions these abuses were (and are) more the rule than the exception and I&#39;m sure (actually I am) this kind or worse abuses continue.</p>

<p>The only tragedy is that it took a long time to expose this. I hope people get aware of the absolute amorality and lack of ethics that rule some sections of the american government (and potentially a lot others), It&#39;s institutions and operations. </p>

<p>People need to be aware and demand more transparency and public regulations to this sort of activities, or at least the awareness might be key to avoid more victims.</p>

The Book you are quoting was edited and revised and edited and revised for centuries before it was translated into a language that you can read and &quot;understand&quot;.
