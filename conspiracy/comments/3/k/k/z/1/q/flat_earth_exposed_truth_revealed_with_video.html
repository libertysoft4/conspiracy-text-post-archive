<p>Brand new VR video was taken of space using 360fly on September 5th 2015 and was uploaded to their website 5 days later on the 10th.  I would love to hear what you think about this video.  Personally, I see zero evidence of a round Earth, but the majority of my research has led me to that.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can agree that it <em>looks</em> like it&#39;s flat... but I can&#39;t help but think the camera cannot capture the curvature because it is still so close the earth itself... being 12,000 KM wide... you would have to keep going out much further and to get multiple cameras at the same time around the earth doing the same thing... </p>

<p>The flat earth idea is so impossible to prove... with so many other conspiracies going on that can be proven and should have the world&#39;s attention... I just can&#39;t put much time and effort into this one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your reply is the most common used excuse to defend round earth.  The statement that the curve is so large and can&#39;t be seen,  is (in my opinion)  one showing how little research some rounders actually have done.   When I learned the slope (curve)  that the Earth must have,  I came to the realization that it does not exist.  3/4s of a foot time the distance in miles squared.  </p>

<p>Let&#39;s suggest you can see 100 miles from where the balloon is (I am sure it&#39;s much much more),  but even for 100 miles,  the curve is 750 feet.  Surely that would be visible to the eye.  I also believe in the ability of humans to perceive small changes in curves or straight lines. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t expect this video to convince most of you,  because you already have your minds made up.   It took me the months to find what I seem as ultimate proof.  Good luck on your journey. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How would the sun work on a flat earth? it seems to behave as it would with a spherical Earth. I imagine if the Earth was flat, the Sun would just revolve around a central point directly above the center of the Earth&#39;s surface. Except the sun gradually disappears behind the horizon, it doesn&#39;t shrink into a pinpoint as it would if it was just hanging there. And it doesn&#39;t disappear behind mountains because you can see it dip under the horizon over the ocean. Because, obviously, the Earth is spherical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With the sun&#39;s movement being complex, why would you think that the sun is in a simple circle... this wouldn&#39;t work.  You want to claim that the Earth is spherical, but you can&#39;t even understand how the sun would work in a flat model... this shows how little that you have researched or attempted to know the other possibilities.  If all I ever look at is one species of bird, and I never set out to look at other birds, I could conclude that is the only bird on Earth... that is what you are doing.  You are cutting down the possibilities by not even considering one side... that is called scien;tific bias.  It&#39;s okay that you have it, the majority of the world has it.  It&#39;s a double standard... just know that your opinion is very nonscientific because of that bias.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And your view of that being the only possible is because you haven&#39;t studied the flat earth models....  So your opinion of only possible is just sure to your bias.

    <div class="md"><p>I never said the video was about the sun. I brought up the sun because the way it moves can be observed by anyone and the way it moves is only possible with a spherical earth.</p>

<p>Basing your flat earth idea on video with an unknown amount of distortion, shot with a camera on a balloon of undetermined height is not, nor would it ever, be sufficient proof of a flat earth by virtue of the video having these previously stated attributes. </p>

<p>Your flat earth theory is completely undermined by the Sun&#39;s behavior. I have no need to &quot;divert attention&quot; and have made no attempt, funny or otherwise.</p>

<p>The video doesn&#39;t show anything profound. It shows nothing, which is what you have to back up your ridiculous assertion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually it is your type of comment that should be filtered out.</p>

<p>If you believe there are problems with what the OP is saying then address the issues specifically.  Shutting down debate by saying that a topic only exists to discredit has several problems.      </p>

<p>1) It makes for an easy technique to shut down discussion on a topic.<br/>
2) It does nothing to advance anyone&#39;s knowledge on the subject no matter what their current opinion is on it.<br/>
3) It turns discussions into shilling accusations which are very difficult to prove either way.  Instead we should discuss the evidence for the issue itself.</p>

<p>Charges of discreditation by association should be responded to by pointing out that there is no association.  Many people use this subreddit.  They have different beliefs and motivations.  There is no prerequisite to being able to post here so there is no association.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is no debate. Denying that the earth is spherical is like denying that grass is green or that 2+2=4. The evidence is everywhere and easily accessed by anyone, not by some government authority run by some nefarious shadow group. Discussing whether or not there is a flat earth leads to no advancement of knowledge in this day and age. Posts like the OP&#39;s only set to discredit the notion of open debate. People will point to likes of the OP&#39;s post and then use it to laugh at the notion of open debate, using it to shut down discussion of other conspiracies by comparing discussion on whether or not there is a flat earth. Also, I&#39;m not actually accusing anyone of shilling here. I just think the OP&#39;s post discredits the subreddit and waters down content. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The video is plain bullshit and proves nothing. The video stills in an of themselves may look flat, but combining them to get a panoramic view would should the earth&#39;s curvature more clearly. Also, it&#39;s not as though the equipment they were using was very experience. Anyone earning an average wage could gather together the equipment needed and launch a similar balloon to reproduce the results. Maybe you should try it yourself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks William.</p>

<p>Unfortunately very few people will actually watch the videos before commenting.  For the majority of people the shape of the earth is axiomatic, along the lines of 1+1=2, it is beyond questioning.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve spent a good amount of time on this subject myself.  From what I have seen the official spinning globe model does not work for a number of reasons.  However disproving the globe does not directly prove any other specific model.  </p>

<p>There are a few problems with the standard flat earth model.  One of the big ones: how do long summer days work in the Southern &#39;hemisphere&#39;?  If we assume that the sun has the same viewable distance at all times and locations, in order to get a 17 hour day at the tip of South America in the height of Southern summer, this viewable distance would need to be much too large to make day lengths work at other locations.  For the standard flat earth model to work I would need to see a plausible explanation for variable viewable sun distance.  Of course, disproving the standard flat earth model is not a direct proof of the official globe model either.</p>

<p>On another topic: In one of your other recent videos you discussed non-human sourced cosmic transmissions that were analyzed to be error correcting codes.  It sounded like you didn&#39;t really know what this means.  Error correcting codes refer to data transmission with extra information sent along to correct for interference in the transmission.  This allows a certain number of bits in the transmission to be in error, but for the information to still be decoded accurately into the original message.  Not really anything to do with division by 0 (I think that was the example you used).</p>
