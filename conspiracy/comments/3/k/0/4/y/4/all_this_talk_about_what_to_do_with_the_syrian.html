    <div class="md"><p>Amazing how many people even here don&#39;t understand it.</p>

<p>This has been planned for a very long time.   </p>

<p><a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/we-re-going-to-take-out-7-countries-in-5-years-iraq-syria-lebanon-libya-somalia-sudan-iran/5166">http://www.globalresearch.ca/we-re-going-to-take-out-7-countries-in-5-years-iraq-syria-lebanon-libya-somalia-sudan-iran/5166</a></p>

<p>9/11 was the excuse to take out 7 countries in 5 years.   Iraq and Libya, done.  Iran keeps getting cock-blocked by Russia, and now Obama (or somebody) has managed to give up on that and do this &quot;peace deal&quot; (which is really a mafia-style protection racket scheme -- &quot;We don&#39;t bomb you if you sign these papers), which is really a scheme to pry Iran away from being allied with Russia.   </p>

<p>Syria has always been on the map, like forever, because they were backed by the USSR back in the day, and current-day Russia still has a naval base there and is still allied with them.</p>

<p>The insane power-crazed world-dominating-fantasizing nutjobs who run the US REALLY REALLY have a hard-on for going to war with Russia.  They think they can turn Russia into a failed state, like they&#39;ve done with Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia, Libya, and (they hope very soon) Syria.  </p>

<p>They&#39;ve been trying their damndest to lure Russia into a war over the Ukraine.  Russia has been extremely smart about not taking their bait.   </p>

<p>Also, it was Russia who cock-blocked them the last time they thought they had carte-blanche to start bombing Syria (anybody remember?  Attention spans are so short these days), when they had a great little &quot;poison gas&quot; false flag they could pin on Assad.   Russia pulled the rug out from under them that time and they might this time, too.</p>

<p>The entire creation of ISIS was done by the US and Nato.  ISIS is a proxy force.   Do you really think we wouldn&#39;t be able to destroy flotillas of Toyota pickup trucks travelling in endless convoys through the open desert in broad daylight if we actually wanted to??</p>

<p>Also, those &quot;Muslims&quot; in ISIS don&#39;t even know which direction Mecca is.  There are photos of them supposedly doing their prayers and they&#39;re pointed all different directions.  It&#39;s laughable.   People in the Middle East know damn well ISIS is bogus, they&#39;re a mercenary force backed by the US/Israel/Turkey.   </p>

<p>So here we have Syria, which has been in the crosshairs for years and years, suffering under what they&#39;re calling a &quot;civil war&quot; which is actually a paid-for mercenary force (backed by people with endlessly deep pockets) who are, yes, monsters, and now Turkey is also using this as an excuse to exterminate the Kurds, whom they&#39;ve always wanted to destroy), and it&#39;s a giant disastrous mess.</p>

<p>Now the people who run the show are exploiting the refugee disaster, which THEY CREATED in the first place, to gin up support for bombing Syria itself rather than pretending to bomb Isis (which they don&#39;t actually do, or so in such small quantities -- just for show --  that it&#39;s meaningless).   The idea from the very first has been to have an excuse to literally bomb Assad and his military to smithereens.  </p>

<p>This is their second major try after the &quot;poison gas&quot; false flag.</p>

<p>Coming to a theater near you very very soon.   Labor day is always a good time to introduce new products.</p>

<p>And if anyone thinks that it&#39;s the picture of this drowned kid that made all the difference, we had a similiar picture of a child in Gaza who had been playing on the beach who was shelled by Israeli ships and his broken and dead body was splayed in the sand in a similar way, only not in the &quot;sleeping beauty&quot; fashion of the drowned toddler.  The Palestinian kid&#39;s death was far more gruesome.   But -- why wasn&#39;t that spread around?  Why did that not go viral?  </p>

<p>Because it wasn&#39;t in the plan.  Wasn&#39;t in the script.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The above narrative may be very popular on conspiracy forums, and it does contain hints of truth, but it&#39;s generally wrong </p>

<p>The neo-cons in power, Bush, Rove, etc wanted to take out Saddam for a number of reasons, and you are right, 911 was used as a handy excuse, they rushed into a botched pre-emptive war against world opinion, against international consensus, against the UN.. and we&#39;re still living with the repercussions of it today</p>

<p>One of the worst foreign policy blunders in recent memory</p>

<p>The crisis in Syria was more directly to do with the Arab spring - some of the factors of which can be traced back to the Iraq war and the Cold War - but the main factor was people were getting sick of the unemployment, corruption, and having the same leaders for decades - coupled with social media, and sparks in Tunisia - most countries underwent large protests - including Saudi, Bahrain, etc (lest we handily forget)</p>

<p>Libya was an international effort by... everyone. Even the Chinese or Russians didn&#39;t veto it. The Arab league were the group that pushed hardest. Was it a good idea? we don&#39;t know, because Libya is now quite split and lawless, however it&#39;s still in far better condition than Syria where there was no largescale direct foreign intervention (the current coalition airstrikes are much more limited)</p>

<p>There wasn&#39;t some grande &quot;script&quot; or &quot;plan&quot; for the last decade of history in the Middle East, it&#39;s just a whole shitload of factors.</p>

<p>Some people just cherry pick these to build up a &quot;story&quot; that happens to coincide with their own personal worldview rather than what actually happened - those are the kind of blogs we get on globalresearch.ca and so on</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Syria was targeted for regime change long before the Arab spring. During the Iraq debacle, foreign fighters were allowed transit through Syria to Iraq by Assad. This corridor enabled jihadis to engage and kill U.S. soldiers--just as in the Vietnam war, Laos and Cambodia were targeted for the very same reason.</p>

<p>Such a tired narrative you peddle. Under the pretext of humanitarian reasons the U.S. Intervened?  Using history as an example, the preponderance of evidence suggests the U.S. Only acts in pure self interest--not for fancy ideals like human rights. Moreover,evidence suggests the U.S. Either stoaked the flames of the Arab spring at worst, or co opted the movement at best. </p>

<p>True, but that idea was toyed with during the Bush administration by the architects of the Iraq invasion. However with the subsequent disaster in Iraq, any hopes of that were firmly quashed</p>

<p>Relations between Assad and the West (e.g. France and the US) were actually improving (relatively speaking) before the uprising</p>

<p>The US, like any other country, acts within it&#39;s own interests. Those interests can the more grim Real Politik of strategic decisions, secured resources, power-play, etc and can also be humanitarian interests, setting an example, acting on principles, maintaining reputation, status</p>

<p>Most historians and intelligent observers can make an objective distinction, and within context</p>

<p>The ultra-cynics don&#39;t. They only selectively process that information which shares their prejudice/world view rather than the independent truth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Undoubtedly, context is of the utmost importance when understanding events and history. Viewing US foreign policy since the 1980&#39;s in its proper historical context, one may start to decern a pattern--the true costs of US  global hegemony are borne by those unfortunate individuals living in countries who refuse to play ball with the US.-- The myriad conglomeration of corporate, military,political and religious interests have set the US on a collision course 
With countries large and small. The united fruit company and its coups in Guatemala come to mind.</p>

<p>Most historians and intelligent observers see patterns within its historical context and can make objective distinctions.</p>

<p>The Washington apologists always perform great feats of mental gymnastics whilst justifying the immoral and illegal.  </p>

<p>Such hypocrisy! The US and assad were almost friends before the Arab spring? The &#39;bloodthirsty&#39; despot, as he is depicted in Us media now, was a friend of the US? How many other right wing desposts were allowed to reign  as long as the needs of uncle sam were met?  The list will be too long to mention here I think.</p>

<p>Alternatively, being personally incredulous has no bearing on the matter. Emotion can come in and distort understanding.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not black and white. As family dynasty&#39;s in the ME go, Assad&#39;s was not actually the worst, he was relatively popular despite the horrendous human rights records of the country, the brutality of his father, the lack of freedoms, and the toll that was taking on Syrian society</p>

<p>As much as other nations may have disagreed with Assad&#39;s leadership, they still had to continue dealing with that country. Likewise there&#39;s nothing overtly hypocritical about South Korea continuing relations with North Korea.. it&#39;s hugely complicated, and the carrot and stick is both used in equal measure, each having it&#39;s own benefits and drawbacks</p>

<p>But there are those with the worldview that everything that happened in Syria is ultimately the fault of a country that supported Assad and played geopolitics with the region previously. </p>

<p>Links can be made, history can be selectively dredged and blame can be assigned to Russia (see what I did there), but Putin and previous administrations cannot be scapegoated as the main cause for the ongoing conflict in Syria</p>

<p>That&#39;s not going to stop cynics of any major power from purposefully seeking to implicate and malign their chosen target</p>

<p>Whether it&#39;s Saudi, the US, Turkey, Russia, etc.. they&#39;ve all played their part, good and bad, in affecting the current conflict.. </p>

<p>However the main causes of the conflict remain domestic, the simmering cauldron of pressure building over the years, the sectarian divides of the country, the leadership which is ultimately responsible and lack of any successful reforms</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some Blame can be parceled out amongst the regional and global players respectively. However, its the trappings of empire that have embroiled the US in this quagmire--the majority of blame can rest soley at the feet of uncle sam when viewed in this context.</p>

<p>Consider the illegal 2003 invasion of Iraq.  As most informed commentators at the time prognosticated, the situation  would quickly devolve along sectarian lines further inflaming an already precarious balance! Compound that invasion with the invasions in Afghanistan and its attendent perils ( Pakistan and the ISI) and sanctions against Iran, one can see the inherent folly of attempting to remodel the entire region through the barrel of a gun.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s look at the neoconservative doctrines espoused by individuals like Robert Kagan, Douglas Feith et al. Their beliefs of American exceptionalism and the efficacy of the US military, insofar as an inherent good and noble institution ,capable of making the world safe for democracy by invading and brutalizing weaker countries has been relegated to the dustbin of history. The aforementioned is evidenced by one foreign policy failure after another --the mayhem and destruction wrought upon the  world by US adventurism has made the world less safe--violence begets more violence lets not forget.</p>

<p>Neo conservatives constituted a majority of Bush white house staffers and ministers. Their overtly niave world view coupled with the means to implement it is a major reason why the world of 2015 is the way it is. </p>

<p>Real politik is the epitome of cynicism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t really see Russia giving up that naval base though, they&#39;ve already started to deploy troops - if anything, we might gleam if Putin really is standing against a international cabal, by intervening on Assad&#39;s behalf at a more escalated level - or if he just lets Assad wash away with the tide.</p>

<p>You are right though, there&#39;s been some pretty sweet mental gymnastics in asylum threads that invokes compassion for human suffering, but never call into question the latent failures and events that lead to the current situation or the <em>people</em> who have, and are currently bombing these areas.</p>

<p>Cause and effect is completely divorced as you still see people cheering on the bombing of sovereign peoples and nations, and military intervention.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a spiral, all the way down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its not just Syrian refugees. Somalian, Libyan, Sudianies and Yemenis citizen (to name a few) have been forced to flee war in their countries now for a number of years. Not to beat around the bush; this exodus of people from their homes is a direct result of US-lead Western interventionism, but i am sure this is not news to anyone hear.</p>

<p>Its sad really, because unfortunately, the majority of people are truly disillusioned. The narratives spewed by our media and entertainment industries tell a story of how, indigenous feuds and fundamentalist religious crusades (read Islamic State) are the primary reasons for this refugee crisis, that has magical now become an issue.   </p>

<p>While i know that Global research  is linked a lot on this subreddit, i truly believe some of there contributers <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-refugee-crisis-and-the-genocidal-nature-of-us-nato-interventions/5474296">have important this to say!</a> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Assad wouldn&#39;t play ball with the central bankers and as a result the US decided to overthrow Syria to destabilize the countries in the ME. See General Wesley Clarke admission. The CIA directed al-Qaeda in IRAQ, then changed their name to ISIS to confuse the public. The US uses ISIS as their own private army to rebuff the Iranian influence. </p>

<p>The US wants Assad gone because he aligns with Iran, Russia and China. Think of today&#39;s ME as just a place for the 3 big boys to have military bases for the staging of the next phase of this proxy war. US has IRAQ, SA, QATAR, TURKEY, JORDAN, and ISRAEL but Russia and China have IRAN and the &quot;STANS.&quot; Both sides are just trying to setup bases in the ME to counter each others threat.  This is a full blown proxy war between BRIC countries and western banksters. The US started this nice little war in Syria but arming the &quot;rebels&quot; aka ISIS with huge caches of weapons through the Libyan Embassy in Benghazi? Remember Ambassador Stevens? He was taken out by ISIS and the CIA stood down because he knew too much about the gun running to terrorists in Syria. Sickening isn&#39;t it? </p>

<p>The global war has begin. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What happened in the first place?</p>

<p>A power vacuum was created when the power was removed from Iraq. It caused local people to fill in the gap and people were attracted regionally who could most exploit the situation and they did.</p>

<p>The refugee crisis is as much an effect of ISIS as it is of the world&#39;s acceptance of ISIS.</p>

<p>Had they been the God&#39;s friendly bunch of Syria rebuilders, the people would still be there, and the world would be helping.</p>

<p>We do know what happened</p>

<p>Countries like the US, France, UK funded and trained portions of the moderate secular rebels, and that was quite late in the conflict, and actually quite limited (FSA members would defect to the precursors of ISIS because they were far better armed)</p>

<p>Wealthy financiers from Saudi, Qatar, etc funded huge numbers of men, either veterans of the insurgency in Iraq, raw recruits, fundamentalists to go and fight against the Shia (Allawite) Assad. Many of these groups later merged to form what we now know as ISIS</p>

<p>Cause and effect is completely divorced as you still see people cheering on the bombing of sovereign peoples and nations, and military intervention.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a spiral, all the way down.</p>

<p>You might want to do some more research on their tactics (hint: Guerrilla warfare) and said tactic&#39;s typical level of effectiveness against conventional forces (hint: incredibly). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The above narrative may be very popular on conspiracy forums, and it does contain hints of truth, but it&#39;s generally wrong </p>

<p>The neo-cons in power, Bush, Rove, etc wanted to take out Saddam for a number of reasons, and you are right, 911 was used as a handy excuse, they rushed into a botched pre-emptive war against world opinion, against international consensus, against the UN.. and we&#39;re still living with the repercussions of it today</p>

<p>One of the worst foreign policy blunders in recent memory</p>

<p>The crisis in Syria was more directly to do with the Arab spring - some of the factors of which can be traced back to the Iraq war and the Cold War - but the main factor was people were getting sick of the unemployment, corruption, and having the same leaders for decades - coupled with social media, and sparks in Tunisia - most countries underwent large protests - including Saudi, Bahrain, etc (lest we handily forget)</p>

<p>Libya was an international effort by... everyone. Even the Chinese or Russians didn&#39;t veto it. The Arab league were the group that pushed hardest. Was it a good idea? we don&#39;t know, because Libya is now quite split and lawless, however it&#39;s still in far better condition than Syria where there was no largescale direct foreign intervention (the current coalition airstrikes are much more limited)</p>

<p>There wasn&#39;t some grande &quot;script&quot; or &quot;plan&quot; for the last decade of history in the Middle East, it&#39;s just a whole shitload of factors.</p>

<p>Some people just cherry pick these to build up a &quot;story&quot; that happens to coincide with their own personal worldview rather than what actually happened - those are the kind of blogs we get on globalresearch.ca and so on</p>
