<p>Full quote from William Bramley’s book <a href="http://cdn.preterhuman.net/texts/alien.ufo/Bramley,%20William%20-%20The%20Gods%20of%20Eden.pdf">“The Gods Of Eden”.  Page 341</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps the most important fact about modern communism to explain Western banking support is the fact that communism is actually capitalism taken to an extreme. To understand this, we must take a look at what &quot;capitalism&quot; really is. </p>

<p>”Capitalism&quot; and &quot;free enterprise&quot; are often equated. They should not be. &quot;Free enterprise&quot; is unfettered economic activity; it occurs where there is a free and open market for the production and barter of goods and services. Entrepreneurs (people who start businesses and take the risks) are the backbone of &quot;free enterprise&quot; systems. </p>

<p>”Capitalism,&quot; on the other hand, has two basic definitions. The first definition elates to so-called &quot;capital goods.&quot; Those are goods that are used to manufacture other products. A typical capital good would be a machine used on an assembly line. A &quot;capitalist&quot; can therefore mean a person who buys capital goods and uses them to manufacture other products for a profit. This type of capitalist is usually found in a &quot;free enterprise&quot; system, but he or she does not require a free enterprise system to survive. He or she can exist in almost any type of political or economic system so long as a profit is made. In fact, this type of capitalist often survives best in a closed enterprise system where there is little or no competition. </p>

<p>Governments are capitalists when they own and invest in capital equipment. </p>

<p>The second type of capitalist is the &quot;financial capitalist.&quot; Financial capitalism is the control of resources through the investment and movement of money. It may or may not involve the purchase of capital goods. A financial capitalist usually invests his money in company stocks and influences the use of resources by determining what enterprises he will invest in. A financial capitalist may also be a banker who is entitled to create inflatable paper money to lend, and who is able to influence the use of resources by how he lends out his &quot;created out of nothing&quot; money. The financial capitalist also does not require a free enterprise system to survive and often benefits from monopolies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have my vote.  Definitely.  I vote we rebel as well.</p>

<p>However, we must make sure that we move forward with the <em>right</em> kind of rebellion - a rebellion that is as absolutely <em>intelligent</em> as possible; one that doesn&#39;t have as its focus guns and bombs and knives and violence (though we shouldn&#39;t be afraid to use those if absolutely necessary to protect ourselves).  Instead, it should be a rebellion that focuses on discipline, unity, togetherness, intelligence, and a communal cooperation that works together in so concerted a manner that it makes our need for a government &quot;Big Brother&quot; above us absolutely moot and obsolete.</p>

<p>This involves a fundamental paradigm shift amongst <em>all</em> of us - one that causes each of us to put down the false racism and prejudiced indoctrination that&#39;s been built up in all of us from birth.  We have been kept apart, divided, and separated on purpose, and for a reason:  We are much more easily ruled over when we&#39;re kept apart, separated, divided, and antagonistic toward each other.  This is the very reason why we must come together <em>first</em>.</p>

<p>If we do that, a rebellion will likely never be needed, for we will already have won.</p>

<p>Matter of fact...THAT is what our <em>real</em> rebellion needs to be actually.  The real rebellion that will REALLY bring TPTB down is the one that unifies all of us as the one people and species which we are and have forgotten/have been made to forget.  Nothing short of this will allow us to do away with the manipulation over all of our lives.</p>

<p>And no.  I&#39;m not talking about some New World Order.  I&#39;m not talking about some horrible PTB-imposed false flag that scares the shit out of everyone and <em>that</em> causes people in society to put down their problems (for a temporary moment) and work together.  No.  Fuck that.  Hell, that&#39;s what 911 was.  So many Americans came together only so they could then go to wage more wars of aggression abroad and kill thousands more people.  smh</p>

<p>No.  I&#39;m talking about REAL togetherness that doesn&#39;t need any artificial prompting by an external, clandestine power manipulating society.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t disagree with this.  I see no reason why we couldn’t both work toward the unity that I spoke about above here <em>and</em> remain militarily diligent within ourselves and against any possible attacking force.</p>

<p>On this particular planet, that does seem to be the case.</p>

<p>Some may not be human at all, actually.  However, those humans that <em>are</em> sociopaths do seem to be more flawed than not.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I wouldn’t disagree with this, and I don’t think this necessarily invalidates a society’s ability to still come together as one people and species.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And after watching this... (I&#39;m still gobbling up Larken&#39;s perspective) You should watch this if you have the time and interest it is about the importance of understanding our right of ownership of ourselves and the right to defend ourselves against any aggressor. Here is the video:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYOKVTaflbM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYOKVTaflbM</a></p>

<p>But to summarize the most important aspect of his talk, if we don&#39;t stand up for our right to defend ourselves, and we continue to treat authority as an unstoppable force that has more power than any other human being, then we have achieved nothing in our pursuit of freedom. If there is 1 guy in a room with a 100 pacifists and that 1 guy has a gun and threatens everyone in the room, the guy with the gun wins. </p>

<p>The ideal revolution would just be one where we flood the internet and every source of media that we can with the idea that, we are all sovereign, we are all free, we will not be taxed, we are not subject to any governments laws because government is a fiction and from now on people have the right to defend themselves against violence in any form whether it comes from a badge or not. Basically just a warning so people on the other side of the fence will understand that the illusion bubble has just popped. There will be no aggression, there will be no violence, because that is the point, NO ONE has that right, but EVERYONE has the right to defend themselves. Either that ends peacefully or the oligarchy gets it&#39;s war machine into gear and then we have no choice but to defend our god given rights.</p>

<p>I&#39;d be interested in hearing your opinion on these matters. They seem to be at the crux of the issue.</p>

<p>Ha.  Exactly.  The way he just so casually and matter of factly responds to the questioners marginalizing question was at once completely casual and un-offended, yet entirely poignant and <em>very</em> difficult (if possible at all) to argue against.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yep…such is the dilemma which is humanity to a large, large extent, it seems.  This is the problem we have with almost every area of life here in this civilization.  We are, essentially, ants whose hill gets trampled one minute, resulting in immediate mass chaos across the entire colony, only to go right back after not more than an hour or so to doing exactly the same thing they were doing before the calamity hit as if nothing ever happened at all.</p>

<p>While I have come across comments that he has made stating that 911 “was <em>not</em> any sort of false flag attack” - letting me know that Chomsky on a deep, deep level is likely  controlled opposition - the fact of the matter is that he is a renowned political scholar, and a decent amount of what he has to say is very relevant where it regards an understanding of the political climate of the day and age.</p>

<p>See I didn&#39;t know that... I mean how can anyone honestly say they know that for sure?? Sounds like even he is afraid to tackle that issue. In one of the previous interviews I&#39;ve seen (if I recall correctly) he built a fairly strong argument for why most if not all presidents since vietnam should be treated as war criminals... so for me it seemed an easy assumption that he would be able to see through 9/11 as a false flag event.</p>

<p>Yep.  He’s also Jewish, which means that even though he is very understanding of and speaks against the crime against humanity which most definitely is Zionism, and he is very aware of the Israeli apartheid against Palestine, he still has a loyalty to (if not a fear of) that very Zionist regime he is often enough critical of.</p>

<p>Oh man I <em>looove</em> that retelling of his.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdD9uSrNFT4">It’s awesome.</a>.  This is why Chomsky <em>is</em> a badass when it comes to a lot of information against TPTB.  However, he is a limited hangout because he only “sticks in the tip”, so to speak, and does not go <em>balls deep</em> into what he REALLY knows about the bullshit that is going on.  He knows he’d end up in a pine box if he did, and I understand that fear, but people need to understand even more so that Chomsky is NOT telling everything he knows about what’s going on in this world sociopolitically, so he should not be regarded as the “world leader in all sociopolitical things!” as so many often think.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yep - which makes his constant and abject denial of its being the false flag attack that it was all the more blatant and criminal on his part.</p>

<p>I ultimately feel very ambivalent about Chomsky because of this.</p>

<p>In Fascism,  the government rigs the rules on a daily basis.   What is called the market place is therefore part of what is minutely controlled by myriad controls.</p>

<p>Now,  I am all for rules by which the market place should be regulated to protect the environment and the population,  to reduce corruption.     But that is not how the rules work when the most powerful players are calling the shots and owning the politicians.</p>

<p>The closest thing we have to democracy is the kind of polling that could let the politicians know when the serfs on the plantation are about to revolt.    Polls are used to help guide policies.    Which includes keeping the serfs focused on so called divisions between themselves.</p>

<p>Exactly.</p>

<p>Cannot agree more with everything you said here.  This entire sentiment is how I feel as well.  Nothing wrong with rules, but <em>everyone</em> must follow them.</p>

<p>The closest thing we have to democracy is the kind of polling that could let the politicians know when the serfs on the plantation are about to revolt.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, A) I don’t think they have a great deal to worry about right now, and B) I think TPTB have a lot of methods to deal with a possible pleb revolt.  Look at what happened with Occupy Wall Street and how that was quickly and greatly infiltrated, co-opted, marginalized, and it just kind of puttered out after a short while.</p>

<p>Polls are used to help guide policies. Which includes keeping the serfs focused on so called divisions between themselves.</p>

<p>So true, and so fucked up… :/</p>

<p>The more we unite as a people, citizenry, and as a <em>species</em>, the less power TPTB will have over us.  Most of us simply don’t seem to get it and are just too busy finding ways to keep hating and fighting one another to realize that this is the exact way TPTB want us to be so that we don’t realize it’s <em>they</em> that are inordinately responsible for the problems, issues, and conflicts going on.  We realize <em>that</em>, and we might end up (rightfully) turning our efforts on them.</p>

If they have not earned the right to continue,  then the charters,  as for corporations,   should not be renewed,   forcing a liquidation of the enterprise.

</blockquote>

<p>Well it depends on what kind of “rewards” you’re referring to.  If you mean “material and power” rewards, then perhaps.  Rewards in the emotional and spiritual spectrum can exist and take place entirely independent of empire, however.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Near the center of empire, the most ambitious and psychopathic gather to duke it out for the potential rewards, and bystanders are totally dispensable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sounds like a pretty dismal, despicable place - one where I don’t think really too many real rewards exists, and a place I personally wouldn’t want any part of.</p>

<p>They can most definitely keep those kinds of “rewards”.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, for trends that reveal what will replace the existing model of the nation-state, it would be wise to look at the fringes of empire, not at the center.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seems about right, as the center is the old guard that will likely get replaced by whatever the new guard (on the fringes) is/might be.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At the fringes, the new technologies of communication will allow for alternative arrangements between people that bypass the control of the nation-state. And the propaganda of the nation-state is more ignored. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s certainly what has been happening since the internet came out and the MSM became less and less potent, with alternative media and web content becoming where some types get most if not all of their information.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The nation-state is going to invest their money elsewhere. So, a different kind of community can and will emerge. By the time the empire realizes it, the model will have gone viral.

How long will the state last when the productive elements of society realize that they can only lose in a state controlled environment?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This seems like a decent summation of what can happen/is somewhat happening already.  Thing is, however, that TPTB will indeed make one last, strong push to retain power as it sees its influence irrevocably slip away.  The beast is most dangerous when it is wounded and making its last effort to keep from entirely falling away.  For this reason, even though it does indeed seem that there is an alternative element beginning to take the fore, we must still be very disciplined and focused - and make sure that A) the beast doesn’t get one last swipe or claw in and take us down as it’s falling, and B) we must make sure that the new system that comes up is actually BETTER than the old one.  Don’t want to go from one problem into another or an even worse one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There will still be many forms of government, which is &quot;social orders&quot; that serve the common interests.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We just need social orders that serve the common interest <em>much</em> more representatively, for such is not the case right now at all really.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Look for human links that start off with a voluntary basis, that are very responsive the the populations they represent. See if they can continue on a voluntary basis, <strong>or if they turn to coercion and manipulation to affect their agendas.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Such seems to be what <em>all</em> societies and systems have to be diligently careful and on guard for.  Things might <em>start off</em> nice, but once the honeymoon’s over, you have to make sure things don’t turn sour.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think that coercion and manipulation are orchestrated in secrecy. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Depending on what kind of coercion and manipulation you’re referring to, this can be very correct.  Some types of coercion and manipulation are VERY overt and in your face - done in front of the population for purposes of inducing fear and subservience.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The existing nation-state models must be terrified of the open source movement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And this is the very reason why they DO sometimes resort to open and overt violence and manipulation.  This government has been doing this very thing more and more in the past years since 911.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Open source seems to hold promise in maintaining voluntary cooperation. Full disclosure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  There is a great struggle going on, however, between the “open source” forces, and the covert PTB.</p>

<p>Ultimately, good points made, sir.  Good points.</p>

<p>Well,  you might not like riding in private jets or staying at luxury resorts.     But I can assure you,   some people do.</p>

<p>In other words &quot;I would sell my soul&quot;  to (fill in the blank)  win the lottery,  be a billionaire,   etc.</p>

<p>So a lot of people still do aspire to that and are willing to risk failing even if the price of failure is steep.    Yet the reality is that you can&#39;t win,  and even if you did,   it would be a loss.    50 years ago,  winning still felt like winning.    Now,  its starting to look more like a loss from day one,  even if you are riding the jet and staying in one of the exclusive gated resorts.   Its just a prison with golden chains anymore.</p>

<p>Anyway,  thanks for the post.   I always like seeing your stuff.    You used to make great arguments about jet air speeds,   didn&#39;t you?</p>

<p>Yeah.  I totally understand that some (many, perhaps) have this type of mentality, but those who think like this for the most part don’t have an understanding of how fleeting, temporary, and ephemeral this life is, and how insignificant are the material things we strive for and make so many efforts to accrue while here.</p>

<p>Yes.  Exactly this.</p>

<p>And that, I would say, is because what most of us are striving to “win” in this life are actually <em>the wrong things</em>.</p>

<p>From the admittedly little I know about either, they don&#39;t seem like impossibilities per se.  Nonetheless, however, the versions of these forms of government that have been practiced on this planet have met with generally dismal results for the overall population and have been, as a result, generally unsuccessful - at least as far as I&#39;ve been able to assess.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Sounds about right in that the human variable does seem to make almost any theory much more complicated (and sometimes untenable) in actual practice.</p>

<p>One can lead to cronyism, the other can lead to dictatorship.</p>

<p>...which can sometimes be two sides of the very same coin.  I think this was a great part of the point Bramley was making.</p>

<p>No state that has attempted communism has achieved the structure Marx &amp; Engels outlines, just as the U.S. was never a free market unfettered by command economy regulations. </p>

<p>This is the section (of the manifesto) I&#39;m talking about:</p>

<ul>
<li>1. Abolition of property in land and application of all rents of land to public purposes. </li>
<li>2. A heavy progressive or graduated income tax. </li>
<li>3. Abolition of all rights of inheritance. </li>

<li>6. Centralisation of the means of communication and transport in the hands of the State. </li>
<li>7. Extension of factories and instruments of production owned by the State; the bringing into cultivation of waste-lands, and the improvement of the soil generally in accordance with a common plan. </li>
<li>8. Equal liability of all to work. Establishment of industrial armies, especially for agriculture. </li>
<li>9. Combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries; gradual abolition of all the distinction between town and country by a more equable distribution of the populace over the country. </li>
<li>10. Free education for all children in public schools. Abolition of children’s factory labour in its present form. Combination of education with industrial production, &amp;c, &amp;c.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your point that both systems are inextricably fascist is well received, as I have pointed this out prior on random interweb posts. Putin_loves_cats makes the salient point that any system as conceived is utopian, and will inevitably be subject to distortion by human corruption.</p>

<p>However, in a communist setup, the bankers are the state, the state are the bankers. Within a capitalist system, the banks maintain autonomy. This has huge implications for the use and availability of capital to speculators. Additionally, within communism, there are no owners of companies, there are no companies, just various state ministries and project managers who receive the same wages as the other proletarians. This is a pretty big difference. But back here in reality, things are often very mixed state, as in China, where there are most certainly companies and speculators who function under regulation of, but not as representatives of, the state. In reality, the differences between how China functions and how, ahem, another big economy functions are pretty minute. I mean, we all live under central banks, which are communist institutions. </p>

<p>While I agree that no state has ever reached the goal of Communism or Capitalism, I would site for that failing little else other than the design of those very figures who instituted the systems in the first place.</p>

<p>This is correct, but the end of pleb control is very much accomplished in both systems just the same.</p>

<p>Not if the private sector (corporations in capitalism) gets and exercises power no less ubiquitous than the state (as is the case in communism).  Then they’re both effectively the same.</p>

<p>A corporation that becomes so powerful that it can take over a state can do exactly the same thing you described a communist state as doing here.</p>
