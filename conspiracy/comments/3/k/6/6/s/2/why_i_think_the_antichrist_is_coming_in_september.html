<p>Rise of Donald Trump the court jester</p>

<p>Keep in mind the pedophile vatican and our own government have been corrupted by satanists and occultists for decades, and september, whether we believe it or not, is their month of sacrifice, the fall solstice represents the death of god (the son, or son of god) </p>

<p>Matthew 24:37 ...&#39;But as the days of Noah were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.&#39;
Luke 17:28-30 ...&#39;Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded; But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all. Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.</p>

<p>Gey marriage legalized

<ol>
<li><p>1 Timothy 4:1 ...&#39;Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils.&#39;
How about a rise in spiritualism and the occult in the world? Have we seen this? Well, just look at the television and movies today. &quot;Twilight&quot;, &quot;Harry Potter&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>mass animal deaths</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Hosea 4:3 ...&#39;Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.&#39; </p>

<p>&quot;The extent of this die-off, and the speed it had, by spreading throughout the whole calving herd and killing all the animals, this has not been observed for any other species,&quot; Zuther said. &quot;It&#39;s really unheard of.&quot; </p>

<p>This was THIS WEEK, 60,000 antelope dropped dead
if you picture an antelope it looks like a “positive” image of a satanic goat, possibly these are sacrifices</p>

<li>
Luke 21:25-26 ...&#39;and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring; Men&#39;s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.&#39; </li>
</ol>

<p>super storm sandy, hurricane katrina</p>

<p>Tsunamis and floods, and men&#39;s hearts are certainly fearing what is happening to this world. In America in 2010, a record was set for the number of Federal Disaster Declarations given over a year. That number was 81. In 2011, that number was broken again, with 99 Disaster Declarations given, costing over 32 Billion Dollars. And 2012 produced another year of record breaking disasters. Dr. Robert Hartwig states ... &quot;The number of U.S. disaster declarations has been trending sharply upward, particularly over the past 15 years.&quot; (Source) ... </p>

<p>End Time Sign - WORLD PUSHING FOR PEACE
1 Thessalonians 5:3 ...&#39;For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.&#39;</p>

<p>after the false flags and fake second coming, pope frances will call the world to peace at the UN</p>

Matthew 24:9-10 ...&#39;Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name&#39;s sake. And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.&#39;</p>

<p>ISIS is slaughtering christians right now</p>

<p>CHRISTIANS TURN AWAY FROM TRUTH
2 Timothy 4:3-4 ...&#39;For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.&#39;</p>

<p>September 12 – Madonna’s Rebel Heart Tour opens in the United States.  The first stop is in Washington D.C. and according to Holly Deyo the “opening theme is Desecration of The Bride and Arrival of Fallen Angels” 
satanic madonna tour about desecrating the bride of god and honoring the fallen angel satan.  Disgusting trash</p>

<p>Also on september 25 there is a huge satanic rave in georgia called Tomorrowland, the theme is the key of happiness.  This represents the key to the underworld mentioned in revelations

    <div class="md"><p>i hope it does :)</p>

<p>Matthew 24:41 says, “Two women will be grinding at the mill: one will be taken and the other left.” This verse links with a similar illustration in verse 40. A key to understanding the Bible is to examine a verse in its context. The full context begins in verse 36 with, “But of that day and hour [of Jesus Christ&#39;s second coming] no one knows.” It ends in verse 44 with, “Therefore you also be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.” Clearly, the topic is preparedness for Christ&#39;s second coming.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I swear I read quite a few doom posts like this that had September events leading right up to October 25th, and since you&#39;d collected a lot of this data I was wondering if you knew anything beyond this point.</p>

<p>The only reason I ask is because I personally liked Russell Brand&#39;s &quot;The Trews&quot; YouTube show... I feel like he spreads a good message to people about corruption in society and how we should all fight against it in positive ways.... but there are a lot of people that think he is a psy-op that dances around issues and provides a false sense of leadership so people constantly feel like they are on the verge of change but then do nothing about it.</p>

<p>Well I don&#39;t believe that&#39;s true, but strangely enough out of nowhere he ended his YouTube program and disappeared after spending all this time rallying people up. I thought he was just being an ass and running off to make money from touring instead of focusing on YouTube, but his latest &quot;world&quot; tour is short as shit - he&#39;s doing nothing in September at all, and it only starts in October where he does a few short dates with his last in Australia on Oct 24.</p>

<p>This makes me curiously wonder if maybe he and other celebrities/wealthy folk/etc are getting the hell out of dodge for the moment... I mean it&#39;s probably just coincidence but it does make me think that if we watch the social elite and a lot of them are going quiet for the next month or two it would actually add some weight to these otherwise far-fetched conspiracy theories revolving around sept-oct.</p>

<p>Youre absolutely right, I would call them false prophets.  Obviously none of them claim to be prophets, but they use the media to turn celebrity worship into a religion in its own right, and then they continuously let us down (hope and change?)</p>

<p>Let me know if you find anything interesting about the elite changing plans, fleeing, doing anything unusual.  Keep an extra eye on Denver airport </p>

<p>I don&#39;t really know much more then that, just the general fact that you can always look to the people in power when huge &quot;totally unexpected&quot; things like this happen, like 9/11.  That would be the romans.  Honestly though, I don&#39;t believe it.  I believe he was real, and was really the son of god, but his message was twisted and distorted by the satanists who have been bringing the plan I wrote about to fruition. The most compelling evidence for me though is those two verses I quoted in my last post, cause those definitely dont seem like words jesus would say if he was for real, being the anarchist he kinda was.  Whatever you believe, its fascinating stuff and its hard to think of anything more meaningful to talk about.</p>

<p>Absolutely this is true.  We are indeed all one.  Since we are all one, however, it cannot be said, as you mentioned above, that &quot;God has NOTHING to do with this.&quot;</p>

<p>God has EVERYTHING to do with this.  Indeed, God IS this...of <em>necessity</em>.  That doesn&#39;t mean God isn&#39;t also all the other things in existence that work against what &quot;this&quot; is, mind you, but God is also most definitely &quot;this&quot; as well.</p>

<p>The weird and seemingly paradoxical thing about this is that even the anti-God <em>is still God</em>, for God is everything, and &quot;everything&quot; includes the yin and the yang, the positive and the negative, the up, the down, and everything in between.</p>

<p>As such, perhaps the true lesson is not necessarily one of choosing the positive over the negative...but of transcending both.</p>

<p>No. We are all <em>from</em> one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No.  We are all one.  Look up the holographic model of existence.  Everything is literally everything.  Even the limited, corporate sham which we have on this planet masquerading as real science has already arrived at this conclusion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If we were truly one there would be no diversity or point in having more than one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unity can compartmentalize itself and create a myriad of separate identities, yet <em>still</em> be one.  Take people with schizophrenia, as but one indicative example.  Sybil Dorsett was said to have as many as sixteen different personalities - various of which had exactly no idea about the existence of the others.</p>

<p>Essentially, God can be visualized as a Sybil Dorsett that separated Itself out into a googolplexian identities throughout existence.   Just as Sybil’s 16 different personalities were each at different stages of awareness with regard to who/what they were and what their relationship was to the true, “host” identity that they in fact were ultimately one with, each of the limitless number of identities that God separated Itself out into is at a different level of awareness and understanding with regard to its ultimate unity with and <em>as</em> God.</p>

<p>Everything is One at different stages of Self awareness/God Consciousness.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>God started this but god is not in control or in charge or even influencing anything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>God, literally by definition, is the word that humans have for “Everything that is”.  In other words, God is omnipotent (all powerful), omnipresent (everywhere), and omniscient (all knowing).  Again, strictly Philosophically-speaking, this is the case <em>necessarily</em>.  If the thing a person calls “God” <em>doesn’t</em> have these qualities, then it, by definition, cannot be “God” (i.e. the word humans have for “everything that is”).  As such, since God <em>is</em> indeed all powerful, God <em>is</em> in fact very much in control and in charge of everything there is.  In fact, “everything there is” actually <em>IS</em> God Itself.</p>

<p>Seems paradoxical, but these are the logical implications of these axioms.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lots o words, no sense.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lots o sense.  No understanding.  That’s not the fault of the words or their meaning.  That’s the fault of the reader.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even if you don&#39;t believe in God as a deity you have a fundamental misunderstanding of God. God is the source of energy. All energy. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>God is not only the source of all energy, God - of necessity - <em>IS</em> all energy.  Given that God is all energy, then, it most certainly seems that it is, in fact, <em>you</em> that has the fundamental misunderstanding here.  You are contradicting your very self and do not even understand that you’re doing it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no necessity, plan, destiny, wish, hope, or any other energetic manifestation of human emotion that can be prescribed to this source energy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There absolutely is.  It’s just that Source is also <em>beyond</em> such descriptions.  Source is comprised of the descriptions given to It, but It is also yet more still.  Its being more still, however, does not contradict a limited description of It - so long as that limited description is acknowledged as such.  Therefore, while limiting descriptions used here do apply, they are not ultimately all-encompassing.  In other words, they are “necessary but not sufficient” descriptions of God.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The source of this energy aka god cannot be known cannot be explained.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is 100% correct, but applies most saliently when attempting a cosmic illustration of Source.  Within the context of limited human understanding, however, there are at least logical, rational implications that the words used to attempt to describe God of necessity have.  Those logical implications can be either logically valid, or logically <em>in</em>valid, and they can be judged and assessed on those particular merits.</p>

<p>It is understood that in the <em>ultimate</em> end of things, our little, human descriptions here on this planet are all for naught.  However, our grasping of certain perspectives from this lowly vantage point still should nonetheless be as clear as they possibly can be.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That leaves us all responsible for our individual thoughts and actions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is nothing I’ve stated that should lead anyone to think that I was implying anything other than this.  God being Everything does not abdicate the responsibility that the individual themselves has to still manifest Cosmic Consciousness as best as they possibly can.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For at least a few thousand years a small group of individuals have exploited this knowledge to their benefit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There has definitely been a group that has exploited much of the human species for a very, very long time indeed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They undermine the freedom of our thoughts and manipulate our perception with an overdose on fear. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Among other things, yes, this is correct.  Fear is one of the biggest tools used.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This isn&#39;t because they&#39;re divine or superior to all others but instead it is because they themselves are fearful and disconnected from their nature.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Divine?  No less than any other manifestation necessarily is.</p>

<p>Superior?  Well, some beings are much more evolutionarily advanced than others.  That much is certainly true.  That might be classified as “superior” by some.  That need never keep anyone from still becoming as competent and self-guiding a being as possible, however.</p>

<p>Fearful and disconnected?  Perhaps.  Perhaps not.  I imagine some beings manipulating humanity might very well be fearful and disconnected, but I wouldn’t supposed all of them to be.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I mean no disrespect and agree with a lot of the comments you make. I respect your thoughts, I just disagree with a few.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thank you for saying this.  Fair enough then.  Glad we are not “fighting”.  People can disagree without being unnecessarily antagonistic to one another.  Apologies for any harshness above.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Seems that way - yes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thus no point in anything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps ultimate union with and <em>as</em> Object is something so out of the jurisdiction of our ability to cognize and abstract about that we can’t even fathom if there would or wouldn’t be a point one way or the other.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The point is for the natural course of creating beings to experience something completely new but still within the system of &quot;god&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sounds about right…and as the creating beings continue to experience more and more “somethings” within the system of “God”, a greater level of understanding and awareness develops whereby the being in question understands more and more what their true self and true identity really is…and as they understand more and more and grow greater in their understanding, they arrive at a closer and closer level of cosmic consciousness/cosmic unity.  The being imbues the ability to identify more and more things as part of it’s true greater Self.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>there is nothing to experience besides God.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly this.  God, of course, is limitless, so the experiencing of the Self can be concomitantly expansive.  This reminds me of a quote by the great <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swami_Vivekananda">Swami Vivekananda</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>God is a circle whose circumference is nowhere, but whose center is everywhere.  <del>He</del> It works through all hands, sees through all eyes, walks on all feet, breathes through all bodies, lives in all life, speaks through every mouth, and thinks through every brain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would ad to this that God is no less the dog, cat, running stream, blazing fire, or the air or tree or mountain than anything else.  God is, again, everything.</p>

<p>Matthew 24:41 says, “Two women will be grinding at the mill: one will be taken and the other left.” This verse links with a similar illustration in verse 40. A key to understanding the Bible is to examine a verse in its context. The full context begins in verse 36 with, “But of that day and hour [of Jesus Christ&#39;s second coming] no one knows.” It ends in verse 44 with, “Therefore you also be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.” Clearly, the topic is preparedness for Christ&#39;s second coming.</p>

<p>No.  We are all one.  Look up the holographic model of existence.  Everything is literally everything.  Even the limited, corporate sham which we have on this planet masquerading as real science has already arrived at this conclusion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If we were truly one there would be no diversity or point in having more than one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unity can compartmentalize itself and create a myriad of separate identities, yet <em>still</em> be one.  Take people with schizophrenia, as but one indicative example.  Sybil Dorsett was said to have as many as sixteen different personalities - various of which had exactly no idea about the existence of the others.</p>

<p>Essentially, God can be visualized as a Sybil Dorsett that separated Itself out into a googolplexian identities throughout existence.   Just as Sybil’s 16 different personalities were each at different stages of awareness with regard to who/what they were and what their relationship was to the true, “host” identity that they in fact were ultimately one with, each of the limitless number of identities that God separated Itself out into is at a different level of awareness and understanding with regard to its ultimate unity with and <em>as</em> God.</p>

<p>Everything is One at different stages of Self awareness/God Consciousness.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>God started this but god is not in control or in charge or even influencing anything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>God, literally by definition, is the word that humans have for “Everything that is”.  In other words, God is omnipotent (all powerful), omnipresent (everywhere), and omniscient (all knowing).  Again, strictly Philosophically-speaking, this is the case <em>necessarily</em>.  If the thing a person calls “God” <em>doesn’t</em> have these qualities, then it, by definition, cannot be “God” (i.e. the word humans have for “everything that is”).  As such, since God <em>is</em> indeed all powerful, God <em>is</em> in fact very much in control and in charge of everything there is.  In fact, “everything there is” actually <em>IS</em> God Itself.</p>

<p>Seems paradoxical, but these are the logical implications of these axioms.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lots o words, no sense.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lots o sense.  No understanding.  That’s not the fault of the words or their meaning.  That’s the fault of the reader.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even if you don&#39;t believe in God as a deity you have a fundamental misunderstanding of God. God is the source of energy. All energy. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>God is not only the source of all energy, God - of necessity - <em>IS</em> all energy.  Given that God is all energy, then, it most certainly seems that it is, in fact, <em>you</em> that has the fundamental misunderstanding here.  You are contradicting your very self and do not even understand that you’re doing it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no necessity, plan, destiny, wish, hope, or any other energetic manifestation of human emotion that can be prescribed to this source energy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There absolutely is.  It’s just that Source is also <em>beyond</em> such descriptions.  Source is comprised of the descriptions given to It, but It is also yet more still.  Its being more still, however, does not contradict a limited description of It - so long as that limited description is acknowledged as such.  Therefore, while limiting descriptions used here do apply, they are not ultimately all-encompassing.  In other words, they are “necessary but not sufficient” descriptions of God.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The source of this energy aka god cannot be known cannot be explained.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is 100% correct, but applies most saliently when attempting a cosmic illustration of Source.  Within the context of limited human understanding, however, there are at least logical, rational implications that the words used to attempt to describe God of necessity have.  Those logical implications can be either logically valid, or logically <em>in</em>valid, and they can be judged and assessed on those particular merits.</p>

<p>It is understood that in the <em>ultimate</em> end of things, our little, human descriptions here on this planet are all for naught.  However, our grasping of certain perspectives from this lowly vantage point still should nonetheless be as clear as they possibly can be.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That leaves us all responsible for our individual thoughts and actions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is nothing I’ve stated that should lead anyone to think that I was implying anything other than this.  God being Everything does not abdicate the responsibility that the individual themselves has to still manifest Cosmic Consciousness as best as they possibly can.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For at least a few thousand years a small group of individuals have exploited this knowledge to their benefit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There has definitely been a group that has exploited much of the human species for a very, very long time indeed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They undermine the freedom of our thoughts and manipulate our perception with an overdose on fear. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Among other things, yes, this is correct.  Fear is one of the biggest tools used.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This isn&#39;t because they&#39;re divine or superior to all others but instead it is because they themselves are fearful and disconnected from their nature.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Divine?  No less than any other manifestation necessarily is.</p>

<p>Superior?  Well, some beings are much more evolutionarily advanced than others.  That much is certainly true.  That might be classified as “superior” by some.  That need never keep anyone from still becoming as competent and self-guiding a being as possible, however.</p>

<p>Fearful and disconnected?  Perhaps.  Perhaps not.  I imagine some beings manipulating humanity might very well be fearful and disconnected, but I wouldn’t supposed all of them to be.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I mean no disrespect and agree with a lot of the comments you make. I respect your thoughts, I just disagree with a few.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thank you for saying this.  Fair enough then.  Glad we are not “fighting”.  People can disagree without being unnecessarily antagonistic to one another.  Apologies for any harshness above.</p>
