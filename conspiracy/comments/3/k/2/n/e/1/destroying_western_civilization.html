<p>With the recent immigration of undesirables into Germany, it is clear that one of the major pieces to the puzzle to the end of strong European nations is to open the borders to the point where fear and chaos are so organized that the public loses all ability to regain control of their land and home.</p>

<p>It is important to realize that with the cultural shift of Europeans to breed less, import more and to tolerate, they have become second class citizens in their own lands. There are African countries and Asian countries and even a jewish military state exists but white European nations are gone. Once the determination of culture and progress, now breeding grounds for terrorists and welfare cases. Europeans are scared to be who they are in their own lands. They fight for the rights of everyone but themselves. They&#39;ve been manipulated by social revolutions not their own to be afraid to have an opinion except that which is manufactured for them. One deemed politically correct by the media that doesn&#39;t represent their interests. Owned by those who work with governments that do not represent our interests. When do we say no? When we are starving? We are. When European women are being raped? They are. When we are dying? We are.</p>

<p>They are importing these worthless people to:
1. Create chaos as a distraction from the plundering going on</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create an enemy that certain groups want us to hate so that they can continue the war effort in the middle-East indefinitely.</p></li>
<li><p>Reduce voting power</p></li>
<li><p>Eliminate the value structure that once made European nations noble and civilized. Political groups have destroyed the family unit and core values leaving individuals to waste away thinking they are fulfilling themselves when really their people are being destroyed.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a fearful, pacified public that can&#39;t defend itself.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>America&#39;s zionist-directed war created the refugees we see sweeping the West. Why is Europe and why is Canada and why are Americans forced to bare the destruction? Should it not be the people who should determine when war is necessary and who should be allowed into their countries? Why are politicians using these people that their war agendas have created as a tool against our emotions?</p>

<p>We need to let our respective governments know that the crime rates and lower standards of living are unacceptable to us. Our taxes are being used to clean up the wars they&#39;ve fought with our taxes so corporations can evade taxes and use us to further their monopolies of the planet. They are turning our countries into communist labour paradises for the rich. When are we going to say no?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So it&#39;s ok to spend 300 or 400 years meddling in foreign politics, thieving natural resources from various colonial empires and impoverishing their people, regulating trade from an impenetrable private banking empire, manipulating international events from a position of strength - and then whinging when the whole house of cards collapses:</p>

<p>These other crappy people, they don&#39;t belong here! They want our food, they want our health care, they want our housing! Make these infidels go away, back to the sand dunes where they belong. (but of course they <em>must</em> send us gas and oil for the cheapest possible price) - because.....um</p>

<p>It took the better part of two or three centuries for Europe to arrive at this point. The piper will now be paid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This my friend, is a question from all of history - why are the little people forced to pay the price for bad decisions made by the governments and financiers who run the show?</p>

<p>You tell me.</p>

<p>These little people include the refugees who are now desperately trying to find a place and a way to survive. They are paying the price for bad governance and policies going back in time, and covering hundreds of years of financial extraction.</p>

<p>All of the little people, you &amp; me &amp; they - we are all now in the stew.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Short answer, it&#39;s because us little people were born into a social theme that strips our self esteem from birth. </p>

<p>We need to realize our strengths and individuality is exactly the same as the self proclaimed &quot;elites&quot;. </p>

<p>Educating people on their personal greatness without pushing your individual opinions on them is the only way to have natural peace.</p>

<p>Yes, we can not advance if we do not all recognize what is our fault, which is different for every person.</p>

<p>The country failing currently is not my fault, I am only 26 so that is literally impossible for the housing market failing to be my fault.</p>

<p>It IS, however, the fault of all those involved in every aspect of the situation such as people taking out 2nd and 3rd mortgages to &quot;improve&quot; their house to make it cost even more so even less people can afford it, those sub-prime mortgages given to people who could not pay them, etc.</p>

<p>If your state is failing financially yet you refuse to attempt to end the state lottery, then you are a part of the problem as that is a 100% drain on the entire state economy.</p>

<p>There is no excuse for doing nothing and allowing nonsense to persist.</p>

<p>It is not fictitious, it is real and they have physical law enforcement agents who use physical force and violence to enforce their state apparatus, which is anything but fictitious, throw that nonsense out the window right now.</p>

<p>You may not agree with the state, but do not be a fool and say it is not real. It may be a construct, yes, but it is a very real one.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>They are not &quot;made up&quot;, they are real entities staffed by real human beings, who are responsible for their actions individually.</p>

<p>That is who is being blamed, sometimes it is &quot;one of us&quot;, which is why at times we must blame &quot;each other&quot;.</p>

<p>How so? Recapitulate your point because I am not seeing it.</p>

<p>Duh?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People do things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Duh?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A state, government, etc can&#39;t do anything because they aren&#39;t real.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, they can do things because they are real entities staffed by real humans, making them real as an entity.</p>

<p>Entity- Noun - an organization (as a business or governmental unit) that has an identity separate from those of its members.</p>

<p>The members of the government are people, yes, but the government is not fake because of that, it is an entity, and entities are real.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People are real and real people cause problems under the fiction of a non human entity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The entity is not a fiction, it is real.</p>

<p>There is literally nothing fictitious about our governmental entities, they are not just ideas imagined, they are actual legal bodies written into law with physical buildings and funding, nothing about that is fictitious.</p>

<p>You are using definitions incorrectly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can&#39;t take a picture of a state</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can actually because a state has literally defined borders which designate specific portions of land as being grouped together.</p>

<p>&quot;America&quot; is not &quot;real&quot; as in this physical piece of land is only called &quot;America&quot; because people call it that, but that land mass that is called &quot;America&quot; is &quot;America&quot; because that land mass only exists there and nowhere else.</p>

<p>I can also take a picture of a corporation, either their buildings or the people which make up the corporation, both pictures are pictures of a corporation as they both make up a corporation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you can only take a picture of people, places and things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, and the state of Illinois is a physical place which I can photograph, I can even photograph the entire thing at once from an airplane.</p>

<p>These geographical coordinates are not imaginary bro.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are brainwashed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, you are delusional and do not know how word definitions work, and think that you have overcome all forms of mind control when clearly you have been brainwashed yourself into being a &quot;sovereign man&quot;.</p>

<p>Have fun with that one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How is that relevant to the influx of refugees into Europe <em>right now</em>?</p>

<p>This catastrophe has been centuries in the making. The banking, mercantile, and colonial empires of Europe of the 18th/19th/20th centuries in farflung empirical lands is coming back for the haunting now.</p>

<p>Samuel Pepys will not pay the price, contemporary Europeans will. There is no point in debating what if this had happened or what if they had done that, or why did these infidels not ride off on their camels 200 years ago.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>how is this relevant you ask - well, Europe is taking refugees in (due to it being developed), and not the other way around. yes indeed - colonialism is at the root of the problem, but it is not the main cause. don&#39;t get me wrong - EU supported US of A in its &quot;world police&quot; approach to the world - and it did wrong. and now these are the consiquences. and yet what puzzles me is why did the middle east &amp; africa never developed a strong, influential culture. people there never developed &quot;modern societies&quot;, for good or bad. and it is due to this fact, that when war is at their door, they come to the conclusion &quot;We&#39;ll go to Europe, because it is the most developed place we know of&quot;. Why don&#39;t the majority of refugees go to Kazakhstan, or Pakistan, or India &amp; China? Because they thought about it like &quot;since we&#39;re going to leave everything of our former lives behind, we might as well go and start over at the best place available&quot; - EU

    <div class="md"><p>Why are you asking me why Africa never developed this or never developed that? What kind of answer do you expect, and how do you suppose such an answer might change anything? It&#39;s immaterial now. Coulda, woulda, shoulda.</p>

<p>In 2015 we are witnessing the unravelling of the western empires built on the extraction of resources from colonial empires. It is hundreds of years in the making, and it is not going to be pretty. Many people may die. Many of those people might not be just third world people, but first world people may be lost as well in attempt to maintain the status quo for the elite pulling the strings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m from Bulgaria, and I would like to warn you all that this policy that the EU is now following (&quot;tolerate everything, don&#39;t stand up for anything&quot;) has already been applied to us - our population was dumbed down to the minimal, our social system was destroyed, all in the wake of the &quot;democracy&quot; for which people were hungry after the end of the communist regime, our gipsy minorities have been groomed to never &quot;integrate&quot; into society by enormous internal and external organizations, but instead spread chaos and discontent, pillage our dying countryside freely, occupy whichever house they choose, and always get protection from the &quot;law enforcements&quot;. And I am really really afraid to see the same processes currently developing in the EU. I am not xenophobic, nor religious, but if an aggressive culture\religion (such as Islam) tries to take over and assimilate my culture, it is only natural to be against it. 
So fellow dwellers of beautiful Europe, the cradle of civilization as we know it, the birthplace of so many great minds who have changed the lives of all humans, are we going to just stand by and watch as these people invade and destroy our homes, just because we are told to be &quot;tolerant&quot;? Isn&#39;t it time we remind the world that Europe has survived so many and so bloody and so costly wars and conflicts, and its people will not bow down to anyone, even each-other? Isn&#39;t it time we stood together, as always in times of crisis, just like when the Ottomans or the Nazi invaded? Remember that the ancients believed that the gods lived on our very land, and that is why our continent is named after Zeus&#39;s daughter.</p>

This has been proven times and times again, by the few still indipendent media (some of which no longer exist). People don&#39;t care. They prefer to take it to each other, instead of uniting against the enemy, because it&#39;s safer and easier.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I prefer to look at it as people don&#39;t know. They seem like they don&#39;t care to those who know. If we want more people to care then we have to let more people know. In order to let more people know we have to be humble in our approach and educate without admonishing them. We also have to educate them their way not the way we think they should be taught. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People are way too fat, docile and domesticated to fix the problem. In fact, they can&#39;t even admit the problem. Some outright deny it and try to hand you a tinfoil  hat. It&#39;s a brave new world.</p>

<p>You have to fix people before you can fix governments. I don&#39;t know how you fix the emasculated <del>man</del> eunuch who celebrates his ignorance and castration. Maybe take away their pokemon toys and anime? <em>shrug</em></p>

<p>This, so much this.</p>

<p>People wonder why we have shitty politicians/government. Well, we have a shitty ignorant/greedy/materialistic populous. Garbage in, garbage out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>George Carlin aside, this doesn&#39;t explain why Europeans in general can be murdered and raped and stolen from by immigrants and minorities and then champion their causes and totally disregard their own.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a sophisticated social construct at play that is causing Europeans to forget every value they held dear and to even betray and forget their families to set out on a path of self destruction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, as you know, every idea you hold is discrimination. It does not matter what it is. Discernment is discrimination. So, any time you hold one idea, you deny another.</p>

<p>Now we have labels for everything. If you have nationalistic interests, you&#39;re racist and xenophobic. If you say men have qualities you&#39;re a sexist. If you believe in protecting your own, you&#39;re ignorant and inhumane. If you believe in any tradition you&#39;re obsolete because... I have a smartphone and have shared my shitty ideas with thousands of shitty people who still live in a townbox.</p>

<p>No matter what you do, you&#39;re homophobic, racist, sexist, a bigot, a nazi, stupid, ignorant, etc etc... Therefor, to avoid this label, you must be okay with anything someone wishes to inflict upon you, your home, your country. </p>

<p>People are terrified of having a label because they don&#39;t have any convictions or vision. However, I still lay the fault on each individual&#39;s shoulder who enables this new reality. Social engineering is just a tool being used to accomplish the deconstruction of stability and sense. It&#39;s not that it turns people into sheep, but merely reveals them for the sheep that they are.</p>

<p>I am an american, but  all of Europe west of Russia is currently under the same engineering, and just as susceptible to it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously each individual should work to better themselves but realistically until the parasites are seen for what they are there will be strife. </p>

<p>The new age bs of be the change you wish to see blah blah blah is fluffy rhetoric. </p>

<p>Once you change yourself to what you wish to be then you still need to live with and near others who may not wish the same change as you. </p>

<p>The goal is cooperation and individual responsibility, for everyone not just the have nots. </p>

<p>These people flooding Europe wouldn&#39;t be there if they had homelands intact. They also wouldn&#39;t leave a place they were born in such large numbers. </p>

<p>Sure some folk like to migrate but most just like to travel and go back to their comfort zones richer in human experience.</p>

<p>The parasites of this world need standing up to, they foment this global problem. Changing yourselves will open your eyes to the meddling of parasites and hopefully encourage us to correct their behavior. At the very least strip them of any and all authority. </p>

<p>Europeans were the latest people&#39;s in history to promote and propagate a great culture. Fight this like your ancestors would have fought if they were living in modern times. </p>
