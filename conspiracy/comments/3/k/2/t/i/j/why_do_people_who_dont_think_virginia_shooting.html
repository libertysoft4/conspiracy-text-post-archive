<p>&quot;See that murder that happened live on TV - Fake&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;See that video footage from the camera man - Fake&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;See that other footage, from the killer - Fake&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;See that Facebook account of the killer - Fake&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;See those dead bodies - Fake&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;See that autopsy - Fake&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;See that coroner and all those policemen and all the hundreds of other people who become involved - All actors&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;See that funeral - Fake&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;See all those people at the funerals. All the friends and families - Actors&quot;</p>

<p>How about you start with the families. How did the conspirators convince the families to pretend their loved-ones are dead.</p>

<p>And how did they convince the hoax &#39;victims&#39; to leave their lives behind and disappear forever?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Be careful about asking logical questions, you are in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> after all.  People here will just cherry-pick facts to support their arguments and ignore the bigger picture.  When you start asking the big questions like &quot;how&quot; and &quot;why&quot;, their stories tend to fall apart.  But unlike normal people, your average conspiracy theorist will ignore your reason and will dig in deeper and just end up pissing you off.  Always keep in mind: if you could reason with conspiracy theorists, there wouldn&#39;t be conspiracy theorists :)</p>

<p>When someone&#39;s ideological stance has them calling up the homes of people who&#39;s child/spouse/mother/father just died on live television, insisting it&#39;s a hoax and they should apologize to the country, then their ideological stance is cancerous to society.

<p>I think you&#39;re missing the point. What the conspiracy community does is assume that rather than one psychopath being responsible, they&#39;re assuming there are literally hundreds of them working in concert. The ridiculous inability to evaluate evidence fairly due to a mistrust of other people is the problem. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>ha, whatever. you should unserstand people before you judge. You think everybody who sees lies in the news is rediculous, unable to evaluate, filled with mistrust, -- but do you know this really? I&#39;ll tell you for a fact itls your own prejudice. I am none of those things and I&#39;ve never been accused of any of those things in my life with people who have real life experience with me. it&#39;s just not me, and I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not most people who think about this stuff, or talk about it. to talk about in a forum like this for example - I have to take insults from people like you - and apprecuatively you are much nicer even than many. do I like this? ha, no. I am not a masochist at all. I get nothing positive out of insults on line, but yet I keep talking - a lot of people keep talking, and I ( and I think most if not all) do it because we want to share what we see. literally I do not want you to be duped by the TV. now you say I&#39;m wrong - you are not getting duped, ok. fair enough.  are you saying that because you are paraniod and mistrustful of me and think I&#39;m personally out to get you? I&#39;d wager you just think I&#39;m very wrong and it&#39;s not about me and you. and you dont feel paranoid of me. because you do not have to be paraniod or mistrustful to say - I do not believe in what you are saying. people suffer a lot of harrassmemt to say - I think we are being lied to. and yet they keep saying it -- because they/we/I see evidence of it. you want to debate evidence -- great. but quit it with your character assasination. two people can see something very diffently - and they can both be quite reasonably level headed people. you have to take time to understand where other people are coming from. and drop the insults, you are not speaking from personal knowledge on that part and it shows. </p>

<p>Could you please tell me where in my post I stated that? I&#39;m having trouble finding it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>so you can&#39;t stop thinknig critically just because possible suffering is a factor. you have to still examine facts if you suspect you are being lied to, despite the fear of offending. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again I can&#39;t find where in my post I said that suffering meant you can ignore facts. Could you point out where I said that?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>take note these people are sking for something in the name of their suffering. they all have immediatey started fundraising for themselves, and they all immediately start lobbying hard for gun control. and sometimes other political asks. laws are being challenged in the name of this suffering. and in many cases have already been rewritten. and miliions of $ is being raised in the name of his suffering, if not much more. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m wasn&#39;t aware that gun control legislation has already been passed in response to this shooting. Could I perhaps see a source about that? I&#39;d also like to ask where you got your numbers on donation numbers as well as what you mean by &quot;political asks.&quot; Just curious. </p>

<p>So if I understand your argument, you think that because the loved ones of the victims are liars because...why? They aren&#39;t sad enough? If one of my loved ones were killed by a gunman, you can bet that I&#39;d be wishing for gun control legislation. I think that&#39;s a pretty natural reaction to have. And I think some donation money wouldn&#39;t be bad either. You can criticize that, but at the end of the day it isn&#39;t evidence of a hoax.</p>

<p>If I&#39;m being honest though, I think the main reason I get angry when people say it was a hoax is because it demonstrates a lack of empathy. It&#39;d be another thing to suggest it was a hoax if they had real evidence, but when they have no evidence its utterly disgusting. They aren&#39;t trying to think about what those people are going through and instead just think &quot;they aren&#39;t sad enough, must be lying.&quot; They ignore the fact that people are dead and instead fixate on how they think those close to the tragedy should react and if they don&#39;t react the way they expect them to react they cry hoax.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t, I said pathological skepticism, which is different. If you have good reason to be skeptical of a particular thing then great. But to be skeptical of everything is extreme, that indicates a disconnection from reality. </p>

<p>Is it reasonable to be skeptical that we know the whole story? Sure. But is it reasonable to be skeptical we know <em>any</em> of the story? No, not without a lot of concrete evidence. And I do not mean circumstantial evidence either,  if you spend a lot of time looking for confirmation of your belief you can make damn near anything fit that narrative, but that sort of weak evidence is open to interpretation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure you may ask. I&#39;ll attempt to answer. some background, there was a time about a year ago I was oblivious to people thinking news events were hoaxes - for any reason more than -- I don&#39;t even know what, nonsense I guess. I occasionally saw something about people say somethinf was a hoax - but I never clicked on it, and never thought smart people were saying it. to me - it was as interesting as something about bigfoot or aliens - inotherwords not interesting at all. Then - one day - still unrealted to all this a friend told me to watch the documentary loose change.  I&#39;d never heard of it - he told me it was about the conspiracy abut 9/11 (he&#39;d never seen it either) but he thought I&#39;d like it since at the time I was interested in something about china and where all their pollution was coming from - which was a vaguely similar topic - though realy not at all anyway - it&#39;s not that important - through somewhat random circumstances I was recomended a movie and I watched it. and by the time I was done watching I was blown away. I saw, without question - there was coverup in the official investigation of 9/11. and there had to be more that brought those buildings down and made them fall as they did than just the planes hitting them. I was in awe. I hadn&#39;t realized the evidence for explosives at the base of the buildings was so apparent - but it was. expert after expert - demonstrated why. it was about physics and architecture, and but -- the 9/11 commission not only insisted there were no explosives used they also claimed they did not need to test for any. and did not test for any. this blew my mind, it would be one thing to truly run a gunch of tests - find no explosives an then say - strange but true t really was just the planes - but to refuse to even test - despite overwhelminf please from families of victims and public at large - inexcuseable. ……and what this meat for me was - I can no longer blindly trust the gov an the media - all parties telling the incomplete story as if it is complete. </p>

<p>franky I didn&#39;t know what to do with this realization for a while - but it opened my mind - freaked me the hell out - and led me to realize - there are tons of issues people say are being covered up ,I started thinking - well maybe there is truth here where I always assumed there wasn;t, and I started doing research. I found a lot of stuff I wasn&#39;t sure about , a lot of grey areas - but at some point I stumbled on the boston bombing stuff - I guess it was a couple years after the actual event - and I saw all these postings and videos saying it aws a hoax - and I was like what?! this is just too weird for me, I do not know what they are talking about. I mean yes I could listen to the idea that the fBI was really behind it for some reason  - but you are saying that guy who got his legs blown off is an actor? this is too weird. </p>

<p>but little things I saw - caught my attention. I have some medical knowledge and also a lot of theater experience -- and as I let myself look at the examples they were giving I had what might have been a worse shuddering of change in perspective than in 9/11. I could see the unjuries were inconsistent with real injuries, I could see actors emoting falsley - and othertimes resting calmly as they were not the focus of a photograph. once I starter to really look - it was the most crazy -- I can&#39;t deny what I&#39;m seeing feeling. I probably spent a few months rewatvching - finding more phtos and videos, it was such a huge leap to make, even when I was sure - part of me was like well it just can&#39;t be - I&#39;m being tricked somehow - but eventually I saw - the facts before me, despite how it shattered my reality. and despite the fact that I can&#39;t figure how all media is complacent with the playacting. or how they fool most of them too - if that&#39;s what is happening. I do not know why this was done - I do not know who did it - I do not know what it took to pull it off - but yes  -- all those people lying there are pretending. </p>

<p>one I realize this is possible - that news can be staged - I picked up on that there were other events people identify as staged. I actally called my mother and told her what I thought I&#39;d figured out and she said back when oklahoma city happened a lot of people said the same thing - that there was something odd about it. I looked at pictures of that one and they looked real to me, so I wasn&#39;t sure what to think of it -- but it confirmed to me that there is a history or some kind of deception with some very publicized crisis. </p>

<p>I looked into sandy hook. I&#39;ll tell you I can not figure out that one. I think maybe some kids did die,  but that the people who went on tv to talk about losing their parents are not being genuine. I am not one to want to offend at all. It&#39;s the compelling evidence I saw in boston bombing where the evidence is so apparent - that makes me recognize the pattern of unrealistic victim press conferences in this one. </p>

<p>and then I started to pick up patterns that signify fakery. -- all the &quot;bad guys&quot; in all these events are represente by the same pair of lawyers. even back to oklahoma city, to boston, to charleston, to virginia. all of them shun &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; as if those who question the event are even lower than the perpetrators themselves. all victims parents immediately lobby for gun control. not one skips a beat, has some other way of channeling their grief. the &quot;bad guy&#39;s&quot; motives are always political hot buttons, never personal or too hard to decipher, or about money or sex, as motives usually are. the media always knows too much too soon, they will say &quot; a picture is just starting to emerge -- and then tell you the exact age, name, motive, of guilty guy and soon tell you where you can read his manifesto. if you actually read these manifestos they are always - clearly not written by the guy they are claiming wrote it. check out break down of charleston shooter&#39;s manifesto  - his is the most glaring example of this. </p>

<p>with virginia specifically. at fitst I didn&#39;t even click on the headline, but maybe a day after the event I read - somebody said something racist about the perp. and I was like -- oh - I bet it&#39;s a hoax. I did not think this because I don;t think people say racist things, I thought this becaue -- in the face of this kind of tragedy - how is some side comments relevant right now - it;s inflamatory to publicize it - but snce I know there is a media campaign to antagonize race tension - I know this was going to be a &quot;reaction&quot; to charleston. -- and then - boom - just a couple days later they go and say thats what the perp says &quot;drove him over the edge&quot; or whatever. I gotta say - if you really just try to let yourself see - you will see -- it;s threatics. it&#39;s WWF wrestling. whoever is doing this is akwardly trying to antagonize racial tension in america through fake - white on black/black on white murder. </p>

<p>of course both these types of crimes happen every day here, there are both white on black and black murder, but the real murders are not put on news and focussed on so much . and I think it&#39;s because they can not controll the narrative, the can not make it so purely about race - and so neatly tied up - bad guy always caught - no question if there was more to the story ever  - and the victims are always the most innocent good people the American imagination can come up with. this is unusual. though murder is never jusifed - there tends to be something the victims did to upset the murdered that explains rage - but in these cases all of them - always -- are ver very very goood people. so it&#39;s beyond inexcusable that they were targeted, -- and it&#39;s because it&#39;s scripted. I don;t mean each sentense spoken - but the story line - the characters, the evidence - how the story unfolds on the news - is all thought out to create an emotional journey for the american audience of a clear battle between good and evil. where good is given all our attention as victims and we will do whatever is necessary in their name - and evil is captured and destroyed - with no loose ends. </p>

<p>anyway, that&#39;s a part of why. really it&#39;s been a year of reseach to figre out how to recognize this stuff  - so i&#39;m sure this is not going to covr it if you don&#39;t go on some kind of similiar journey yourself. </p>

<p>also - of course watching the video and seeing nobody actually get shot - helped me see it was a hoax too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man at this point in time I can no longer tell what&#39;s real and what&#39;s fake in life... too much bullshit blends everything together. The Virginia shooting looked fake as hell, and yet in this crazy world we live in everything from the odd fps footage to the bizarre/soulless reaction of the family members &amp; loved ones could very well be real.</p>

<p>That being said it does surprise me the amount of people that avidly defend certain standpoints... like if I was of the belief that everything in MSM was true and the people that believed otherwise were completely nuts then I would stay away from them, not go out of my way to seek them out and argue the same thing/make the same statements over and over. It seems just as crazy as any conspiracy theory to actually want to do that, so it definitely makes me wonder why some people work so hard to derail a line of thought that 99% of people don&#39;t agree with or wouldn&#39;t believe anyways.</p>
