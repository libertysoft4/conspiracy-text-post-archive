To this day innocent people are being attacked and discriminated against simply because they are muslim. It&#39;s returning to 1930s Germany. We have the specific race baiting of the media between blacks and whites. We have the organised discrimination against other races.
This is all planned. It is all divide and conquer. A community can&#39;t come together as one if they are hateful and distrusting of each other. We have to work on making our local communities stronger, as the old saying goes, because united we stand, divided we fall.</p>

<p>You hit the nail on the head.    </p>

<p>This is one of the things that irks me about the ant-conspiracy crowd.  They always accuse &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; as being anti-semitic while overlooking the fact that the group of people demonized in our society the most is muslims.  If there is any parallel here it is between nazis hate of Judaism, and present day hate of Islam.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The agenda is culture and identity destruction, different cultures can co-exist just fine if they aren&#39;t too antagonist in ideology and if they are governed by a sufficiently democratic construct (true full democracy has not been seen since Cleisthene) . Identities are problematic because they resist the concentration of power at a larger scale... elsewhere. Quebec doesn&#39;t want to be ruled by Ottawa, Greeks by Bruxelles, Texans by Washington, etc... And the only reason a group can resist is identity, a shared set of values and beliefs that contradict finance&#39;s. So to break that, finance is shuffling everyone around. The fact that finance can distract anger from itself by throwing one community against another is just an added bonus to this larger scheme. Another added bonus is the pressure on the job market it creates.</p>

<p>Okay, all things aside, we don&#39;t know what the world will bring with the new changes. You can&#39;t just go saying &quot;Whites&quot; will be oppressed now. I don&#39;t think that is how this works, the people who are doing this have &quot;positive&quot; energy about them almost like magicians kinda like how people keep claiming all these shootings are fakes... what if they are? What if they are just propaganda to make us wake up and realize things... </p>

<p>I don&#39;t feel that whites will be oppressed, I feel that whites who stand for Zionism and the current oppression against all who are not white will feel the wrath of change. I think people who are good at heart who want to see change, want equality for everyone race color and gender will work out fine. I doubt the objective is to do the exact same thing back to &quot;whites&quot;, that just taints the revolution with an even scale, I would hope that the goal were to show them the correct way to run the world.</p>

<p>Either way, the coming changes in the future will be different for both man and human kind, we can&#39;t stop <strong>most</strong> of it, all we can do is just watch it happen, that&#39;s all this sub-reddit is, people watching the world spin...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well some moderate Muslims need to actually speak out against the jihadists in their ranks.  Moderate Muslims need to speak out against the bronze age punishments they use against people disobeying their religious laws and trying to leave the faith.  Moderate Muslims need to speak out against the attacks on people for free speech that Islam condones/encourages.  A community quite literally can&#39;t come together when a group of people believe they have a mandate from god to convert non-muslims or kill them.  This isn&#39;t just related to 9-11.  When the Ayatollah ordered the death of Salaman Rushdee for writing the Satanic Verses it was unanimously accepted by Muslims across the globe that he should be killed for blasphemy.  There was no outcry from the moderate Muslims saying that you shouldn&#39;t kill a man for writing a book.  Until the moderates who are willing to speak out are the majority there will be a problem with Islam.  As long as the majority of Muslims believe that the correct punishment for apostasy is death there will be a problem.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In this country&#39;s white people have been doing all the hate and killing. American Indians, slavery, chinese, Japanese camps, communist witch hunting of the 50s, actual witch hunts of the 1600s, mexicans, jews, government (timothy mcveigh), Muslims, corrupt cops. White people have even been racist against other white people. I site the Irish coming to this country. I don&#39;t blame white people. It&#39;s the history of this world. Always blame the guy below you. The problem with that is it&#39;s getting crowded below. By the way most minorities don&#39;t blame all white people just republicans. They might want to work on their image. Or whatever keep pretending like we&#39;re all one big happy family. Nothing is going to change until we ALL understand this country doesn&#39;t belong to one group. We all helped build this country. We all have to learn to forgive. It might be harder for others but we can do it.</p>

<p>Lol no we can&#39;t we&#39;re all selfish. We can&#39;t look past our small little world. For this world to get better we all have to care more about the other person but that&#39;s never going to happen. We&#39;re only interested in ourselves and maybe the people around us. Sure you have the few who care but there probably smaller in numbers then the rich elite. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree OP. I fucking hate SJW&#39;s but that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m a racist. It&#39;s really convenient that calling out neo-nazi&#39;s will now make people associate you with otherkin whining about micro agressions. The truth is that racism is a very real problem, and it&#39;s not about feelings, it&#39;s about the prison industrial complex, the rationalisation of genocide in the middle east, etc. 
It&#39;s a shit world. Divide and conquer is an age old cliché because it works. Rise above it and aim to connect all people, you can&#39;t convince people their hate is irrational but you can hope to be a beacon of sanity in an insane world. Best of luck.</p>

<p>Right, because who cares? I&#39;m not particularly interested in their mythology.</p>

<p>Lots of Muslims barely practice their faith and are Westernized. In their case, it hardly matters because they are hardly Muslim.</p>

<p>But those that take their faith seriously are required to support things (like death for apostasy) that are incompatible with Western ideas.</p>

<p>I bet you thought you were going to get a lot of brownie points for living in New York and knowing Muslims, but so has mostly every else. You are not special, not particularly more cosmopolitian than others, and Islam is <em>is</em> still foreign to the West and fundamentally incompatible with it.</p>
