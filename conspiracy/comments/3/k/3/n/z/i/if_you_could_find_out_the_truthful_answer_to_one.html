    <div class="md"><p>We already have a pretty good picture of what happened regarding JFK,   MLK,   Gulf of Tonkin,  even 9/11,  strangely enough.</p>

<p>On 9/11 it wasn&#39;t 19 terrorist hijackers,   they were patsies,   funded even through Pakistani generals who were on good terms with the white house,   and tracked as if they were assets of some kind of Intelligence service or services.     They were used as a diversion,   and something else happened,    as was the case with the Anthrax mailings,   that led the American people to support a trillion dollar fiasco that also ruined/ended thousands of American and Iraqi and Afghan and Libyan and Syrian etc.  lives for an outcome that was deemed worth it for a global elite,  which includes many wealthy and powerful Americans.</p>

<p>We know that.</p>

<p>What would be nice would be a proper investigation that would lead to putting those treasonous criminals on trial,  and would kick them out of their positions of power,    from which they continue,  daily,   to run an empire for personal gain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, don&#39;t forget their extensive training on the one and only Microsoft simulator. It&#39;s ridiculous to think some of these alleged hijacker pilots trained on this and were able to execute the mission. They wouldn&#39;t know what it&#39;s like flying a commercial aircraft under intense pressure. There&#39;s no way Hani Hanjour, shitty pilot could&#39;ve executed a 290° banked descending corkscrew turn and hit the Pentagon perfectly level with the ground at 540 mph.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah,  its hard to say what a &quot;president&quot; can get away with saying no to without getting an escort to Dealey Plaza.</p>

<p>At this point,  it has turned into a nightmare for so many and a nest egg for the one&#39;s who profited.    </p>

<p>But everyone knows that the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq,  especially Iraq,  were entered into under lies,  and most people by now know it had something to do with oil.    Funny how even Venezuela and Russia got dragged in on account of oil,  what to speak of Libya, Syria and the rest.   </p>

<p>And don&#39;t forget Paul Bremer,   who The day of 9/11, instead of going to work in the WTC where he would have been killed in the attacks Bremer instead went on MSNBC and gave the first implications of Osama Bin Laden as a suspect as well as possibly Iraq and Iran, and demanded &quot;the most severe military response possible.&quot; :</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bremer retired from the Foreign Service in 1989 and became managing director at Kissinger and Associates, a worldwide consulting firm founded by Henry Kissinger. A Career Member of the Senior Foreign Service, Class of Career Minister, Bremer received the State Department Superior Honor Award, two Presidential Meritorious Service Awards, and the Distinguished Honor Award from the Secretary of State. Before rejoining government in 2003, he was chairman and CEO of Marsh Crisis Consulting, a risk and insurance services firm which is a subsidiary of Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies.</p>

<p>He also served as a trustee on the Economic Club of New York,[3] and a board member of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., Akzo Nobel NV, the Harvard Business School Club of New York[4] and the Netherland-America Foundation. He served on the International Advisory Boards of Komatsu Corporation and Chugai Pharmaceuticals.</p>

<p>Bremer and 1,700 of the employees of Marsh &amp; McLennan had offices in the World Trade Center. Bremer&#39;s office was in the North Tower. In an interview with CNN after the September 11 attacks, he stated that their office was located &quot;above where the second aircraft hit&quot;</p>

Certainly this is when it became obvious who was actually running the show in the US if it hadn&#39;t been already, Wilson couldn&#39;t have been a more transparent shill for the bankers if he&#39;d tried.  Oh, did I say Wilson?  I meant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_M._House">Edward &quot;Colonel&quot; House</a>, the puppeteer to Wilson&#39;s puppet - and not an actual colonel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay I will try from memory. For starters the 1912 election is one of the strangest and most shrouded in mystery than any I can think of. THere were four mainstream candidates, Debs, Wilson, Taft, Roosevelt. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election%2C_1912">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election%2C_1912</a></p>

<p>The map is very telling, almost the opposite of the 2012 map. Roosevelt throwing the wrench in Taft&#39;s campaign because he did not understand the difference between good/bad trusts. Wilson and Teddy had almost the same platform with different names, Wilson <strong>New Nationalism</strong>, and Teddy, <strong>New Freedom</strong> were both ways to expand the federal government except Wilson wanted to prop up industry and Teddy wanted to selectively choose good and bad trusts to break open with the recently <a href="http://www.infoplease.com/encyclopedia/history/clayton-antitrust-act.html">strengthened Sherman Anti Trust Act.</a> Through the addition of the Clayton Anti Trust. </p>

<p>To be honest Taft would have been the best out of any of them. He was in the courts for his entire career before being president he knows the limits of the government and would not have seen the Federal Reserve as constitutional IMO. </p>

<p>Also Eugene V Debs a socialist candidate received 6% of the popular vote. A huge amount. Later in 1920 he got nearly two million votes from prison. Wilson jailed him under the espionage act and he died in jail in around 1924(?) I think.</p>

<p>1912 was when the empire went into full swing. Europe at war, and European men out of the fields, enriched American farmers. And you know of Bernays insane idea concerning the introduction of consumer culture to replace productive. This flux in agricultural prices put small farmers intent on independence out of business to mono-crop farming. Farms grew as technology allowed less people to cultivate more land. More food means lower prices which means harder for farmers to make a living. This is one of the main things same time that pushed the Americans to the cities. This trend was helped by the trend that while life became harder on farms life became easier in the city through the labor movement. With a the advent of unions who increased wage, fought for weekends, workman&#39;s compensation and other invaluable workers rights life as a factory worker became somewhat tolerable. </p>

<p>Wilson was a tool. An Ivory Tower fool. He, like many in power of the time, wished to make people better by making them more like himself. It was sheer shock when Wilson won. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m with you on all of this.  I don&#39;t know much about Eugene V. Debs but I&#39;m reading about him now.  Within minutes I&#39;m finding quotes of his that are incredibly poignant even today, such as:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I am not a Labor Leader; I do not want you to follow me or anyone else; if you are looking for a Moses to lead you out of this capitalist wilderness, you will stay right where you are. I would not lead you into the promised land if I could, because if I led you in, some one else would lead you out. You must use your heads as well as your hands, and get yourself out of your present condition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or how about:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your Honor, years ago I recognized my kinship with all living beings, and I made up my mind that I was not one bit better than the meanest on earth. I said then, and I say now, that while there is a lower class, I am in it, and while there is a criminal element, I am of it, and while there is a soul in prison, I am not free.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then I&#39;m reading about his farce of a trial, how he was called a traitor by the <em>actual traitor</em> Woodrow Wilson, how he conducted his defense with reason and kindness and no fear.  Wow.  Per our conversation in the other thread about Huey Long, I think it&#39;s safe to say we can add Eugene V. Debs to the list.</p>

<p>If I were the type of person who cried a lot,  I think reading the transcript of the speech he gave at his trial would have me in tears right now.  Fuck.  Knowing little else about the 1912 election, I would think that keeping this man out of office was probably critical to those trying to rule from the shadows.  Makes perfect sense why he was arrested afterwards - to remove any chance he had in the following election.</p>

<p>Edit:  Here is a transcript of the speech he gave to the court.  It&#39;s pretty incredible (ignore the source...)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great idea.  That would tell me &quot;exactly&quot; how we managed to fly 237,000 both ways x 8 manned missions = 3.8 million miles in space without fatality and only during Nixon&#39;s presidency and never to be replicated again in 40+ years by any county despite the fact that the required technology is from the 60&#39;s and there is no need to put any more money in R&amp;D since &quot;we already perfected everything&quot;</p>

<p>It will also tell me how we can see 13 billion light years from earth with a telescope which is 1.3 x 10<sup>23</sup> kilometers, but we can&#39;t see the American flag which is 400,000 kilometers away no matter what instrument we use.  (btw, don&#39;t bother posting pixellated smudges that NASA says is the flag).</p>

<p>Our current maximum ability is to fly a man 200 miles above earth, no further due to radiation which we have no means of protecting a human from.  We evidently had that technology 40 years ago.</p>

<p>The ISS travels that distance every week - some people have been on board for many months at a time. 130+ Shuttle launches were successful with only 2 missions which had fatalities, and the manned Soyuz is even more impressive - Apollo is not particularly weird here. The Apollo program also had several problems on the ground &amp; Apollo 13 very nearly ended in tragedy, so it wasn&#39;t exactly a flawless record. (It should be noted also that travelling in space is not as dangerous as trying to get there - launch is when you get the real nasty stuff. Even landing on the Moon is peanuts in comparison, in terms of mechanical stresses.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>there is no need to put any more money in R&amp;D </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who even says this. There&#39;s a reason why the ISS and Orion and the SLS are things that are happening. Not to mention the commercial crew program. Not everything&#39;s been solved yet.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The objects we see from 13 billion ly are either <em>very</em> huge or <em>very</em> bright. The flag on the moon is neither of these. There are inherent limitations to photography, which is why you can discover planets around other stars, but finding objects beyond Pluto in our solar system - ones we know to exist - is nearly impossible. You can do the optics calculations yourself, to see what kind of camera you would need to resolve tiny objects that are a long way away. It&#39;s not pretty. </p>

<p>The Van Allen belts are <em>belts</em> and we know their shape. It is relatively trivial to avoid the densest part of them, and if you&#39;re going at any sort of appreciable speed you won&#39;t spend much time within those. The Apollo missions registered exposure between 1.6 and 11.4 mGy, which is pretty low - way lower than what radiation workers&#39; maximum dose is and comparable perhaps to several X-Rays.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Going around in a circle is not the same as going away from Earth. Quit being so dense.  We went 237,000 above Earth 8 times in a row back then.  Now 200 miles.  Yeah, right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s the difference between travelling that distance outward or around the earth? The spacecraft is travelling through essentially frictionless space, it&#39;s not meaningfully different in terms of how physics works. </p>

<p>Orion is due to return people to deep space on the SLS, but with the focus on ISS and other near-Earth manned activities there hasn&#39;t been a launcher/craft combination designed for it in a while. That&#39;s not a conspiracy, that&#39;s just different priorities. As an ardent fan of Mars colonization, I&#39;m no happier about it than you are, I&#39;m sure. Unfortunately money talks, and there&#39;s more money in near-Earth activities since everyone lives here.</p>

<p>Plenty of unmanned missions have travelled way beyond what the Lunar landings ever did, so it&#39;s clearly possible. Not sure what your hangup is with that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seriously equate unmanned deep space probes as no more technically demanding than manned missions?  </p>

<p>There is a huge huge difference.  Why else wouldn&#39;t we do it?  Too boring?  The space shuttle ran into problems with the astronauts seeing retinal flashes from gamma radiation at 400 miles and they never went back.  But you are saying, 400 miles/237,000 miles, same thing?  </p>

<p>You are being purposefully deceitful not to see that</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Retinal flashes occur on board the ISS too, high intensity cosmic rays are strong enough to easily reach them. Cislunar space has a higher dose of radiation, but not massively so - unmanned probes can easily measure such things and have done so en route to Mars and the Moon on multiple occasions. Although long term exposure without protection is bound to be harmful, none of the Apollo missions were particularly lengthy. </p>

<p>The reasons for not going beyond LEO are related to cost/benefit rather than to technical shortcomings - if we really wanted to, building a water-insulated capsule isn&#39;t beyond engineering capabilities. Water is a very effective means of stopping radiation from all but the strongest cosmic ray sources, and it&#39;s fairly easy to get. If the funding was there, a manned Mars mission would be perfectly possible with present-day technology.</p>

<p>The fact that the political voices in charge of budgetary concerns have no interest in pursuing space - at least until some competitor gets on the same level - is too bad, but not really something conspiratorial.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d be interested in knowing who planned and financed 9-11. I&#39;ve come to believe it was too complex an operation for Bin Laden and a bunch of Arabs to carry out on their own. I believe it was probably financed, planned and executed by Israel&#39;s Mossad. They would have the intelligence necessary to successfully carry the operation out. Israel stood to gain because it dragged the US into a bunch of needless, petty wars and occupations in the Middle East, which didn&#39;t benefit the US at all, but forwarded Israel&#39;s plan to dominate the region. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My thoughts exactly. Given the small number of operators in Israel&#39;s tier 1 unit whose specialty was assaulting hijacked aircraft, the chance of a former operator being on one of the planes is just too high to chalk it up to coincidence..
There is definitely more Israeli involvement in 9/11 than would ever be admitted by the loyal Israeli puppets in the USG.</p>
