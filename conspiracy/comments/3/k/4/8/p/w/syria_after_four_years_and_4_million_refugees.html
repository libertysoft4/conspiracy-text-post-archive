Poor Germany has already taken 800,000, nobody asked. The Arab countries aka their neighbouring countries aren&#39;t doing nothing. Nobody wants them, the EU is causing all this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with your comment, however some and I emphasise some Arab countries are taking them in, but Europe is receiving a vast influx of immigrants that has not happened since ww2 and it is only going to put an even larger strain on society.</p>

<p>Especially here in the UK, most of us are not happy with the way our country is being lead and with an even larger number of immigrants arriving could be a catalyst for a civil war, but knowing us were to polite to do anything other than bitch about the situation online.
The Egyptians used the Internet to revolt and we use it as a tool to say we&#39;re not happy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe Germany has only set aside money in the budget for 800k - they have not actually taken them in at this point. 
Also, just to be clear, that number refers to people taken in for processing, after which they are supposed to be allocated to other countries. Germany has in fact only pledged to allow 30k to stay permanently over the next 2 years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing about Germany taking 800,000 is, they&#39;re not really taking 800,000 - once granted citizenship, which they will get, they are free to travel all over the EU, and probably a lot of non-EU countries quite easily and legally.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is my best guess. The fascists are ready to clamp down upon the West and they require a catalyzing event to plausibly swoop in. That way, instead of rebelling, the populace will be divided. Some will say the peace is being kept, some will say it&#39;s necessary, and some will say it&#39;s a power move. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, the elites move right on ahead with their original plans. It&#39;s an old trick. If you study history, you see it everywhere. </p>
