    <div class="md"><p>Jews don&#39;t control everything. There are some people that publicly present themselves as jewish but there are many other races and religions involved. Now that&#39;s assuming they actually believe that. I&#39;m inclined to think they are more into occultism than Judaism or Christianity.Their race or religion has nothing to do with the crimes they commit and bringing it up constantly accomplishes nothing aside from making your position unappealing to most. Also, limiting yourself to Jews will cause you to miss out on a lot of other stuff that doesn&#39;t involve Jews....bad people are bad people regardless of race. The stuff you post is simple minded conspiracy fluff for people that like to pretend it&#39;s all the Jews. I&#39;m not denying many Jews are in positions of power and are involved. I&#39;m saying I doubt they&#39;re really Jewish AND they aren&#39;t the only group of people running the show.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are part of the picture undoubtedly... It&#39;s just unnecessary to constantly throw Zionist-Jew in every title. It&#39;s not all Zionist jews running The show and it doesn&#39;t make anything they do better or worse so it&#39;s pointless to constantly put it there.</p>

<p>The bigger issue I have is the black v white narrative you contribute to. You act like black people standing up against police brutality are denying that white people are also abused... They stand up for their community specifically but that doesn&#39;t mean they stand against white people. There some naive people who I would consider the mirror image of yourself who do think all whites are bad, the vast majority doesn&#39;t. They aren&#39;t saying &quot;only black lives matter&quot; they are saying &quot;black lives matter too.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>No they are saying &quot;BlackLivesMatter&quot;</strong>, and BOOING and actually complaining if anyone utters ALL LIVES MATTER, White Lives Matter, or Cop Lives Matter. There is a HUGE difference.</p>

<p>What array of corporate entities is actually funding, actively producing, and pushing that false narrative into the public?  Who specifically owns and controls them?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never tried to dispute those claims. I&#39;m saying Zionists are a part of a larger picture. There are more people and groups involved. Also, focusing on their religion is pointless as it comes off as racist and drives people away. This group of people does bad things, that&#39;s it.... No need for race to be involved especially when There are clearly other races and religions involved.</p>
