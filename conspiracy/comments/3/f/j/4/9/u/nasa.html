    <div class="md"><p>I think humans have colonized much of the solar system. Civilization on Earth has, I think, risen and fallen multiple times, over hundreds of thousands of years, each time crashing back to near Stone Age level. </p>

<p><em>Think about what you, yourself, would know how to do if civilization broke down and all these technologies just stopped working. Maybe I could build a generator, maybe.. if I had some wire... But I don&#39;t know even how to mine for copper, let along smelt it. To paraphrase Joe Rogan, you could leave me in the forest for 1000 years and I&#39;d never figure out how to build an iPhone.</em></p>

<p>But a small group is able to keep and occult the knowledge and technology each time. While the rest of us are rebuilding from Stone Age, they&#39;re zipping about in anti-grav saucers.</p>

<p>I think that&#39;s the big secret. And as we find older and older archeological sites, the picture becomes more and more clear: Humans have been around for a <strong>very</strong> long time, and somebody doesn&#39;t want us to know about it. There is a reason for that.</p>

<p>Bro, that really isn&#39;t true. Both NASA and other, independent scientists, have announced several times over the past few decades that they think they have found evidence of alien life. The problem hasn&#39;t been that they haven&#39;t released the information, but rather that nobody seems to pay any attention to it.</p>

<p>Here are a couple of such stories just off the top of my head:-</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You really are obtuse, aren&#39;t you? The ISS exists, and there are many independent photographs of it. Funny how every time that is brought up - including information on how to see it for yourself - you very quickly run away from the conversation, never to return. Are you really that terrified to find out that you may be wrong?</p>

<p>Tell me, have you ever heard of Occam&#39;s Razor? It&#39;s a lot easier to believe that the space program exists than there is some sort of global conspiracy by thousands of people and dozens of countries that has been maintained in near-perfect secrecy for the last 60 years...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Occam&#39;s razor would dictate that in fact, ISS doesn&#39;t exist. The assumptions you are making about the people who rule over us are all good, just, truthful and benevolent has been proved wrong time and time again. Think about before Galileo proved the world was round. Most people thought it was flat. That didn&#39;t make it true. Don&#39;t you know that the same logic applies here. Just because most people believe something, it doesnt have to be true. Most people simply parrot lies that they hear from media and authority figures anyway. Is that too hard for you to understand?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You really are obtuse, aren&#39;t you? The ISS exists, and there are many independent photographs of it. Funny how every time that is brought up - including information on how to see it for yourself - you very quickly run away from the conversation, never to return. Are you really that terrified to find out that you may be wrong?</p>
