<p>That link is a huge boon of an inspiration to me and has led me to accessing my own subconscious, and seeing some shit most wouldn&#39;t even believe is real.</p>

<p>Learn stuff like how to play chess, how to grow grapes, make wine, make cheese, build from wood, cob house building books and classes, survivalist courses, save some money to buy some raw land in the country and camp out there to spend time disconnecting from the bullshit.</p>

<p>Study the differences in psychology of different cultures:</p>

<p>Learn about the 130+ cognitive biases the brain filters reality which gives it a skewed picture of the whole picture:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases</a></p>

<p>Learn tai chi, kriya yoga, exercise, free biking, soup kitchen, dumpster diving and reselling what you find (made a $100 today off that), find something you enjoy and master it.</p>

<p>This book here goes into details of the psychology of mastering something:</p>

<p>Everyone understands each of these things differently. There won&#39;t be a universal approach to these. Therefore abstract talking like &#39;&#39;be the better you&#39;&#39; won&#39;t bring anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its deeper than that. For example as far as what comes after this life, there either are ramifications or nothing at all. Now personally after accessing my own subconscious, i remember that indeed i existed before i was born, and there is no way i ever want to come back to this shit hole again, I&#39;m done, seen it, done, figured it out, and it is indeed a massive prison we live in and the body is the prison cell.</p>

<p>And according to many eastern traditions, enlightenment is freedom from ever coming back here again and the ultimate truth. So even if there are different traditions that view enlightenment differently, at least they are agreeing that there is enlightenment, and in my perspective, its the loftiest of goals possible on this rock. Would could you really say is higher than enlightenment?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stopping 4eading all the shit you can&#39;t change anyway would be a good start. Instead read books. Stories, not documentaries. Go out in the sun. There is nothing you can do, besides doing what makes you happy. Watching news is worthless anyway, as it does not help you anything.</p>

<p>The change needs to be change of your daily life. That will change you. Just stop feeding yourself all this shit. In two weeks you&#39;ll notice the first effects.</p>

<p>Leave the computer. Stop being a victim of negative habits simply by not doing them in the first place. If you wanna be really serious, bite your thumb really hard every tkme you do what you shouldn&#39;t and tell yourself &quot;NO!&quot;. You&#39;ll stop. Pavlov says Hi.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is not an incorrect reaction. My understanding is that if people have a strong belief, and you try to prove them wrong with facts, their reaction is most often: to belief even more strongly.</p>

<p>Action has most impact within our sphere of influence. Our sphere of influence starts within ourselves, extends to our family and friends, and then our neighbours and community, and from there into the wider world. A young first worlder trying to fly to the third world to solve problems of world hunger or world war is unlikely to be successful, and may find for example that all money, goods and services are co-opted by local government, wealthy or warlords, and very little makes it to the people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well if you knew the bible you&#39;d understand why we as christians think the way we do. Because mankind chose sin, everything is messed up, that&#39;s why jesus came to earth and died for us, so that we could be saved from this wicked world. In revealations it does describe a terribly painful time for the wicked who will remain on the earth, after the whole one world order is setup. </p>

<p>Life is short for the good people and the evil people, the good people understand that life here is temporary and know that doing good for others. Being an upstanding person, will  lead to riches in heaven. The wicked will be snuffed out. I&#39;m getting ahead of myself though since you don&#39;t believe.. continuing.</p>

<p>Mark 8:36 
What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul?</p>

<p>The bible predicts the whole one world order scheme. The same &quot;synagogue of satan&quot; that killed jesus is still on the earth seeking to enslave and hurt everyone. Read revelations sometime. Give that bible a read through that all those fire and brimestone preachers of old talked about. Its all about Jesus and his sacrifice for Us.</p>

<p>You have to understand there IS a spiritual aspect to what is going on. There&#39;s good and evil. There is a Devil that exists. </p>

<p>I personally have found way more satisfaction in being a good loving Christ like person (which is why the word christian is used, little christ like one). Ever wonder why rich and famous people still kill themselves? Because the pursuit of wealth and power, fame, doesn&#39;t satisfy. Sure, you need some money and for sure a social life, but beyond that there isn&#39;t much to be gained if you sacrifice your integrity. </p>

<p>&quot;I wish everyone could be famous and rich so they could find out that its not the answer&quot; -Jim Carrey</p>

<p>I just wish these evil d bags would realize that if they dropped the bs and gave their lives for good instead of evil, they would have a more satisfying existence, something to be proud of. When they&#39;re on their death bed they&#39;ll realize they wasted their lives, and harmed others in the process. I even feel sorry for some of them, they don&#39;t realize how wasteful their lives are, all that human potential used for evil. Such a waste.</p>

Then he will speak to them in his wrath, and terrify them in his fury, saying</strong>... Psalm 2:1-12 </p>

<p>Revelation 21:4 ESV / 35 helpful votes</p>

<p><strong>He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away</strong>.”</p>

<p>If you&#39;d like to talk more feel free to pm me. There&#39;s so much more I&#39;d like to talk about when it comes to the bible. I just wish more people would pick it up and give it an honest unbiased read through.</p>

<p>God Bless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have read revelations. I think it&#39;s bullshit, but it was an entertaining story. </p>

<p>I went to church for 18 years every sunday because my parents forced me to. I know a lot more about Christianity than your average joe. Sorry, that stuff just doesn&#39;t click with me. The church trained my parents to hate me because of my sexual orientation, and outwardly rejected me when I started questioning the ideas of the church. It&#39;s a social club, and nothing more. </p>

<p>Jesus was a wise guy, but so was Buddha. There&#39;s been plenty of wise people over the years, and there&#39;s absolutely no reason to focus exclusively on one person or one book. If you believe in God, then you believe God made the whole universe, so the entire universe is God&#39;s word, not just the King James translated version of a 2000 year old book. So take multiple samples instead of being socially pressured in to believing Jesus has exclusivity rights about understanding the universe. </p>

<p>I know you&#39;re trying to do well, I&#39;m sure you believe all this stuff, but I don&#39;t because I&#39;ve learned better. You said your piece, now I&#39;ve said mine. </p>

<p>Have a good one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can I give one more response now that I know where your coming from? </p>

<p>With consideration and respect to your beliefs and experiences. I hate to come off as pushy, as its difficult with text messaging to give an accurate basis of my tone and typing a long response can seem hasty and give of a commandeering tone.</p>

<p>First off. I&#39;d like to apologize if you&#39;ve had negative experiences from the church or from christians. Christians are called to love others. As jesus commands. If we dont have love, we don&#39;t have the &quot;fruit of the spirit&quot; which should come naturally when we are understanding of how much Jesus sacrificed for us. </p>

<p>I too was forced to go to church as a kid! I hated going, it was all these rules and boring stories lol. So I know were your coming from. And I&#39;ve been at odds with other christians. There are &quot;denominations&quot; that believe in false things which aren&#39;t accurate with scripture. Just like that pastor who asked his congregation for millions of dollars for a private jet... there are other pastors who have actually taught the most horrendous things. They get away with it because the people that give them a platform dont know their bible, where it says.. 
Romans 16:17-18 
I appeal to you, brothers, to watch out for those who cause divisions and create obstacles contrary to the doctrine that you have been taught; avoid them. For such persons do not serve our Lord Christ, but their own appetites, and by smooth talk and flattery they deceive the hearts of the naive.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry that your parents feel that way.. that&#39;s terrible and I can understand why my msg could cause you discomfort and why the idea of the bible would seem foolish. If your parents have that belief about your sexual identity then they would have to hate themselves too for committing the sin of hatred, which Jesus described as murder. </p>

<p>1 John 3:15 
New International Version
&quot;Anyone who hates a brother or sister is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life residing in him.&quot;</p>

<p>Some christians unfortunately hate towards others, but they dont see their own sins. I have sinned just as much as a homosexual, a murderer, a prostitute, name the sin, according to the bible. I have nothing to brag about. God just wants us to realize that we need Jesus, that theres more to life then meets the eye, that despite our brokeness and the broken world, He gave us all a gift in Jesus. </p>

<p>I know a lot of this must sound cheesy or contrived lol. I used to laugh at people that talked like this but now that I&#39;ve gone through my struggles and found out that God loved me, did I start to read the bible with joy.</p>

<p>I guess the thing i&#39;d leave you with is that God loves you. Dont beleive the fire and brimestone denomination. They break the law themselves. The law was created to show that we couldn&#39;t save ourselves, that God&#39;s perfection was to great for us to reach, that we all have sinned against him and needed a savior.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#39;m not trying to intrude, im not a pastor or missionary. I came back to the bible after having a struggle with internet pornography, and learned that god loved me all along and that he has given me freedom through his son, if I just believe and read his word/bible. </p>

<p>You have a good day too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for writing that, I appreciate your empathy more than anything. I&#39;ve never hated the teachings of Christ, just the people who misunderstand them, which is almost everyone. I got nothing against Christians, but more against people who cling to dogma as a sense of self-identity and don&#39;t self-investigate the world in which they live. Do you know what I mean? </p>

<p>Thanks again for such a heartfelt message, I do appreciate it. But we can say all these lovely things using modern language, there&#39;s really no reason to invoke an 1800 year old book every 5 lines. :)</p>

<p>Peace.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It saddens me how many misunderstand the teachings of christ or don&#39;t acknowledge them. Do me a favor, whenever you come upon someone with those misunderstandings just tell them the bible verse about loving your neighbor. Thats why I bring up those &quot;1800 year old book verses&quot; to not only maybe help those who aren&#39;t christians if they ask, but also to correct the christians who have a misunderstanding. But christians like me need help with getting that out there. To help break down that negative dogma.</p>

<p>Regards</p>

<p>We&#39;re doomed.  And the judgment of some higher power on that will be: they didn&#39;t even struggle. They went to the boxcars with their suitcases and they didn&#39;t even struggle.

increasingly more and more sophisticated in their in their subliminal mechanisms of control.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t mean anything grandiose and paranoid.  I just mean through press releases and sound bites and the forced idiocy of television, the <em>drama of a dying world has been turned into a soap opera for most people</em>.  And they don&#39;t understand that it&#39;s <em>their</em> story and that they will <em>eat it in the final act</em> if somewhere between here and the final act, they don&#39;t stand up on their hind legs and howl!  And it&#39;s not done through organizing or vanguard parties or cadres of intellectual elites.  It&#39;s done through just walking away from all that: Claiming your identity.  Claiming your vision, your being, your intuition, and then <em>acting from that without regret</em>.  Cleanly, without regret.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the omega point, according to Terence McKenna, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-tY6hmKcms">&quot;Culture is not your friend&quot;</a>.  To him, the &#39;aggressive dominant psychopaths&#39; are the &#39;least among us&#39; in a <em>&#39;solar, paternal authoritarian, dominator culture&#39;</em> whose main contribution to the world was the <em>hierarchy</em>, which is at odds to individualism.  But worse than that, that we have all the knowledge, technology, resources, the drive for every human to be living in paradise and yet we do not because the least empathetic of these dominators are more into the game of dominating than they are coordinating and facilitating.  Groups lack empathy and diminish the import of the individual until there is nothing.</p>

<p>Dominators use a cold, calculating human instrumentality of science and of crowds and of economies to push this kind of human ascention aspiration (conquer, of nations, of space, of worlds); rather than trying to find our most optimal and sustainable niche and role in nature such that these ascentions can happen within the immediate experience of mind, rather than of material.</p>

<p>TLDR: Basically our world has been taken over by materialists instead of spiritualists.</p>

<p>And, according to Mckenna, the answer is for everyone to do mushrooms, to become the psychedelic technoshamanic monks he believes we have historically gravitated towards being (as mystery school initiates, shaman, kabbalists, occultists, alchemists) prior to the prohibition by the ecclesiastical institutions.</p>

<p> You ever watch CNN for longer than, say, 20 hours in one day? I gotta cut that out. Watch CNN.

<p>Yea, shits fucked up. IMO &quot;they&quot; want you to feel like you stated to paralyze you from actually doing anything. There&#39;s just as much good out there as there is bad. All you can do is focus on what you can do to better your small slice of the world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly! I spent the last year looking for a job, finally got one that is neuroscience research for a piddly $35k a year (after the original offer said $60k, which was a flat-out lie), and then a month and a half later was fired once I got the labs experiments running! I had to learn 3 programming languages to make it happen... Then they just cut me off after I made everything work and wrote documentation about it. I feel so used! I don&#39;t know how people are supposed to live a normal life and buy a house and stuff anymore, I just literally don&#39;t get it. I guess that&#39;s probably the reason most people choose to remain ignorant, and I&#39;m starting to wonder if they&#39;re actually smarter than me by doing so, which is something I&#39;ve never really seriously considered. But I don&#39;t know how being ignorant would help me make enough money to live. None of this makes any sense to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, it was pretty stressful too because the way my boss got rid of me was by overhearing a conversation I had with a co-worker about the EU&#39;s financial problems. My boss reported me to HR for &quot;creating a hostile work environment with my political statements&quot; when I did no such thing, and I got put on administrative leave and escorted out of the building by security. They&#39;re doing an investigation, but it&#39;s likely they&#39;ll side with my boss (despite her having already done this to another employee she randomly decided she didn&#39;t like anymore) since she is the one applying for grants and getting grant money, which the research hospital gets a 60% cut of. My co-worker and his wife moved from Brazil for this job, he just put in his 2-weeks notice after I was fired because the work environment is so toxic, and they&#39;re going to have to move back to Brazil as a result. Also, his wife just got pregnant. The whole thing is fucking crazy, I feel like I&#39;m on some reality show where the curtains will go up at any moment and everyone will go &quot;Surprise!&quot; like it&#39;s some reality show or something. I just can&#39;t believe everything is <em>actually</em> this screwed up. Sorry, just had to get that off my chest. Thanks for being supportive. </p>

<p>Everything happens for a reason. There is plenty of freelance work in the programming industry. I&#39;d find some land in the countryside, become a freelancer (be your own boss), start growing your own food, hunt and/or fish, pay as little as you can into the system (shop local). If you drink alcohol, you can either brew beer or make your own wine. If you smoke tobacco, I&#39;d suggest rolling your own (You&#39;ll save a shit tonne of money). A carton for me is 10$, where as if you bought a carton of marlboros or something, it&#39;ll be 50$+ depending on where you are. I&#39;ve done most of this, still working on a few things though.

<p>Maybe more awareness discourages many people from taking difficult but necessary action required to overcome obstacles. OTOH, the less aware people who are full of optimism, are able to forge ahead heedless of roadblocks as they accomplish goals that skeptics gave up in despair.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We were doing real-time fMRI scanning, it was very cool. </p>

<p>The problem is I was in a medical research center. I have a bachelors in EE. Almost everyone I work with has a phd or more. I am chump change to them, and it&#39;s a very academia-style environment where the social hierarchy is extremely important. Some PIs (Principle Investigators) are cool, I worked with one for 5 years that was absolutely wonderful and treated me like a fellow human being, but this one I just recently worked for was a nightmare and she was all about the power games and office politics, which also really negatively impacts the science because I wasn&#39;t allowed to question her methods or experiment design. I basically tried to get a career in an academia research field without actually being in academia, so it worked out kind of weird. But I definitely have a masters-level understanding of research neuroscience, which might be useful in applying to jobs later.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never worked for a corporation doing this, the environment would likely be completely different. It&#39;s really hard to find something though. Right now in one of the largest 5 cities in the US, I see only 2 job openings that are even remotely like what I&#39;ve done. One for developing the algorithms to detect heart attacks for heart monitors, and another for something about programming robotic prosthetic limbs. So it&#39;s kind of limiting in a way. </p>

<p>What I would do, is get in to machine intelligence. Do a computer science major with a specialization in AI. We were doing all computational neuroscience. If you&#39;re more in to the biological side of behavioral neuroscience instead of the psychophysical behavioral stuff (behaviors you can just measure with a machine), there seems to be a lot of opportunities there, but you have to be cool with cutting off the heads of hundreds of mice and dissecting their brains over and over. Which I am not. Which is why I work with computers. </p>

<p>I think if you really want to figure out the way people are, you should go in to psychology, but you have to get at least a masters before you can do clinical stuff in most cases.</p>

<p>Hope that helps</p>

<p>Anyways on the subject of a job. I really have no fucking clue besides maybe getting into the weed industry? I live in cali and know of people who make a lot growing weed and selling it to dispensary. Other than that, I used to be in the Coast Guard but realized that is a big waste of time/money for tax payers and we did not do shit. Here I am 30 years old delivering pizza and no using my GI bill because I cant think of a new career that is not bullshit or helps perpetuates this disgusting socioeconomic system. I also considered teaching Yoga at a park or something as I am into fitness. I donno man, cheers to you bro I owe you a beer. </p>

<p>The thing is, though, they don&#39;t <em>want</em> to understand. This is what really kills me the most. I&#39;ve always wanted to understand the world <em>so bad</em> and now that I kinda finally get it, when I speak to others they DO NOT WANT TO HEAR IT. Maybe it&#39;s from growing up in places like Oklahoma where people drink the coolaid so much they don&#39;t even know which way is up anymore, that has given me a sense of defeat that others might not have. </p>

<p>You&#39;re right though, I think your post is the most correct out of all the comments on this post. It only takes a small number of people to inform others, and then it can grow exponentially. </p>

<p>I read this scientific paper about enacting change, and they found when a public&#39;s perception of the idea was changing the fastest, was the same time when the groups and people trying to spread the word finally start giving up. Because the change is so gradual, they have the impression that nothing is happening and that their efforts are futile, while in reality it&#39;s blossoming in popularity. It&#39;s just hard to see from the perspective of one person. Can you imagine how it must feel though to have fought in the 80s for gay rights, only to have it legal and widely accepted now? Must be so vindicating, but I imagine in those decades there are plenty of weeks where it feels like nothing is happening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those who belong to this small class have tasted how sweet and blessed a possession philosophy is, and have also seen enough of the madness of the multitude; and they know that no politician is honest, nor is there any champion of justice at whose side they may fight and be saved. Such an one may be compared to a man who has fallen among wild beasts --he will not join in the wickedness of his fellows, but neither is he able singly to resist all their fierce natures, and therefore seeing that he would be of no use to the State or to his friends, and reflecting that he would have to throw away his life without doing any good either to himself or others, he holds his peace, and goes his own way. He is like one who, in the storm of dust and sleet which the driving wind hurries along, retires under the shelter of a wall; and seeing the rest of mankind full of wickedness, he is content, if only he can live his own life and be pure from evil or unrighteousness, and depart in peace and good-will, with bright hopes.

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, these kinds of meta threads are one of the most valuable things about <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> for me :)</p>

<p>I&#39;ve consoled myself about the state of things in many ways, but recently it&#39;s these realizations that give me strength:</p>

<ul>
<li>We already have the technology and then some to create such unequivocal chaos in society that the whole system would grind to a halt. One should remain aware that the actual reason there isn&#39;t yet rebellion on this scale isn&#39;t just our collective Stockholm syndrome, it&#39;s that it&#39;s not actually yet that bad, and if you put your thinking cap on, you realize that your options for personal happiness are mostly still everywhere without need to gas the subways.</li>
<li>TPTB don&#39;t actually have any technology phenomenally more advanced that what we do (IMO).</li>
<li>If you just avoid reading <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and related news and blogs etc. for a while and replace it with Good Fiction, the world starts to take on a distinctly warmer hue.</li>
<li>One is only going to be on this planet a short while, regardless of your spiritual predilections. Taking measures to not fear death (maybe take Ayahuasca or something?) does a lot to make things more tolerable.</li>
<li>It&#39;s important to do naughty things in life lest you someday forget how. Try not to hurt or greatly inconvenience people in the process (a little is fine; you be the judge)</li>
<li>I thought of it last night that society is like a big elephant. As individuals, we&#39;re like the birds that hang around on its back. We carry along with it wherever it goes, but should it decide to lumber off a cliff, we&#39;re free to fly away. Just don&#39;t go to sleep on it, y&#39;know?</li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>I see what you&#39;re getting at. Reminds me of the book &quot;Extropy&quot; by Jeremy Rifkin. He talked about the fundamental &quot;battle&quot; in the universe being Extropy vs Entropy, order and organization vs disorder and crumbling instability. We humans are some of the most extropic objects in the universe, and we play a role in developing the extropy of our collective social global consciousness that&#39;s developing. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The world might be burning but I am enjoying this experience.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s fun to watch, but I&#39;ve been burned a few times recently and I realized it&#39;s not quite as fun as it used to be. The world is burning, and we&#39;re on it. This is the part I have trouble coming to emotional terms with. I have trouble just stepping back and laughing, because the swarm of bullshit beliefs that has taken over human consciousness like a cancer is affecting my life directly, quite often. </p>

<p>The fire is enjoyable until you get burned. Maybe I just need to step back from the fire... but I don&#39;t know where that would be</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I deeply feel your pain, friend. </p>

<p>All I can tell you is that we are in this together and that we are not going down without a fight. I have been burned too; jobs, relationships, family, choices, missed chances, lies, etc. </p>

<p>You have to come grips with &quot;letting go&quot;.</p>

<p>This is the highest and most difficult challenge of the human experience. We always wanna grab on and hold on forever.</p>

<p>Life is only temporary; we don&#39;t know whats next.
There&#39;s plenty of evidence and knowledge out there to prove that there&#39;s something else out there, but you have to discover it yourself.</p>

<p>No one can tell you what your reality is but you,
on the flips side; do you wanna live in a utopia or a dystopia? 
With other people?
Well we have to work together.. people can&#39;t just run around doing whatever makes them feel entertained all the time (which is what is happening today). </p>

<p>We have to sacrifice. We have to suffer. We are cogs in this great machine we have built; HUMANITY. Now lets evolve past these petty tribulations. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I pretty much agree. As Terrence McKenna said &quot;As far as humanity is concerned, the shit hit the fan so to speak when we discovered agriculture, because this created the social foundation for selfishness. This is &#39;my&#39; crops, this is &#39;my&#39; grain tower, and so on. In fact the first defensive military structure we know about in history is the Tower of Jericho from 8000 BC, which is a grain tower.&quot;</p>

<p>We are totally out of sync with our natural environment, and even with our animal environment and each other. So many people feel subjugated in this world, and they shouldn&#39;t. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s true, I remember that as well. But I also remember how that collectivist attitude was used to justify a war against Iraq, which had nothing to do with 911. I remember people too afraid to speak out about it, because of that collectivist attitude. </p>

<p>I like the neighborly community part of it very much, but I do NOT like how that ends up being warped in to nationalism and used to justify wars. If only it were easy to split the two apart. I think smaller communities are the answer, there&#39;s no real need for these giant nations and the resulting aggregation of power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just read your piece on emotion.  Great read.  You are correct to a T.   You know, I did not start my awakening until after 911.  In all that time my mind has been blown by things I have learned about the natural order of things.  I like to look at the MSM news just to see where they are steering the ship.  So much disinfo mixed with real, its exhausting.  I agree with you completely when you say to take a break from the negative news.  I think in the negative, people get addicted just like Facebook, where as in the positive, there is an uncomfortable feeling that things should not be so comfortable.  Does that shit make any sense?

<p>&quot;I think our society is run by insane people for insane objectives. ...I think we&#39;re being run by maniacs for maniacal ends, you know. ...I think they&#39;re all insane. But I am liable to be put away as insane for expressing that, you know. That&#39;s what is insane about it. I mean, don&#39;t you agree?&quot;</p>

<p>John Lennon (Paraphrased from an interview with Peter Lewis, June 6th, 1968)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_dJNzDo8SQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_dJNzDo8SQ</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m empathic and therefor emotionally sensitive. I&#39;ve gone through multiple periods where within my spirit I just crawled into the fetal position and wept after discovering &#39;another&#39; area of madness. The world is insane, and those who point out this fact are labeled insane by those who are asleep, in denial, or in on the plan.</p>

<p>Waking up is hard to do. It is NOT an easy process. It is confusing, disorienting, disheartening. But we all much push through it. NEVER assume you are fully awake, because in all likely hood none us ever will be with the amount of deception we live in. Keep searching for the Truth.</p>

<p>To become discouraged by the madness we live in is to be expected, in fact I would say if you don&#39;t get discouraged from time to time something is wrong. What we must not do is &#39;stay&#39; discouraged. Recognize you have a valid right to be discouraged, and then make a conscious choice not to be. Don&#39;t let the monsters rob you of your spiritual and mental well being.</p>

<p>We&#39;re in a war. A physical and spiritual war. A war for the very future of humankind and the planet. Are we going to live free or be ruled by psychopaths?</p>

<p>Time is growing short and if we&#39;re to win this war against the tyrants then we must free our minds and spirits from their control. Free your mind from the toxic garbage that is all forms of Mass Media, it is mind control. Free your spirit from all forms of Religion, for it is spirit control.</p>

<p>We were NOT created to be enslaved by anyone or anything. Reconnect with your spirit. For it is from our spirit that we find our strength, bravery, and fortitude. Reconnect with the Creator. For this is how our spirit is healed, fed, and strengthened. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The world has always felt like this. Some conspiracies (political/corpoate collusions to amass wealth, drug war) are real, but many are people grasping to exert psychological control over insane events. Some conspiracy theories are almost religious in nature. Flat earth, Illuminati, Hollow Earth, etc.</p>

<p>&quot;9/11 was such a devastating and world changing event, there&#39;s no way it could have been exacted by a dozen men with weapons no more advanced than box cutters. Something so devastating must be the result of a worldwide conspiracy of thousands, including the highest echelons of government and intelligence.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s psychologically comforting to believe that something so evil must be the construct of a network of powers beyond our control, instead of the reality: that the evil came from people who, in another set of circumstances, wouldn&#39;t be much different than you or me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah physically that&#39;s what probably what happened. But the physical evidence also points to the fact that those towers would not go down due to jet fuel and the fact that the section of the Pentagon that was destroyed held the information on the three billion missing in the defense budget brought to attention one day before 9/11.  Also building seven collapsing for no reason. This US simple stuff and my counter point to your point of it being as simple as those hijackers is that there is a higher power at work and it&#39;s us. That was not orchestrated without help and we did it to assimilate this modern reality we currently endure. The OP felt powerless and wants to give up because there is no point, well, he&#39;s right. There are powers that be running this show and we don&#39;t stand a chance.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m perfectly capable of debating or even accepting any scenario legitimately posited with a combination of evidence, scientific method, or plain ol&#39; Occam&#39;s Razor.</p>

<p>I mean, you&#39;d have to present me with some staggering evidence for the claim that every single entity with power or agency over another is inherently as corrupt as systemically possible. Off the top of my head, doctors and nurses spring to mind as exceptions. Altruism&#39;s very existence as a biological/evolutionary trait seems to argue against your point.</p>

<p>The claim itself (which I am apparently &quot;offensively&quot; dismissing) borders on the philosophical. We&#39;re generally engaged in empirical debates here.</p>

<p>I&#39;m scared that a nuke is going to instantly obliterate millions of people. Thousands of children, babies, evaporated into a instant mist of red and then turned into nothing but stains on the remaining concrete. </p>

<p>Why not, we already dropped nukes on Japan, we&#39;ve already shown that man is willing to commit total genocide for no fucking reason at all. You think these people have limits, that they wouldn&#39;t drop multiple nukes across America? Remember, they are insane and have no emotions, these people literally rape their children for fun, they are beyond fucked, and starting a holy war with nuclear rain is just a treat for them.</p>

<p>I fucking hope I&#39;m wrong. I really do. I really do. But, I just.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>The worst part is, there&#39;s nothing I can do. But I swear to god, if this actually happens, and I&#39;m not obliterated and reddit is still up post nuclear holocaust, I&#39;m coming back to tell you mother fuckers I told you so.</p>

<p>Oh, and before one of you mother fuckers tries to call me unhinged, just remember this. These are the same people that flew a fucking airplane, into a fucking building. <strong>twice.</strong> <strong>they brutally murdered thousands, in a hell fire.</strong> <em>the Israeli&#39;s were literally dancing in joy about this. They are not human, they are daemons.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I might have some words to help... I don&#39;t know if you will see this or not.  But in my opinion there are two ways of looking at things in this life.   Pessimistically or optimistically.    Sure shit has gotten incredibly fucked but it&#39;s not all that bad there is some promise in all of what is going on.    I go to school and major in environmental studies because I want to help, I don&#39;t know what I would be doing if I truly felt that the end is near and humans are on the edge of extinction.   And even if this is undeniably true I would rather stick to the team that believes and wants to help them to be the one poking holes or weighing down the ship for it to sink.    Help! And read books about it, don&#39;t be a crazy skeptic. Be informed and keep cool about the world and others we live with, we are all part of a social movement or paradigm shift even if it does seem pointless.     ;) keep ur head up bro</p>

<p>One thing you should know is that most of the abrasive racism and violent speech is posted by people who wish to discredit the site. They flood the board with these posts so that when newcomers like you visit they see these posts and are completely turned off.</p>

<p>But once you lurk for about 6 months you see this, and you learn to recognize the genuine posters amongst the hoards of shills, trolls, and shit-posters. </p>

The Buddhists say that life is suffering; and so it is for the masses; you do realize that your suffering has meaning only to yourself, and that the world is filled to overflowing with suffering; look to your left, look to your right, and you will see those who suffer far more; climb up on the rooftop and look out over the city and you will see suffering in every single house. Being alive; being human means that we suffer. Accept the suffering; never accept the slavery; never bow down, never be beaten! You are only beaten when you say you are beaten, not an instant before. Every day is a new day; quality of life is made of quality of moments; do not allow what happened yesterday to colour today; do not allow what happens today to taint tomorrow. Go forth and build a life by working and planning for a future filled with family and friends and love and quality moments; don&#39;t forget to enjoy today. This moment is only a small moment; if it&#39;s a bad moment, you have the choice to seek out good moments, and create an ocean of good moments. This is how you build a good life.</p>

<p>Never give up, never give in! Onwards and upwards,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Try to accept  how things are the best you can and then accept that you deserve your happiness too. Try to visualize yourself reclaiming your energy from all the bad things that are happening. Allow yourself a chance to take that energy and ball it back up inside you. Then, send your energy back out to better sources like your hobbies, your loved ones whom treat you well and encourage good vibes, your body which houses your special soul, etc.   cut those bad energy cords every chance you get. Some bad  cords  are easy to break, some are much tougher. Choose to love. Choose to leave bad things you cannot change where they be.

Parallel Verses
New International Version
&quot;Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest&quot;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also important to remember is that a population thats in fear is a population that&#39;s easier to control. Don&#39;t believe everything you hear. Also, because we live in the information age we hear all about the bad and never the good. For me, the good news is Jesus Christ who died for all of our sins and offers greater joy and glory in His will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>John 16:33 
&quot;I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.&quot;</p>

<p>When the apostles took swords to defend jesus from being captured by the roman guards one of them took a sword and cut off one of the guards ears. Jesus then healed the ear afterwards. </p>

<p>Only love can overcome evil. Those who live by the sword die by it. If he hadn&#39;t of healed that soldiers ear that apostle probably would have been killed with Jesus. </p>

<p>War after war, when will it end? Only when love overcomes. Those in power want you to take up arms and cause a war, so they have an excuse to kill you. But being filled with joy and love, confuses them and breaks them down. Just like that church that was attacked, even though it was a horrific murder, they turned it into a positive, they showed love and grace to the accused, and that message of love spread. Only that can change the world.
 Satan, wants everyone to be in fear of him, everyone to hate each other, and steal, kill and destroy each other, by using his lies and deceit. </p>

<p>Once the roman empire was overcome by christians who loved despite being imprisoned and killed, was their victory for the people. They created an economic system where they gave to each other as needed in the early church, they banded together by love, and the populace found it so intriguing that the majority then started to be for the Christians and the roman empire got changed. </p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t matter whether we live in a democracy or communisim. Just like the enslaved israelites of old who were slaves to the egyptians &quot;government&quot;, when the populace bands together in one common goal, by the power of God, they will have victory. Whenever the israelites gave into sinful pleasures of the evil people they came upon, did God punish them. The problem in america is everyone has their own little tribe, no one is loving their neighbor, selfishness is commonplace, even some that claim to be christian, which I apologize for. </p>

<p>The only way to be a changed person is to realize how much a man named Jesus did for you and I by dying on a tree, by first being tortured in a most terrible manner, then crucified on a tree, which was the worst form of punishment there was in the roman empire. But he went through it all to save us, for we need a savior.</p>

<p>Isaiah 52:14
&quot;Just as there were many who were appalled at him -- his appearance was so disfigured beyond that of any human being and his form marred beyond human likeness--&quot;</p>

<p>The torah/old testament actually predicts jesus&#39;s death, in detail with this verse in Isaiah. Any historian worth his salt agree&#39;s with the historical evidence for Jesus, the argument is, is he who he said he was? The government, the evil secret society and Pharisees of Jesus time, killed him, and they played right into Gods plan to redeem mankind, that whoever believes in Him shall be saved. </p>

<p>John 3:18 
&quot;Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God&#39;s one and only Son&quot;.</p>

<p>To say that Christianity is trained population control is intellectual laziness if I may be honest. Be careful with getting all your wisdom from just conspiracies, for the conspiracies lead to more conspiracies. But the Truth will Set you Free my friend. Speaking from experience. Even though I&#39;ve been laughed at and poked at, I continue to share the word of God, because its become so evident to me now, and have seen others set free by it.</p>

<p>I just want people to give Jesus a chance to work in their life, to give the bible a true intellectually (and spiritually) honest chance. Have you read the bible? It holds up everytime I read it now, and I&#39;m not dumb, I listen to the arguments against God and against the bible. I also realize some Christians really don&#39;t show much grace in love or a changed life to give evidence to others.. Lest I judge.</p>

<p>It continues to hold up despite our cultures negative view and mindset against it. It&#39;s so sad that so many cast off the things of God just because it doesn&#39;t fit their current paradigm IE gay marriage etc. Think about it, our culture, our government, even the religious elite of our day, are somewhat against what the bible says to be true... something to think about.</p>

<p>Jesus changed everything, the government, the secret societies etc those in power, were completely terrified of this one man, who was a carpenter, even unto crucifying him they couldn&#39;t stop his message.</p>

<p>There is a natural order to life that leads to fruitfulness, thats one of the reasons for why God created the commandments. Sin never leads to joy or fruitfulness, just pain and regrets eventually. i know I don&#39;t look back fondly on the sins of my youth.</p>

<p>If you are suffering (as we all have in many forms). Give Jesus a chance. Find out for yourself how christianity has spread so far across the globe just because of one mans death on a cross, an injustice. For he loves us, God loves us. 
John 3:16 
&quot;For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life&quot;.
That may be why he isn&#39;t destroying the wicked yet, because he wants everyone to have a chance to repent of their sin and turn to him, he does punish the evil doers, but who am I to speak to Gods will if he created the entire universe? Read the book for yourself, I&#39;m not learned enough of the bible to give an accurate statement.</p>

<p>Matthew 11:28 
<strong>&quot;Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest&quot;</strong>.
Find a local church if you can. And feel free to pm me if you have further questions. </p>

<p>Things generally are better now than they&#39;ve ever been. Higher standards of living, better health, longer life expectancies, better communications and technology and tools and comforts and toys.</p>

<p>Are things now as bad as they were during each of the World Wars ?  As bad as during the Great Depression ?  As bad as during the Black Plague ?  In USA, as bad as during the Civil War ?</p>

<p>Sure, there are lots of ways we (USA, and world) could be better. But I have no patience with those who see only the bad. USA has always had booms and crashes, robber barons, govt abuses and incompetence and ugly politics, etc. We deal with them, and gradually improve the country.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True.  But we&#39;re still top dog in the world, pretty much.  And still better than we were during and before WW II.  We&#39;re just in decline relative to our position as sole surviving major power at the end of WW II.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget the huge strengths we have. Stable, strong institutions. World-dominant or world-class industries: entertainment, software, medicine, universities, biotech, energy, finance, military, aerospace. Natural resources. Skilled people. Many people all over the world want to immigrate to USA. Investors consider USA and US govt debt to be safest places to invest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is all true. At the same time, do you not find yourself thinking &quot;Jeez, it&#39;s 2015 and yet...&quot;  Many things have not gradually improved. Climate change and ocean acidification being prime examples. Wealth inequality has been on the rise in the US for 30-40 years. Perhaps the baseline has risen, but I think we should be able to do better. </p>

<p>Also..I remember being a kid and seeing the world population clock in the 5 billion range. It is crazy to me that this number will double during my lifetime and it is not constantly talked about, especially when everyone knows the current oil supply can&#39;t sustain American-style lifestyles for everyone. I do feel like politicians shirk away from these big issues because the facts are inconvenient. </p>

<p>I think in some sense the issue of overpopulation is exaggerated.  Technology will take care of some of it, simple lack of resources will stop most people from rising to American-style lifestyles, as education rises birthrates will fall.  <a href="http://www.billdietrich.me/Reason/Rants.html#Overpopulation">http://www.billdietrich.me/Reason/Rants.html#Overpopulation</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you looked at the arguments for God? The evidences for a creator? Or have you simply kept your eye on your own dogma and not considered the intelligent design theory? Recently many prominent atheists are now speaking of an alien intelligent design. Well isn&#39;t that just clever.</p>

<p>Your being intellectually dishonest and lazy. And so is this article. It merely looks at the problems of religion and refutes an existence of God by proxy. Poor assumptions and numerous straw man arguments. The author never read the bible and the historical evidence for its claims and the scientifically evidence for a creator. </p>

<p>I will agree with some of the text you provided when it comes to religion. But the negative connotations of religion doesn&#39;t refute the existence of God. It was the super religious of Jesus&#39;s day who killed him. Institutionalized religion is mostly in error of God&#39;s word. Any enforceable action towards tithing, or a commandeering leader/teacher who is more of a henchman then a pastor, is evil taking advantage of a group of people&#39;s lack of analyze of God&#39;s word. </p>

<p>The article also cites sigmund frued who was a known occultist and believed that every son inherently wanted to kill his own father and have sex with his mother. Maybe you should come to a better understanding of the sources used for argument by the author. It gives a good critique of modern day religious institutions which I made a critique beforehand.</p>

<p>If you want me to continue viewing this material and seeing the fault with these so called &quot;facts&quot; from a pretty pathetic points of derision and argument..</p>

<p>Another point I&#39;d like to make is that evil does exist. The kabbalah cult that exists in holylwood and many conceive that it is actually the root of what is being called the illuminati in the modern day. </p>

<p>From the old testament it described the demon worship and occult activities that existed in the Israelites day. The same demons that the pagans of that day sacrificed in that day exists today in the occult activities. The molech demon and baal demon, have evidence in the big cults found today. The bohemian grove has this molech demon idol in plain view. We cannot fight evil if we don&#39;t realize the spiritual implications at hand. If you&#39;ve been viewing the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> thread enough you&#39;d realize it. </p>

<p>So I actually agree with your article in part, because of the faults and manifestations of power over people by religious dogma and institution. The christian belief &quot;system&quot; actually argues against many of these religious implementations. Also describes in prophecy that in the &quot;end times&quot; that a one world religion will rise up and behead Christians. I have personally experienced the hatred that the religious elite of our day have for a follower of Christ (follower of christ, christian, different names, some find unusual because the media portrays christians many times in a sort of cultish union).</p>

<p>I have also experienced spiritual warfare. After helping suicidal people the next day as I was laying on my bed listening to sports radio an invisible force grabbed my head and literally pushed me against the wall, I couldn&#39;t move against it, it was crushing me, I tried to cry out but nothing came out of my lungs, then I thought in my mind &quot;jesus help me!&quot; as I knew what was attacking me was a spiritual force. As soon as I said so, I was immediately relieved from the attacker. I have experienced similar events after helping the suicidal or those entrenched in demonic paganism.</p>

<p>Maybe you&#39;d like to see some of the demonic evidence? But I&#39;d rather not come to that measure.</p>

<p>Anyway, I found that article incredibly dogmatic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have much patience for &quot;arguments&quot; for God; I want to see evidence.  Philosophical arguments are just word-play.  Religious people used to claim direct evidence of God: miracles, prayers answered, prophecies that came true.  With the advent of modern communications and cameras and science and such, that has gone away.</p>

<p>I never try to &quot;refute the existence of God&quot;.  I just ask the religious for good, solid evidence to support their amazing, extraordinary claim that a god (any god) exists.  And they never have any good evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you think Stephen Hawking is being so amendment for finding aliens? Or why so many scientists are now thinking we are living in a simulation, or seeking aliens? I may be blunt, but I believe it&#39;s because atheism has fallen on its face, but their pride wont allow them to separate from dogma. I&#39;m hoping Hawkings come around like Bill Gates did, who believes in a God (whether he&#39;s a good man is another debate, I realize im on a conspiracy forum lol)</p>

<p>The proof of God is in his creation, the earth, the sun, the moon, all aligned to allow life to live on earth, the atmosphere, gravity, chemistry of plant and water and how it allows life, the sperm that leads to birth of life, the sperm and egg came from a set of human beings IE &quot;creators&quot;. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have enough time to put my resources and sources. But I will infer you to do more research on creationsim and look at both sides of the argument. That&#39;s it, thats all I ask of those who seek to refute my beliefs, give the bible an honest read through, and hear both sides of the big argument. A man that has built my faith is William Lane Craig, an academic that even hitchens and dawkins gave respect to and feared. He doesn&#39;t just debate philosophically, but scientifically brings together his views.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think Hawking wants to find aliens because he thinks they designed us.  And if we do find that, it would undercut your religion, wouldn&#39;t it ?</p>

<p>A few scientists have speculated that we could live in a simulation, and tried to devise tests of that.  I think it still is a fringe theory with no evidence supporting it.</p>

<p>Atheism hasn&#39;t &quot;fallen on its face&quot;; religion is becoming a &quot;God of the gaps&quot;, pushed into ever-smaller territory as science explains more and more, and religion fails to find evidence to support its claims.</p>

<p>Nothing about the existence of the solar system or life is proof of the existence of God.  Science can explain it in terms of some fundamental laws and the Big Bang.  We don&#39;t know what caused them or came before them, but our lack of knowledge/evidence there doesn&#39;t mean &quot;must have been God !&quot;.</p>

<p>All I ask you for is one simple, solid, clear piece of evidence that any god exists.</p>

God is described as Spirit. And biblically describes his evidence in his creation. It&#39;s self evident to me. But if the things of nature doesn&#39;t convince you then there are other evidences.  </p>

<p>Biblically, science helps prove the bible as God&#39;s word. <a href="http://www.clarifyingchristianity.com/science.shtml">http://www.clarifyingchristianity.com/science.shtml</a> </p>

<p>In the bible its described that God set his Word above his own name. That his proof also exists in his Word/bible. </p>

<p>Because of sin we became disconnected from God. Moses was allowed only to see a part of God, and its described that he had to hide himself from others because his face shined. If God truly created all of the universe, the galaxy, all, of, it. Then he would have to be one gloriously great being. It doesn&#39;t shock me that he would be invisible to us, that his greatness and might would probably shock us beyond breath, could I say, beyond belief? Which may be why he asks for faith first? He put his evidence in his Word/bible and in his creation. </p>

<p>The existence of God is also in his son Jesus. Who historians agree he existed, caused enough ruckus for the romans to agree to crucifying him. Then you have Jesus&#39;s death described in detail in Isiah, which is in the ancient Torah. </p>

<p>There are people much smarter then me that can give you some better evidences such as the man in the first link. But I do have to bring back to my earlier point and say that faith is first required by God for a particular set of reasons. </p>

<p>As for the existence of aliens.. The ancient alien theory fails when stood up to the bible. The bible speaks of fallen angels who have signs and wonders and lie to mankind to have their purposes done. Old testament, but jesus described that the days of Noah (when there were these fallen angels hanging out with men) would come back when his return is near. </p>

<p>But I do appreciate the conversation and regard the fact that we can have this discussion freely is something I&#39;m grateful for, even if we agree to disagree. But I also have to mention that the church has done a lot of good in the world, I should be more careful in how how judge church &quot;institutions&quot; when the catholic church has built numerous hospitals for example in africa and helped numerous amount of diseased and impoverished people, despite some of the terrible problems that have arisen inside catholicism.</p>

<p>Can I ask you personally why you don&#39;t believe in God? What are your beliefs/lack of beliefs? Is it because God isn&#39;t evident to your criteria of evidence?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, I don&#39;t watch conspiracy-theory videos any more, and I&#39;m not going to watch religious videos, for one of the same reasons: if you can&#39;t make your point in a paragraph or so of text, it&#39;s probably not worth making, and making a video of it usually is just an attempt to overwhelm with quantity and effects.  And it&#39;s very hard to quote from a video and dissect what is being said.</p>

<p>Yes, I don&#39;t believe in God because there is no good evidence of God.  God does not exist in reality, as far as anyone can tell.  So God belongs in the same bin as other unsupported things we&#39;ve made up, Santa Claus and Easter Bunny and so on.  You and I could make up several things right now that are just as valid and real and supported as God.</p>

<p>As far as your statements about the Bible, see <a href="http://www.billdietrich.me/Reason/ReasonReligion.html#bible">http://www.billdietrich.me/Reason/ReasonReligion.html#bible</a>  The Bible is the CLAIM, not the EVIDENCE, and contradicts itself horribly in many fundamental places (Genesis, gospels, etc).</p>

<p>Jesus probably existed as a real person.  I see no solid evidence that he was God or part of God.  We have statements by believers, written down 50 or 100 years after the fact.</p>

<p>I think the Bible probably was a political propaganda document, a way to create a narrative and motivate a people and control them.  It gathered together many oral traditions and myths, voted pieces in and out in a political process, was translated multiple times with multiple agendas applied.  It is evidence of nothing but belief.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why were jesus&#39;s followers (ie his apostles) so adamant about spreading the news of his resurrection to the point of death then? One was beheaded, another was crucified upside down, one was boiled alive etc. Christians were killed in mass by Nero. Read your history books about the early church and christianity. Your dogma is showing again.</p>

<p>As far as the gospels contradicting themselves.. Can you point out where the contradictions are? I will also remind you the verses in the Torah that predicted Jesus&#39;s death. The historical relevance for Christ is astounding.</p>

<p>Psalm 41:9:
Prophecy written: Between 520 and 518 BC
Prophecy fulfilled: About 31 AD
Even my close friend, whom I trusted, he who shared my bread, has lifted up his heel against me.</p>

<p>Zechariah foreshadowed the betrayal of Jesus for 30 pieces of silver</p>

<p>Bible prophecy: Zechariah 11:12-13
Prophecy written: Between 520 and 518 BC
Prophecy fulfilled: About 31 AD</p>

<p>In Zechariah 11:4-17, the prophet speaks of a payment involving 30 pieces of silver and of a good shepherd whose service is brought to an end. This foreshadows an event that happened to Jesus about 500 years later. As explained in Matthew 26:15, Judas was paid 30 silver coins for his betrayal of Jesus. Judas told the Romans when and where they could arrest Jesus without being surrounded by a large crowd of Jesus&#39; followers. As explained in Matthew 27:5-7, Judas later tossed the money into the Temple (the house of the Lord) and the money was used to buy a potter&#39;s field as a burial place for foreigners.</p>

<p>Zechariah 11:12-13:</p>

<p>12 I told them, &quot;If you think it best, give me my pay; but if not, keep it.&quot; So they paid me thirty pieces of silver. </p>

<p>13 And the LORD said to me, &quot;Throw it to the potter&quot;-the handsome price at which they priced me! So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them into the house of the LORD to the potter.</p>

<p>Jesus was spat upon and beaten</p>

<p>Isaiah 50:6:</p>

<p>I offered my back to those who beat me, my cheeks to those who pulled out my beard; I did not hide my face from mocking and spitting.</p>

<p>God&#39;s servant would be silent before his accusers</p>

<p>Bible prophecy: Isaiah 53:7
Prophecy written: Between 701-681 BC
Prophecy fulfilled: About 31 AD</p>

<p>In the book of Isaiah, chapter 53, Isaiah the prophet wrote about a servant of God. Many people believe that this was a prophecy about the life of Jesus Christ, who lived after the time of Isaiah. In Isaiah 53:7, the prophet said that the servant would be afflicted and accused, and that he would remain silent like a lamb being led to slaughter. As explained in Matthew 27:12-14, which was recorded about 700 years after the time of Isaiah, this is what happened to Jesus. He was falsely accused but remained silent and did not protest the accusations. Jesus was crucified by the Romans a short time later.</p>

<p>Isaiah 53:7:</p>

<p>He was oppressed and afflicted, yet he did not open his mouth; he was led like a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is silent, so he did not open his mouth.</p>

<p>God&#39;s servant would die for our sins</p>

<p>Bible prophecy: Isaiah 53:4-6
Prophecy written: Between 701-681 BC
Prophecy fulfilled: About 31 AD</p>

<p>In Isaiah 53:4-6, prophet described a servant as being punished for the sins of others, and that others would be healed by the wounds of this person. As explained in the New Testament - such as in the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John - Jesus was crucified for our sins, and he was sinless. Christians believe that this ultimate sacrifice redeemed us all from sin in the same way that lambs and other animals were once sacrificed as a symbolic way of cleansing people from sin. All of us can be accepted into the Kingdom of God, as though we were sinless, if we accept Jesus as our savior. Christians believe that we are healed through the wounds that Jesus suffered.</p>

<p>Isaiah 53:4-6:</p>

<p>4 Surely he took up our infirmities and carried our sorrows, yet we considered him stricken by God, smitten by him, and afflicted. </p>

<p>5 But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we are healed. </p>

<p>6 We all, like sheep, have gone astray, each of us has turned to his own way; and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all.</p>

<p>Zechariah foreshadowed the crucifixion of Jesus</p>

<p>Bible prophecy: Zechariah 12:10
Prophecy written: Between 520 and 518 BC
Prophecy fulfilled: About 31 AD</p>

<p>In the Old Testament book of Zechariah, chapter 12, the Bible said that there would be a time when people in Jerusalem would lament over the one who was &quot;pierced,&quot; as one mourns for the loss of a first-born son. (First-born sons were often viewed as the main inheritors of a family&#39;s legacy). Christians traditionally have interpreted this passage as a reference to the return of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who was pierced when he was crucified by the Romans about 2000 years ago. Christians believe that Jesus will return in the future to establish an everlasting kingdom.</p>

<p>The Talmud, which offers Judaism-related commentary about various Old Testament passages, makes a very Christian-like assessment of the prophecy found in the book of Zechariah:</p>

<p>&quot;What is the cause of the mourning (Zechariah 12:10)? It is well according to him who explains that the cause is the slaying of Messiah, the son of Joseph, as it is written, &#39;And they shall look upon me whom they have pierced; and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only son.&#39;&quot; -Babylonian Talmud, Sukkah 52a.</p>

<p>Zechariah 12:10:</p>

<p>&quot;And I will pour out on the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem a spirit of grace and supplication. They will look on me, the one they have pierced, and they will mourn for him as one mourns for an only child, and grieve bitterly for him as one grieves for a firstborn son.</p>

<p>God&#39;s servant would be &quot;numbered with the transgressors&quot;</p>

<p>Bible prophecy: Isaiah 53:12
Prophecy written: Between 701-681 BC
Prophecy fulfilled: About 31 AD</p>

<p>In Isaiah 53:12, the prophet wrote about a servant who would bear the sins of others and be punished side-by-side with criminals. Christians acknowledge that Isaiah&#39;s description of this servant was a prophecy that was fulfilled during the life of Jesus Christ. As explained in the book of Matthew, Jesus, though sinless, was &quot;numbered with the transgressors&quot; and crucified along with two criminals.</p>

<p>Isaiah 53:12:
Therefore I will give him a portion among the great, and he will divide the spoils with the strong, because he poured out his life unto death, and was numbered with the transgressors. For he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.</p>

<p>God&#39;s servant would be buried in a rich man&#39;s tomb</p>

<p>Bible prophecy: Isaiah 53:9
Prophecy written: Between 701-681 BC
Prophecy fulfilled: About 31 AD</p>

<p>In Isaiah 53:9, the prophet Isaiah wrote about a sinless servant being put to death with the wicked and buried with the rich. About 700 years after this was written, Jesus was put to death along with two criminals and was buried in a tomb owned by a wealthy man, as explained in the New Testament. The New Testament also says that Jesus was resurrected three days later and ascended into Heaven.</p>

<p>Isaiah 53:9:
He was assigned a grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death, though he had done no violence, nor was any deceit in his mouth.</p>

<p>The roman government hated christianity.  Nero killed christians in mass. The conspiracy theory that christianity was made up to control the populace honestly maddens me, there is no evidence for that, on the contrary the governments and powers hated christianity. </p>

<p><a href="http://nwspiritism.com/spiritist-knowledge/why-did-the-romans-hate-the-christians/">http://nwspiritism.com/spiritist-knowledge/why-did-the-romans-hate-the-christians/</a></p>

<p>The fear of a slave rebellion was a constant factor in Rome, after the year’s long marches up and down the Italian peninsula by Spartacus, the threat of having your throat slit by those who live in your Persecution of Christians involuntarily became all too real. Whereas, other deities, religions and cults reinforced the fragility of your life here on earth, meaning that you should respect the power that could exterminate you for any offense; Christianity removed that barrier, leaving the believer with the certainty, that his or her own soul could never be touched by any display of human power. This was completely unacceptable to the Romans.</p>

<p>To add insult to injury, the Christians did not share the Roman’s pride of power and conquest. In the book, a Roman Patrician exclaims, “I cannot accept a faith that annuals pride and valor!” From the Roman point of view, Christianity was no mere cult attracting the dregs of society. Too many Roman elites, along with slaves and freedmen, became members of a religion that not only rejected the basic tenants of Roman society, love of power, importance of ancestors in social standing, glory of combat, but additionally considerably raised the possibility of a massive slave revolt.</p>

<p>The force of the ideals of Christianity was a real threat to the Empire. This is why for three hundred years, the entire might of the Roman government sporadically made repeated attempts to crush the early Christians. Only in 313 AD, with the Edict of Milan issued by Emperors Constantine the Great and Licinius, was Christianity legalized.</p>

<p>Constantine the Great wasn’t satisfied to just allow the doctrine of Christianity to flow freely, he called the First Council of Nicaea in 325, at which the Nicene Creed was professed by Christians. The papacy, the Bishop of Rome, claimed temporal power using Constantine’s ascension to Emperor. Therefore, the Church began its phase of slowly corrupting the doctrine of serving and started to take on the mantle of expecting to be served by the people, with a cohort of officials with ready hands to deal with the cash. Hence, overtime, the Church became an extension of the Empire and not a potential adversary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Contradictions in the Bible: see <a href="http://infidels.org/library/modern/jim_meritt/bible-contradictions.html">http://infidels.org/library/modern/jim_meritt/bible-contradictions.html</a> , which starts with &quot;The Bible is riddled with repetitions and contradictions, things that the Bible bangers would be quick to point out in anything that they want to criticize. For instance, Genesis 1 and 2 disagree about the order in which things are created, and how satisfied God is about the results of his labors. The flood story is really two interwoven stories that contradict each other on how many of each kind of animal are to be brought into the Ark--is it one pair each or seven pairs each of the &quot;clean&quot; ones? The Gospel of John disagrees with the other three Gospels on the activities of Jesus Christ (how long had he stayed in Jerusalem--a couple of days or a whole year?) and all four Gospels contradict each other on the details of Jesus Christ&#39;s last moments and resurrection. ...&quot;</p>

<p>You can quote the Bible all you wish, but it is not evidence.  It was written by believers; it is the CLAIM.  It was written long after the events, it contains a lot of old legends and myths pasted up together, it contradicts itself, it contains much false &quot;knowledge&quot; of the time and nothing real that was not known at the time.</p>

<p>All of the prophecies you mention are somewhat vague and could fit any number of events.</p>

<p>You have not one good, solid piece of evidence that any God exists.  Miracles stopped happening when people started recording and examining events carefully in the modern era.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I discussed the evidences for God already. I stand by the cosmology argument for God. And the evidence by his Word and the historical relevance of Christ and the prophecies for Christ in the Torah as well as the eyewitness accounts of Christ and his apostles never refuting Christ even unto severe suffering and death as well as the early christians who suffered. </p>

<p>If you still disagree with this, then you and I must agree to disagree.</p>

<p>The old testament/Torah was written by jews in 711 BC. The noted verses predict Christ and his suffering.
Isaiah 53:4
&quot;Surely he took up our pain and bore our suffering, yet we considered him punished by God, stricken by him, and afflicted. But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed&quot;. </p>

<p>As for the genesis seeming contradiction. Between the creation of Adam and the creation of Eve, the Bible says (Genesis 2:19) ‘out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air’. On the surface, this seems to say that the land beasts and birds were created between Adam and Eve. However, Jewish scholars apparently did not recognize any such conflict with the account in chapter 1, where Adam and Eve were both created after the beasts and birds (Genesis 1:23–25). Why is this? Because in Hebrew the precise tense of a verb is determined by the context. It is clear from chapter 1 that the beasts and birds were created before Adam, so Jewish scholars would have understood the verb ‘formed’ in (Genesis 2:19 to mean ‘had formed’ or ‘having formed’. If we translate verse 19 as follows (as one widely used translation1 does), ‘Now the Lord God had formed out of the ground all the beasts of the field …’, the apparent disagreement with Genesis 1 disappears completely.</p>

<p>For the ark contradiction. </p>

<p>Genesis 7:2 Of every clean beast you shall take to you by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female.</p>

<p>Genesis 7:8-9 Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing that creeps upon the earth, There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah.</p>

<p>On the one hand, Genesis 7:2 says that there shall be seven of every clean beast, and on the other hand, Genesis 7:8-9 is telling us that both the unclean and clean went in ‘two and two’. But there is no contradiction here. There are seven clean animals overall, but they just entered the Ark two abreast.</p>

<p>As for the seeming contradictions of the gospel. Both accounts are true. The pertinent question is: “Is it genuinely possible for both accounts to be true?”</p>

<p>For example, Matthew and Mark wrote that “the robbers”  reviled Jesus on the cross (Matthew 27:44; Mark 15:32). Luke, on the other hand, mentioned that “one of the criminals” blasphemed Jesus (Luke 23:39, emp. added). Luke’s account is obviously different than Matthew and Mark’s, but is it necessarily contradictory? In other words, is it possible for all of these accounts to be true? </p>

<p>Again, if you have a specific contradiction in mind in the gospels please notify me.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.christianbook.com/difficulties-clear-concise-answers-genesis-revelation/norman-geisler/9780801071584/pd/071584?event=AFF&amp;amp;p=1011693">http://www.christianbook.com/difficulties-clear-concise-answers-genesis-revelation/norman-geisler/9780801071584/pd/071584?event=AFF&amp;amp;p=1011693</a>&amp;
Is a good book if you are having problems with bible verses.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;You can quote the Bible all you wish, but it is not evidence. It was written by believers; it is the CLAIM. It was written long after the events, it contains a lot of old legends and myths pasted up together, it contradicts itself, it contains much false &quot;knowledge&quot; of the time and nothing real that was not known at the time.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>The bible IE word of God, is one part of my evidences for the existence of God. As I outlined in the beginning.</p>

<p>With regard to miracles during the time of Christ his divinity caused the miracles of his day. The apostles weren&#39;t saved from suffering, the apostle paul was shipwrecked and beaten many times. The great &quot;miracle&quot; that christians hold to is that Christ was resurrected by God so that whoever believes has eternal life. </p>

<p>As for the prophecies being vague I would disagree with that strongly. The Isaiah 53 prophecy I mentioned seems clear to showcase Jesus&#39;s suffering.</p>

<p>infidels.org is your source? Are you an atheist?</p>

<p>Again, if you don&#39;t think my first paragraph is evidence for God. Then I must agree to disagree with you but hope we&#39;ve had a healthy conversation and that both of us come to knowledge and foreknowledge. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How does existence of &quot;creation&quot; prove that God exists ?  Science can explain how all of that exists, except for what caused the Big Bang and how the fundamental laws and constants were set.</p>

<p>Assume existence of creation DOES prove that God exists.  WHICH God ?  Zeus ?  Odin ?  Shiva ?</p>

<p>&quot;Propaganda piece&quot; is my guess.  It reads that way to me.  It has been used that way.  Jesus was just one of a long list of messiah-candidates; he is the one whose story happened to get codified.  The Bible gathers up and re-works many older stories and myths.</p>

I may be blunt, but I believe it&#39;s because atheism has fallen on its face, but their pride wont allow them to separate from dogma. I&#39;m hoping Hawkings come around like Bill Gates did, who believes in a God (whether he&#39;s a good man is another debate, I realize im on a conspiracy forum lol)</p>

<p>The proof of God is in his creation, the earth, the sun, the moon, all aligned to allow life to live on earth, the atmosphere, gravity, chemistry of plant and water and how it allows life, the sperm that leads to birth of life, the sperm and egg came from a set of human beings IE &quot;creators&quot;. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have enough time to put my resources and sources. But I will infer you to do more research on creationsim and look at both sides of the argument. That&#39;s it, thats all I ask of those who seek to refute my beliefs, give the bible an honest read through, and hear both sides of the big argument. A man that has built my faith is William Lane Craig, an academic that even hitchens and dawkins gave respect to and feared.

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t have to leave, you just have to live your life by your rules. You hope to effect people around you with your positive attitude and unique approach to life. You learn all the gory details so they don&#39;t have to, and when the shit comes down and they ask why it happened you are there to comfort them and tell them this was all planned long ago. You make stuff, you trade that stuff for other stuff, you read instead of watch TV, you play your own music.</p>

<p>Your mission in life changes from &quot;be like them&quot; to &quot;freak out the squares&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Evidence for God by creation and the complexities of creation and how it all works together to allow life, evidence for God by his Word, the historical accuracy for Jesus and his life (jesus, one part of the Trinity of God). God is spirit, and a creator that has created all of the universe, every planet, would simply be to glorious of a being for our flesh to see with our eyes.</p>

<p>Can you prove the bible is a propaganda piece? Do you have an understanding of the dead sea scrolls? </p>
