<p>Being arrested for a crime isn’t supposed to be the same thing as being convicted, yet many people awaiting trial suffer the ultimate penalty—death—while they’re in custody.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/mljsp0012st.pdf">A report</a> (pdf) by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) shows that 73% of those who die in jail haven’t been convicted of a crime. In addition, 29% of those who die are African-American, more than double their percentage of the U.S. population at large.</p>

<p>Studies have shown that black people are more likely to be held while awaiting trial, partly because they are assigned higher bail amounts, by thousands of dollars, than whites are. For that reason, African-Americans are more likely to be stuck in jail awaiting trial even for minor offenses.</p>

<p>BJS found that 31.3% of all jail deaths in 2012 were by suicide. </p>

<p>Texas jailers appear to show a particular indifference towards life. There have been 140 suicides in Texas jails since September 2009, according to the Houston Chronicle. That’s one every two weeks. Inmates with known mental problems, even those who have attempted before to take their own lives, are put into cells with the same means to suicide that they used previously. Not surprisingly, some inmates take full advantage of those second chances at death. But identifying at-risk inmates is the key.</p>

<p>“What is issued in the cell is secondary to properly identifying an individual that may have suicidal ideations,” Brandon Wood, director of the Texas Commission on Jail Standards, told the Chronicle. “After reviewing deaths in custody over the last few years, we keep identifying lapses in observation and proper screening.”</p>

<p>Impossible. Only someone with your massive intellect could deduce something like that. Obviously if they&#39;re waiting for a trial, they must be guilty!</p>

<p>Oh wait, except you&#39;re supposed to be considered innocent until proven guilty in this country. </p>

<p>Regardless of all of that, who cares if they&#39;re waiting for a trial or even if they are actually guilty? None of that really matters, they don&#39;t deserve to die because of it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Use the statistic of &quot;73% of suicides in Jail haven&#39;t been convicted&quot; is as fucking dishonest as you can get.</p>

<p>The majority of those being held in Jails are awaiting trial.  The main purpose of Jail is to house those awaiting to be convicted, or eventually being found not-guilty.  Once they are convicted, and sentenced then they go from Jail to a prison.</p>

<p>It suggests that only people in Jail are awaiting conviction, and convicted people are passed onto prisons. That use of the &quot;73% of Jail inmates haven&#39;t been convicted of a crime&quot; is absolute, and intentional fraud.</p>

<p>I can break it down into even further if you can&#39;t grasp that point yet.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not at all what it suggests. Most people in jail are awaiting trial so it makes sense that most people that die in jail are also awaiting trial. That was his very simple point. I&#39;m still trying to figure out what yours is.</p>

The inevitability of that conviction has absolutely zero relevance to the issue other than being a statement of facts, the problem lies in the people dying while awaiting conviction. Jail should not be such a dangerous/inhospitable/unpleasant place that people are dying or offing themselves in considerable numbers.

<p>Did anyone stop to consider the fact that they are in Jail while they are awaiting their court cases to be processed?</p>

<p>Impossible. Only someone with your massive intellect could deduce something like that. Obviously if they&#39;re waiting for a trial, they must be guilty!</p>

<p>Oh wait, except you&#39;re supposed to be considered innocent until proven guilty in this country. </p>

<p>Regardless of all of that, who cares if they&#39;re waiting for a trial or even if they are actually guilty? None of that really matters, they don&#39;t deserve to die because of it</p>

<p>INb4: &quot;it&#39;s their job to make sure they don&#39;t die!&quot; Yeah, true. But COs aren&#39;t robocops. There are up to 1500 inmates in the larger county jails. Can a limited staff keep eyes on them 24/7? As long as the officers are doing their rounds, they can&#39;t be faulted for a drunk asshole hanging himself. </p>
