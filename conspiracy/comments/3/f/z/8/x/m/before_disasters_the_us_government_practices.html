        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Title says it all. We&#39;ve been experiencing fiber cuts at a rate I&#39;ve never seen. Two cuts two years ago in Cali was unprecedented in the frequency and type. It&#39;s happening now in states all over. Especially the south west and North west. Last week an internet backbone router was taken down that impacted EVERY wireless and wireline provider in multiple states. This is no coincidence. This is something I&#39;ve never seen before. Hop on to a bridge call during one of these outages. The phrase should be reworded &#39;swears like a network engineer&#39; men and women are currently working 24 hour shifts Manning a bridge call and corporate chat rooms trying to figure this out (as always) but it&#39;s different. The fiber cut in Montana happened on a line owned by Nu-Telecom. They were speaking to ONE GUY who stated he was receiving info by email only. At 9pm the number our NOC had for the company went dark. Out of service. We couldn&#39;t speak to the company that owns the fiber. That&#39;s unheard of. This was an outage meeting PUMA 900k criteria(Potential user minutes affected). That means mandatory FCC notification of the outage and mandatory updates to FCC contacts. That&#39;s on our end and the fiber provider. Something is not right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m not really a tech person, what does this mean? When you say &quot;fiber cuts,&quot; are you talking criminal behavior? People physically cutting fiber so systems go down? Or are they just &quot;cutting out&quot; inexplicably? </p>

<p>I think pretty much everybody who frequents this subreddit senses something is up in September. Do you have any more information?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These wires have been physically cut. The too-short CNN story quotes the FBI saying likely suspects are &quot;...normal telecommunications maintenance workers or [those who] possess tools consistent with that job role.&quot;</p>

<p>Disturbing. Of course, if this is a big plot, they certainly would have people on the &quot;inside.&quot; </p>

<p>I&#39;m increasingly thinking September will be some kind of giant digital attack, maybe vaporize the banks? That would end the huge pile of debt that is a cancer on the world. Or one of the cancers. The pedophile thing is pretty bad, too.</p>

We&#39;ve been hearing about it for years, and now X-Files and Twin Peaks -- both with key alien subplots -- are returning. They are gearing up, again. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I work in one of the larger Telecom companies in the Midwest. I work directly with the NOC as well as other fix agents but I am not a telecom engineer. We see fiber issues all the time but especially in GA, TN, MI, and MT. I&#39;m not sure that I could say we have seen an increased number of cut fiber instances, but it sure is a lot. Currently we have a cut fiber in Michigan, but it is likely related to the storms that passed through a few days ago. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me it seems like a test of the infrastructure. See how rapidly it gets back up when a widespread outage happens. Like I said these fiber cuts are happening at an unprecedented frequency.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just like when the undersea cables get cut. Cut an obvious spot, have the timing perfect, while up/down-line you insert implant/splice/bend/sniffer(I hear you don&#39;t even need to cut to sniff fiber these days!), make sure stats are the same so no one sees the implant, now you have a backbone tapped! </p>

<p>Yay! (could be the Chinese for all we know though... I swear this country is drowning in incompetence)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We have had to deal with these issues as several of these offices for the company I work for have gone down due to these outages.</p>

<p>I will try and update any information or offical tickets I have regarding these in case it helps. </p>

<p>These situations all seemed very suspicious from the info I was able to gather.</p>

<p>one such outtage was Monday July 8th, TW telecom was the provider stated, there was a Fiber line&quot;cut&quot; (their words not mine) between pleasonton CA and walnut creek CA. I believe this is San Ramon area but I would have to double check.</p>
