<blockquote>
<p>Last week, a Denver man was <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_28561686/denver-da-charges-man-tampering-handing-out-jury">arrested and charged with multiple felonies</a>, but not for stealing, committing fraud, or engaging in violent crime. </p>

<p>He was targeted for attempting to educate jurors about their rights in the courtroom.</p>

<p>Mark Ianicelli, 56, set up a table outside of Lindsay-Flanigan Courthouse in Denver in order to educate jurors about jury nullification. Jury nullification is the process by which <a href="http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/zenger/nullification.html">members of juries can nullify unjust laws</a> by finding defendants charged with them not guilty.</p>

<p>Ianicelli is charged with tampering with a jury, a felony in Colorado that carries a minimum bond of $5,000. He was charged by the Denver District Attorney for <em>seven</em> counts of tampering, and has since bailed out of jail. </p>

<p>Ianicelli was in the second day of a planned three-day outreach to educate jurors entering the courtroom about the power of jury nullification. He was handing out fliers when he was arrested. His goal was to inform potential jurors about a vital, centuries-old function of juries.</p>

<p>The practice was first used in America in 1735 to <a href="http://www.personal.psu.edu/jph13/JuryNullification.html">exonerate a man of libel charges after he printed unflattering statements</a> about the Governor of New York (a British colony at the time). </p>

<p>Though he had undoubtedly printed them, the jury found him not guilty and set the precedent that members of juries could judge the morality and legitimacy of laws.</p>

<p>The United States’ first Chief Justice, John Jay, once <a href="http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/zenger/nullification.html">told jurors</a>, “You have a right to take upon yourselves to judge [both the facts and law].” Jurors would seize this right to nullify <a href="http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/zenger/nullification.html">anti-sedition laws</a> in the early 1800s that attempted to stifle free speech criticizing the newly formed United States government.</p>

<p>Judges first began <a href="http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/zenger/nullification.html">cracking down on the right to nullify</a> in the late 1800s. </p>

<p>By that time, jurors had already used nullification to challenge the <a href="http://www.history.com/topics/black-history/fugitive-slave-acts">Fugitive Slave Act</a>, which imposed heavy punishment on Northerners who aided escaped slaves from the South. Though judges came to discourage nullification, the practice went on to be useful in nullifying Prohibition-era laws.</p>

<p>Jury nullification still affects prohibition against outlawed drugs. In 2012, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/17/doug-darrell-marijuana-jury-nullification_n_1890824.html">a New Hampshire jury acquitted a Rastafarian man</a>, Doug Darrell, of growing marijuana—though he was technically guilty of the violation. </p>

<p>The jurors had been informed of their right to nullify and found the law and charges against Darrell to be unjust. They found him not guilty.</p>

<p>However, this power of the people has not gone unchecked. Though <a href="http://www.personal.psu.edu/jph13/JuryNullification.html">some states allow for the practice</a>, judges often <a href="http://www.personal.psu.edu/jph13/JuryNullification.html">fail to notify jurors</a> of their ability to nullify. </p>

<p>Activists have been <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2013/02/jury-nullification-activist-jailed-145.html">harassed and jailed</a> for attempting to inform jurors of their right to judge the morality of laws.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://fija.org/">Fully Informed Jury Association</a> (FIJA), a non-profit organization that educates jurors on their rights (and whose pamphlets Ianicelli was handing out when he was arrested), is one group that attempts to counter these suppressions by the justice system.</p>

<p>Kirsten Tynan of FIJA <a href="http://fija.org/2015/07/28/man-sharing-jury-nullification-information-arrested-in-denver/">reported on Ianicelli’s case</a>, stating that officials in Denver claimed a juror had complained about Ianicelli’s presence near the courthouse, prompting his arrest. Tynan was told Ianicelli was arrested on charges of jury tampering, which according to Colorado law, consists of:</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li><p>A person commits jury-tampering if, with intent to influence a juror’s vote, opinion, decision, or other action in a case, he attempts directly or indirectly to communicate with a juror other than as a part of the proceedings in the trial of the case.</p></li>
<li><p>A person commits jury-tampering if he knowingly participates in the fraudulent processing or selection of jurors or prospective jurors.</p></li>
<li><p>Jury-tampering is a class 5 felony; except that jury-tampering in any class 1 felony trial is a class 4 felony.”</p></li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>Though Tynan acknowledged that under some circumstances nullification activism is not legally permissible, it appears Ianicelli was within his rights. He is due back in court on August 11 to face his victimless felony charges.</p>

<p>It is more than alarming that a man attempting to facilitate and strengthen the judicial process is punished with the full force of the law—the very thing Ianicelli sought to educate jurors about. </p>

<p>As Harlan F. Stone, the 12th Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court <a href="http://www.personal.psu.edu/jph13/JuryNullification.html">said</a> in 1941, “The law itself is on trial quite as much as the cause which is to be decided.” </p>

<p>When the justice system refuses to allow jurors to be aware of their rights, let alone exercise them, the country’s entire system of “law and order” is called into question.</p>

<p>I can see the trial already.

<p>You are sadly mistaken.  Juries are free to return &quot;Not Guilty&quot; if they so decide, even if the defendant is plainly guilty.  That&#39;s just how it works.  This is the last bulwark against unjust laws, or just laws applied unjustly.  Surely even you as an attorney can see the value of this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure why I get downvoted on this sub for stating facts about our current legal system. Whether it is right or wrong, this is how the system works.

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe because your facts are wrong?</p>

<p>SO this is a very interesting discussion to me, because you are a professional at this business but you seem to be greatly mistaken on a very important (some say crucial!) feature of our legal system.</p>

<p>A directed verdict may only be &quot;not guilty.&quot;  This does not conflict or override jury nullification in any way, since jury nullification may also only return &quot;not guilty.&quot;</p>

<p>Juries absolutely have the power to judge the law and the defendant, even now in 2015.  Of course, their judgement of the law will not have power of precedent (AFAIK?) but this does not diminish their power to judge the law.  Obviously, judges generally despise this because it undermines their power, so the fact that a jury can nullify a law is obscured.  Nevertheless, the fact remains.</p>

<p>Why are you so certain that this is no longer the case?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While a directed verdict can only be issued in favor of a defense motion, the practice has been pretty much replaced with judgement as a matter of law.  Judgement as a matter of law motions can be made by either party any time after the conclusion of the opposing party&#39;s case, and if granted, the case will not be turned over to the jury.  If a prosecutor seeks judgement as a matter of law, but does not win it and the jury returns a not guilty verdict, as in &#39;jury nullification&#39; the prosecutor can then move for a judgement notwithstanding verdict.</p>

<p>Sorry about that. I think some people confuse your stating of facts with you agreeing with the state of affairs regarding jury nullification. Or who knows, Reddit...</p>

<p>What really warps my mind on this one is that informing a jury of the law is against the law. It&#39;s seem painfully obvious this is broken in the way it dictates the &quot;justice&quot; and the freedom of thought of law abiding citizens. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not American so may be the problem is more known over there? I&#39;ve heard a bit about jury nullification, found it to be one of these things that is great on paper (it is a brilliant idea that stands the test of time), but from what filters through online it seems its being very much pushed aside by a legal system that should theoretically not have the power to do so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As an attorney myself, I find it hilarious that 16 year olds in Guy Fawkes masks on this board think that this case is some sort of new precedent.</p>

<p>Jury nullification isn&#39;t in place to give people carte blanches for committing crimes. It&#39;s meant to be used to get rid of laws that are so archaic they are no longer necessary for the function of our society. The 1735 anecdote about the libel charges in the OP is a perfect example. We were moving towards a liberal society where free speech was encouraged. Jury nullification got rid of libel charges against the man insulting the Governor of New York by printing &quot;unflattering&quot; statements about him. Nowadays, every single tabloid and newspaper has the power of free speech. It was just the course where our society was heading. Traditionally juries  nullified harsh alcohol control laws, violations of slave laws and charges brought up against whites for crimes committed against blacks (especially in the South).</p>

<p>Jury nullification won&#39;t do jack shit if the Judge feels that justice hasn&#39;t been served. Directed verdicts or judgments not withstanding the verdict (JNOVs) happen all the time. </p>

<p>This is precisely the reason why law school costs so much and why you could never learn the procedure of the court system by reading &quot;free thinking&quot; articles and message boards on the internet. The premise of the American citizen representing himself in the court of law, beating his charge on his own intellect and integrity and walking out amidst applause is a very romantic one, albeit a little naive. In reality, trying to pull any of this sovereign citizen bullshit will get you laughed out of court.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do you get from Article 23 to </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Judges in Maryland . . . are required by law to inform the jury of its right to nullification.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>?</p>

<p>Edit: A simple search on WestLaw shows only one case citing Article 23 and containing &quot;jury nullification.&quot; And the use of that term is only in there because it cites a law review article which uses it in its title.</p>

<p>In fact, 5 Maryland Evidence Sec. 104:3 says that &quot;counsel . . . may not attempt to persuade the jury to . . . repeal or ignore existing law.&quot; It would be odd for courts to be required to inform juries about their right to nullify laws while prohibiting attorneys from arguing that they do so. This argument, of course, is secondary to the fact that there doesn&#39;t seem to be any affirmative basis for saying that Article 23 requires what you said it does.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, Article 23 is about the right of juries to interpret laws, not to nullify them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure why I get downvoted on this sub for stating facts about our current legal system. Whether it is right or wrong, this is how the system works. If a jury does not follow the law, a judge can issue a directed verdict that overturns their decision. Is there a better way to administer justice? Probably. I don&#39;t claim to have all the answers. However, juries do not have the power you think they do. </p>
