        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>is anyone else having re-accuring apocalyptic dreams?</p>

<p>Like not every night or every week but like once a month. Just about every month I have a dream where I see these crazy unidentifiable lights in the sky followed by a very clear meteor/comet/asteroid hitting in the distance, followed by a massive explosion and a shower of debris. So much debris that I quickly become buried chest deep. At which point I just make my peace with that reality and give way to whatever is next. Upon which I die, and begin to see the destruction from a few miles up and it is incredible. </p>

<p>Probably the only one. This isn&#39;t a conspiracy. But has anyone else experienced anything similar? It started about two years ago and now seeing all fringe Sept. 2015 event theories, its making me curious to say the least.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a theory that may pertain to some of the comments here as well. 
Have you ever walked out to your car and started humming a song then turned the car on and the song is playing on the radio?
Ever heard stories of someones fillings picking up the radio station?
Your head is a receiver and we are all picking up every signal at all times but the brain (ego) filters out info that it does feel is urgent. 
All of these signals and everyone&#39;s thoughts are bouncing around all the time but we are not in tune with our environment enough to be able to decipher this info. It&#39;s likely we would be so overwhelmed that a simple task would be difficult to focus in on with so much info bombarding our conscious. Unconsciously however, we are able to let some things filter in. Edgar Cayce said everyone&#39;s unconscious mind is connected. I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s true or not but it&#39;s something to think about. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had that happen to me once, but it was bizarre. The doubly nuts thing about was that I was living in the deep, deep south, and the Elvis Costello song &quot;Alison&quot; was suddenly in my head and I started whistling it. When I got in the car, I don&#39;t recall if it was the first radio station I turned on or one I clicked to, but they were playing &quot;Alison.&quot; You NEVER heard songs like that where I was living, and I never heard another Elvis C. song on the radio before or after during my time living there. That&#39;s always creeped me out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. The universal consciousness <em>is real</em>. I&#39;ve seen it more as a tsunami wave, forming off in the distance (I&#39;m on the beach). It could&#39;ve been caused by a meteor/asteroid or something else. But, definitely a ELE (Extinction Level Event).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s just your mind processing all the information on this sub. Usually when I watch a video of a nuclear explosion, I&#39;m bound to dream about it within the next few days. This week I&#39;m re-reading Dune, and I&#39;ve had quite a few dreams about being stranded in the desert, or there being an immense worldwide drought.</p>

<p>While I do believe there might be a financial crisis, I&#39;m almost certain that there&#39;s not going to be an apocalypse of any kind.</p>

<p>These things were falsely predicted for a good couple of thousands of years now :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just guessing, and this might sound weird, but you could be seeing what&#39;s happening in an alternate timeline. The soul incarnates in multiple timelines simultaneously in order to have more experiences and thus growth. You are however aware of only one timeline -this one. 
Now there are many theories about how timelines interact and intersect - if you go to the sub Glitch_in_the_matrix you&#39;ll find plenty of stories of people that have seemingly not only dreamt about other timelines but had vivid actual experiences where their reality or memory changed (both seemingly timeline-bleed-in effects). Many even claim they have completely shifted timelines (for example - suddenly the neighbor &#39;s car was a different color or the whole layout of a place they know well changed (a new building appears from nowhere) and anyone they ask says it has always been that way) , which is imho impossible - but very weird and scary nontheless.</p>

<p>Seriously check out some of the posts on that sub if you feel like it- even from a spiritual/esoteric mindset that I&#39;m coming from, half of the stories there are unexplainable. </p>
