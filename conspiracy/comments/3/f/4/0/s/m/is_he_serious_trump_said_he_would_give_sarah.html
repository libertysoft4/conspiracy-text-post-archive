        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>ok, so now it&#39;s <em>confirmed</em>; he IS a clown.</p>

<p>&quot;That rodent atop Donald Trump&#39;s head must be gnawing into his brain tissue. The Donald made an appearance on the Sarah Palin cult radio station MamaGrizzRadio and threatened to bring America to smouldering ruin by perhaps awarding ol&#39; moose-for-brains a post in his administration once he becomes POTUS. No, seriously, he did.</p>

<p>After singing her praises for standing up to all the &quot;disgusting lies&quot; those media meanies spouted against poor put-upon Sarah, radio host Kevin Scholla asked Trump &quot;if there is a Trump administration, could you see picking up the phone, giving the governor a call and picking her brain on some things, or perhaps having her along in some official capacity?&quot;</p>

<p>Donny couldn&#39;t jump fast enough to exclaim <em>&quot;I mean, I&#39;d love that because she really is somebody who knows what’s happening and she’s a special person, she’s really a special person and I think people know that.”</em> He goes on to assert that &quot;everyone loves her&quot; before admitting that, well, maybe not everyone loves her but then again not everyone loves her, or even him, for that matter. They must be idiots.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sarah palin is an accomplished politician, no matter how much the left and their media organ grinder monkeys smeared her as a ditsy caribou barbie caricature.  No one remembers how she fought corruption during her political career, and how favorable her record was.  It really doesn&#39;t matter to me, though, as I am not going to vote for trump anyway.  I think he will be a &#39;conservative&#39; in the mold of giuliani; i.e. anti-2nd amendment, pro-drug war, etc. etc.  By the way, the partisan leftists who will inevitably downvote me for treating sarah palin as a human being, are doing me a favor, because I don&#39;t want an upvote from their kind anyway.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Heh, you haven&#39;t done 10% of what she has done in her life, and yet you obviously hate her deeply.  I am sure that she has done nothing to you to warrant this hate, but because you saw on tv or read somewhere or one of your friends said that she could see alaska from her house and is against abortion and hunts baby deer, now she is an object of your derision.  You obviously have no idea what you are talking about, yet you were told that sarah palin was bad, so you believe it.  It has to be something like that, as you are not articulating any reasons that YOU don&#39;t like her, you are just throwing partisan talking points out there like you are stabbing a voodoo doll with a pin.  Calm down, lady, jeeze.  Hey, if I start spoon-feeding you some ideas, will you accept those without question, too?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i did reply, but it didn&#39;t post, </p>

<p>long article so i&#39;ll try to cut to the chase,</p>

<p>&quot;WHAT HAPPENED TO Sarah Palin? How did someone who so effectively dealt with the two great issues vexing Alaska fall from grace so quickly? Anyone looking back at her record can’t help but wonder: How did a popular, reformist governor beloved by Democrats come to embody right-wing resentment?</p>

<p>Palin obsessed over her image, even more than most politicians. According to Bailey, she orchestrated a campaign to inundate newspapers with phony letters praising her. This evidently became a favored tactic. Bailey even includes a letter he says she wrote under another name accusing an opponent, John Binkley, of copying her Web-site design. (Excerpt: “This may not seem like such a big deal, but not having an original idea and taking credit for someone else’s work gives us a clue of how Johne [sic] works.”) In the idiom of the Web, Palin was a troll.</p>

<p>Much of this was harmless (if also pointless) and would not have undermined her political career. Politicians from Nixon to Clinton have been similarly consumed and still flourished. But Palin also committed more-serious ethical breaches. The most notorious of these involved her attempts to get her former brother-in-law, a state trooper, fired, and included Palin’s removal of the trooper’s boss when he didn’t comply with her wish. An investigation by the legislature found that, in some of her actions, she had abused her powers.</p>

<p>Palin seems to have been driven by a will to advance herself and by a virulent animus against anyone who tried to impede her. But this didn’t prevent her from being an uncommonly effective governor, while she lasted. On the big issues, at least, she chose her enemies well, and left the state in better shape than most people, herself included, seem to realize or want to credit her for. It’s odd that someone so preoccupied with her image hasn’t gotten this across better. And it raises the question of what she could have achieved.</p>

<p>“The thing that strikes me again and again is that she was so single-minded when she got here,” Gregg Erickson, a former senior state economist and co-founder of the Alaska Budget Report, an influential political newsletter, told me. “The problem with amateurs in politics is that they often lack that focus. She had it. She was terrible at running a staff, and given that, it’s amazing she was successful. But on the issues she made the focus of her administration—the oil tax and the gas line—she had good staff, listened to them, and backed them up. She was a transformative governor, no question. If it hadn’t been for her stunning ability to confuse personal interests and her role as governor, she could have gone on to be tremendously successful.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, yeah.  I can find articles online that say that bigfoot lives in peoples backyards, that is why I find it abhorrent to throw links at people.  Do you expect a poltician to be perfect, or else they suck, is that it?  I am sure a lot of your favorite democrat politicians have spotless records, right?  You are obviously very partisan, and very bitter towards palin for some reason that you can&#39;t seem to articulate beyond ad hominem attacks.  Is it just that thing that women get where they automatically hate each other, like maybe they are wearing the same shoes or something like that?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes, she has done a lot. if i say i&#39;m impressed would that make a difference? </p>

<p>probably not. </p>

<p>whether you like it or not, i will continue to have my opinion, as i will allow you, yours. i don&#39;t care what you think about Obama, he&#39;s on  his way out if you hadn&#39;t noticed, so nitpicking is useless.</p>

<p>found this, it is a long read, but interesting.</p>

<p>&quot;Throughout most of its history as a territory and, after 1959, as a state, Alaska was a tenuous proposition, a barren outpost rich in resources yet congenitally poor because the outside interests that extracted them didn’t leave much behind. The main obstacle to statehood was convincing Congress that Alaska wouldn’t immediately go bust. It still relies heavily on aid from Washington, and that, combined with the federal government’s holding title to 60 percent of its land base (the state itself holds 28 percent more), generates a robust resentment of federal power. The colonial mind-set is reinforced by the intensity of the state’s politics, a common attribute of remote settlements like Alaska, as the historian Ken Coates has noted—think Lord of the Flies.</p>

<p>To suddenly strike it rich opens up all sorts of possibilities, but there can be problems too. The legislature exhausted its fortune without meeting Alaskans’ outsize expectations. And although oil brought jobs and revenue, it also ensured that a state long accustomed to economic subservience would be beholden to a powerful new interest. Oil is more important to Alaska than the movie business is to Los Angeles or the auto industry is to Michigan. Stephen Haycox, a professor at the University of Alaska at Anchorage, writes in Frigid Embrace, his history of the state’s political economy, “The oil industry is, for all practical purposes, Alaska’s only private economy.”</p>

<p>This binds the state’s fortunes not just to the price of oil but also to the fate of the three giants that dominate Alaska: BP, ExxonMobil, and ConocoPhillips. Oil taxes supply almost 90 percent of the general revenue, so oil is the central arena of state politics. The industry is forever trying to coax lower taxes, lighter regulation, and greater public investment by promising jobs and riches—or, on occasion, threatening to withdraw them.</p>

<p>. . .At first, her team tried to win the Republicans over. But it became clear this wasn’t going to happen. So Palin did something that would be hard to imagine from her today: <em>she pivoted to the Democrats</em>. “We sat down with her and said, ‘If you want to get something passed, it’ll have to be much stronger,’” Les Gara, a liberal House member, told me. “And to give her credit, she did what she needed to get a bill passed.”</p>

<p>In the end, Palin essentially grafted the Democrats’ proposal onto her own. What she signed into law went well beyond her original proposal: ACES imposes a higher base tax rate than its predecessor on oil profits. But the really significant part has been that the tax rate rises much sooner and more steeply as oil prices climb—the part Democrats pushed for. </p>

<p>The tax is assessed monthly, rather than annually, to better capture price spikes, of which there have been many. ACES also makes it harder for companies to claim tax credits for cleaning up spills caused by their own negligence, as some had done under the old regime.</p>

<p>Four years later, Palin’s gas line hasn’t gotten going, but it’s not really her fault. Plunging natural-gas prices have made the project uneconomical. Her oil tax is a different story: though designed to capture more revenue under most scenarios, ACES has raised a lot more money than almost anyone imagined. That’s largely because of high oil prices. But it also shows that the law is working. </p>

<p>ConocoPhillips, BP, and ExxonMobil have reported record profits—so it’s fitting that, in a sense, Alaska has, too. It’s no exaggeration to say that ACES has made the state one of the fiscally strongest in the union. Flush with cash, Alaska produced large capital budgets that blunted the effects of the recession. Moody’s just upped the state’s bond rating to AAA for the first time. While other states reel under staggering deficits, budget cuts, and protests, Alaska has built up a $12 billion surplus, most of it attributable to Palin’s tax. Galvin estimates that it has raised $8 billion more than Murkowski’s tax would have. But given the corruption that plagued the PPT, a better benchmark might be the tax it supplanted—the one put on the books after the Exxon Valdez spill. By that measure, Palin’s major achievement has probably meant the difference between a $12 billion surplus and a deficit.</p>

<p>WHAT HAPPENED TO Sarah Palin? How did someone who so effectively dealt with the two great issues vexing Alaska fall from grace so quickly? Anyone looking back at her record can’t help but wonder: How did a popular, reformist governor beloved by Democrats come to embody right-wing resentment?</p>

<p>A big part of the answer is that the qualities that brought her original successes—the relentlessness, the impulse to settle scores—weren’t nearly so admirable when deployed against less worthy foes than Murkowski and the oil companies. In Alaska, she applied those qualities to fulfilling the promises that got her elected, and in her first year was the most popular governor in the country. “It was very, very powerful stuff,” Anita Dunn, a Democratic strategist for Knowles, and later for Barack Obama, told me. “She was this dowdy, but very attractive, person who drew a lot of support from progressive women. She was serious business.”</p>

<p>But even before she left the state, she let herself be distracted by the many grievances she harbored against a wide range of enemies.</p>

<p>Palin obsessed over her image, even more than most politicians. According to Bailey, she orchestrated a campaign to inundate newspapers with phony letters praising her. This evidently became a favored tactic. Bailey even includes a letter he says she wrote under another name accusing an opponent, John Binkley, of copying her Web-site design. (Excerpt: “This may not seem like such a big deal, but not having an original idea and taking credit for someone else’s work gives us a clue of how Johne [sic] works.”) In the idiom of the Web, Palin was a troll.</p>

<p>Much of this was harmless (if also pointless) and would not have undermined her political career. Politicians from Nixon to Clinton have been similarly consumed and still flourished. But Palin also committed more-serious ethical breaches. </p>

<p>The most notorious of these involved her attempts to get her former brother-in-law, a state trooper, fired, and included Palin’s removal of the trooper’s boss when he didn’t comply with her wish. An investigation by the legislature found that, in some of her actions, she had abused her powers.&quot;</p>

<p>There are many valid reasons for an unfavorable opinion of Palin that have nothing to do with MSNBC.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why do you attack women? </p>

<p>Valid criticism is not the same as an attack.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>She&#39;s a woman isn&#39;t she? </p>

<p>So.  All men do not agree with Obama just because they have the same gender.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or is it you just do not like her politics? </p>

<p>As a woman, it seems to me that Palin is an awful example for a female politician because she is a quitter who is ignorant about reading, geography, economics,  et al.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Heh, you haven&#39;t done 10% of what she has done in her life, and yet you obviously hate her deeply.  I am sure that she has done nothing to you to warrant this hate, but because you saw on tv or read somewhere or one of your friends said that she could see alaska from her house and is against abortion and hunts baby deer, now she is an object of your derision.  You obviously have no idea what you are talking about, yet you were told that sarah palin was bad, so you believe it.  It has to be something like that, as you are not articulating any reasons that YOU don&#39;t like her, you are just throwing partisan talking points out there like you are stabbing a voodoo doll with a pin.  Calm down, lady, jeeze.  Hey, if I start spoon-feeding you some ideas, will you accept those without question, too?  </p>
