<p>What if civilization has risen, fallen, risen, fallen, risen, fallen over and over again.. each time, killing 99% of people on Earth and wiping out everything. Each time, we&#39;re knocked back to caveman status. The NWO knows this. This time, they&#39;re going to stop the cycle, though it involves killing 80% of us, and force us into a sustainable equilibrium, ala the <a href="http://www.thegeorgiaguidestones.com/message.htm">Georgia Guidestones</a>. All the satanism, wars, pedophilia control systems, drug trafficking... They&#39;re necessary to make sure the plan is executed correctly.</p>

<p>Either 80% die, but the survivors live on in a utopia.... Or 99% die and we rebuild from scratch. Again.</p>

<p>Just a troublesome hypothesis at this point; just connecting dots, with pencil. But if you look into <a href="http://grahamhancock.com/">Graham Hancock&#39;s</a> work, it&#39;s clear that humans have been around for much, much longer than we&#39;re being told. So yeah, thousands of years ago.</p>

<p>This is a very dark, very sad part of the great conspiracy. It relates to the present UK pedophile scandal and is addressed often in this subreddit:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1cm0t3/original_research_the_mountain_of_evidence_for_a/?ref=search_posts">[ORIGINAL RESEARCH] The Mountain of Evidence for a Massive International Pedophile Ring Protected by Police and Intelligence Agencies</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Here&#39;s a good summary:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.theeventchronicle.com/intel/bad-things-recommended/">http://www.theeventchronicle.com/intel/bad-things-recommended/</a></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Here is a brief description of atypical entry test or ritual to a candidate for membership in the Organized Crime Cabal. he prospect who typically has the potential to be a rising Political Star will be introduced to someone with a soiled track records but lots of money who will offer a partnership of employment to the potential recruit. If the Recruit takes the bait and allows himself to become compromised he is brought into the Organized Crime Cabal and positioned for an additional test of increasing human compromise, if passed can catapult that person all the up the Cabal’s food chain to the highest levels.</p>

<p>This might typically be an invitation to a special party of super-elites, Top Policy-Makers who occupy very high positions in the Cartel. Drinks are provided by formally dressed butlers or waitresses and contain either a hypnotic like Placidyl, or a date rape drug like Rohypnal, Scopololine (aka Boradanga) or even a Mickey (Chloral Hydrate). Things get fuzzy and the next thing the “Rising Star” realizes is that he finds himself waking up having sex with a child of either sex.</p>

<p>The host catches him, the “Rising Star feels intense shame and is very confused. The host tells him that things must have gotten out of hand, but not to worry, that sometimes these parties get wild and out of control. The host becomes the Rising Star’s new sponsor and explains that sometimes these parties have very young adults that look like kids to entertain the “Big Boys” and this is what happens sometimes. The Host explains that at such a high level in the power structure there is complete trust between compatriots and they cover for each others weaknesses or mistakes. Of course the episode is videoed and photographed and kept “in the can” ready to have the Cabal-owned Controlled Major Mass Media (CMMM) publish a story that will ruin the “Rising Star” forever within 48 hours if he strays outside his new allowed parameters. This process was featured in the movie “Eyes Wide Shut” by producer Stanley Kubric who was believed to be an “insider”.</p>

<p>Now in order to move up to the next level of power a Rising Star must allow himself to be even more compromised, but such is always met with huge increases in rewards, perks, status and income provided (often as “set-aside allocations in foreign numbered bank accounts), so there is very high motivation to advance, especially because Rising Stars have known sociopathic tendencies or they would never have been selected in the first place or entrusted with high positions in the cabal.</p>

<p>Ultimately this process of incrementally increased human compromise leads to a highest level test which can include attending a pedophile party. Sometimes at the highest levels the party is at a hunting lodge and naked kids are hunted like game with high powered rifles. Sometimes babies are sacrificed and their hearts eaten. Sometimes children are sacrificed and then dismembered.</p>
