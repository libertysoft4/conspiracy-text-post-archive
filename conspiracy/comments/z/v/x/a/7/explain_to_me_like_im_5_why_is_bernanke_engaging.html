        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m having a difficult time wrapping my mind around the whole concept.  If we are an oil based economy, why are we driving the price of the Dollar down, when oil has begun to be traded in other currencies?  I also understand that the QE3 funds are going directly to mortgage backed securities...the same securities that were proven to be so idiotic that they couldn&#39;t tie their own shoes in 2008.  </p>

<p>I admit, I am not an economic savvy individual, but I do have (some) common sense, and all of this just confuses the hell out of me.  Can someone please explain what the hell is going on in the FED?</p>

<p>What makes this instance of martial law being purported to happen any different than the last two decades of it going to happen? Actually asking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean I don&#39;t have the right answer or maybe even a good one, but here&#39;s what I think. </p>

<p>Back in the early 90&#39;s the middle class was still strong. Most people new when they were retiring, had extra spending money, didn&#39;t have to worry about bills really. Most people were content with their lives. </p>

<p>Now, hell, wages haven&#39;t really increased any significant amount, inflation rises, we&#39;re past peak oil, the middle class is crumbling at an accelerated rate, the weather is acting abnormally around the globe, food prices are soaring, people are having a hard time just getting to work. People are starting to become displeased with their lives and the way things are going. Marshall law will either be a catalyst to the revolution, or done at the right time, shut it off completely. </p>

<p>Just my 2 cents tho. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I half agree with you.  Yes in the long run the market does not care about how many dollars are in the system but I disagree on the second part.  Printing money does not spur output if it did then Keynesian economics would have a better track record at solving problems.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I&#39;m not a fan of Keynesian economics either.  Government spending cannot increase overall economy-wide spending, unless the monetary authority permits that expansion to occur.  Which if that&#39;s all they wanted (more spending) why not just print the money and let the free market allocate it?  </p>

<p>And so increasing money supply isn&#39;t really Keynesian - it&#39;s a monetarist idea, which Milton Friedman was probably the most prominent monetarist.  He pretty convincingly showed the Great Depression of the 1930&#39;s was caused by the Fed contracting the money supply.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay - lets continue the pizza analogy.<br/>
You have a pizza and four people ready to eat, so the guy with the pizza cutter (who didn&#39;t pay for the pizza) slices it into four equal pieces, got it? 
Then 15 more people show up and want pizza too. So the guy with the pizza cutter cuts the other 3 peoples slices into 18 really small slices... and keeps his one big slice for himself.<br/>
But wait, there&#39;s more. The guy with the pizza cutter then takes those 18 really small slices of pizza and takes 40% of each slice of those for himself too.<br/>
TA DA! Economics.<br/>
(HINT: The guy with the pizza cutter that didn&#39;t pay for the pizza is really the Bank here.) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>no it does not. To understand what I was trying to say better ask yourself which has more pizza, a pizza sliced into 5 slices or 10 slices?  The answer is of course that they are the same amount just sliced differently. This is also true of money. You might have $1000 in the bank before and after a round of money printing but the value of that $1000 is now less by the same percentage of increase in printed money. This is always true as money printing always causes real inflation. So back to the pizza idea, no matter how much money is printed the sum of all that money always has the same buying power just like no matter how you slice a single pizza there is always the same amount.  You might have 5 large slices or 5 small slices but you don&#39;t have the same amount of pizza. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is why people are wrong to say &quot;take your money out of the bank, it&#39;s safer&quot;. Whether its in the bank or not, your purchasing power is being depleted and your $1000 now will not be a $1000 later. You need to invest your money in something that has lasting or increasing value, like Gold. Alternatively you open a business that flourishes in hard economic times like a dollar store.</p>

<p>The £1 item stores have done very well in the UK and so have electronic items for cash stores. It&#39;s really not unwise to stock up on non perishable foods either and although the doomsday scenario has been going for years, you don&#39;t want to be in a position of having no food or water for an unforeseen amount of time. The Federal Reserve is basically printing money and loaning it out a 0% for their subsidiaries. Foreign banks got a large amount of bailout money and some banks that part own the fed are not American.</p>

<p>This is the stage where the Federal Reserve and other central banks are giving themselves money and hoarding it for when the collapse happens. There&#39;s been numerous stories about banks failing to lend to small business (little people) and stories on how the elite have amassed Trillions in offshore accounts. This is so after the crash they are positioned to buy up everything for pennies on the Dollar and have even more financial leverage over the planet. This is a well planned, meticulous destruction of the global economy and the biggest fraud in history.</p>

<p>Let me get this straight:</p>

<p>FED floods staggering economy with more money...to &quot;increase job growth&quot;.  But they do so by purchasing mortgage securities, okay, flood the banks with money.  If the loans on the homes default, the banks are left holding the bag, a big bag, filled with the FED&#39;s money (obviously).  So then the FED owns the property?  Why?

    <div class="md"><p>With fiat currencies devaluation has to take place as there is always more debt in the system than currency.  Therefore all fiat currencies have regular periods of devaluation to keep the scam alive. In the case of the dollar the measured devaluation was misjudged Badly several times forcing the giant size &quot;printing&quot; of money in an attempt to get back in front of the scam.  It&#39;s not working and we are probably going to see a dollar revaluation some time in the next 10-20 years. </p>

<p>To expand on above (not easy to type on iPad) printing/devaluing is the process where you loan money to pay off the last debt but at interest yet again. Since nobody can pay the central bank back the moment the currency is issued interst is charged, thus there will never be a way to pay off the debt. </p>

<p>Anybody that thinks the US or any other country can balance a budget does not understand how central banking works. The US has to run deficits to keep the system in motion.  In previous decades when real inflation was lower you might have gotten away with a balanced budget for a few years but globally there is always going to be more debt than money. No country will be powerfull enough to win the game long term.  </p>

<p>As I see it, fiat currencies have nothing to do with debt.  The reason there is debt is because of usury.  Fiat just makes it easier to create an interest bearing loan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not true. If you could look at a balance sheet showing all dollars held vs all debts owed the system always creates a larger amount of debt that means to pay it. To some extent the interest rate charged does not matter. The rate charged does obviously effect the borrowers chances of being able to pay back the loan but the system is rigged to cause a certain percentage to default no matter what the rate. In the US rates are at all time lows. You can borrow for a house at close to 3%. 3% is not a usury type rate but again since there is more debt than money somebody is always going to default no matter how hard they work or how smart they plan. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Usury is defined as the charging of interest on a loan. Colloquially, it has come to mean only <em>exorbitant</em> or <em>predatory</em> amounts of interest, whatever that is supposed to mean.</p>

<p>Something I find interesting is that interest is prohibited in both islam and christianity. Christianity has chosen to ignore this, of course, at least in the west. If one obtains a loan from an islamic bank, however, there s no rate of interest paid - they get around this by charging fees.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. The main passage is Dueteronomy 23:19 &amp; 20:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>19 Thou shalt not lend upon usury to thy brother; usury of money, usury of victuals, usury of any thing that is lent upon usury:</p>

<p>20 Unto a stranger thou mayest lend upon usury; but unto thy brother thou shalt not lend upon usury: that the Lord thy God may bless thee in all that thou settest thine hand to in the land whither thou goest to possess it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For jews, this means they are allowed to charge interest to non-jews. There are also passages in Ezekiel and Leviticus, one of which describes a righteous man by saying he does not charge usury.</p>

<p>When you think about the fact that fiat currencies are always losing value over time it would seem unfair to not charge interest in certain transactions.  If I loan a friend a $1000 for a year and he pays me back at the end of that year I gave him something worth more than what he repaid.  I wonder if the religious people that do not believe in any type of interest would agree that you at least should pay back the loan with say the current rate of inflation.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, there is a passage in the bible which states, an I am paraphrasing here: when you lend to someone in a venture, you are entitled to a share of the profit. So, it is describing what we generally think of as investment.</p>

<p>Your last sentence is getting into the area of begging the question, I think, but I would assume that the answer has to do with the idea of sharing in the profit of the venture as above. Any inflation would be equally felt by both the lender and the lendee, so it is essentially a non-factor.</p>

<p>(I say &#39;begging the question&#39; because inflation in the absence of interest-based currency, while historic such as in colonial Spain, seems more the result of extraordinary circumstance or happening over the extreme long term. But I may be all wet here.)</p>

<p>EDIT: <strong>In my opinion</strong> these proscriptions are aimed at ending speculation. The desire is for people to be <em>invested</em> in their communities in every way, and not just out to make a quick profit by whatever means.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree a bit on the inflation idea.  If I spend the money now instead of loaning it to a friend it has greater buying power now than it does when he returns the money later.  So even though I still have the same amount its technically worth less.  My finances would be better off never making the loan unless I had no intention of spending the money until a date later than that of the repayment.</p>

<p>As I see it, fiat currencies have nothing to do with debt. The reason there is debt is because of usury.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wow... you <strong>really</strong> don&#39;t understand the concept behind fractional reserve central banking.</p>

<p>beyond the fact that fractional reserve banking creates money at rate of 9 to 1 (9 dollars are just willed into existence for every 1 dollar actually held)</p>

<p>beyond the fact that the 9 dollars issued for the 1 dollar held &quot;exist&quot; exclusively on the hope that the person/organization that borrowed will pay the loan back</p>

<p>beyond the fact that almost every asset backing a loan depreciates</p>

<p>beyond the fact that, in addition the 90% of the new money supply being a complete debt issuance, the central bank then charges interest on that 90% debt issuance (that, when considered in the context of amortization brings the debt issuance above to 95%)</p>

<p>beyond the concept of a central banking debt treadmill that eventually produces debt service that exceeds GDP growth and interest rates that stop reflecting risk because once they rise above the ~7% they become obviously unsustainable even with the sovereign ability to levy taxes.</p>

<p>beyond the fact that the US government only collect about 2 trillion in taxes to apply against a 12 trillion budget (and has been doing this for decades)</p>

<p>beyond the fact that most of the debt the US government owes (hence its people via sovereign ability to tax) is owed to not only its people, but external countries.</p>

<p>...I don&#39;t really know if I can explain just how deluded you are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well let me explain it like this.</p>

<p>Those few aging white men who actually govern the United States are well aware since the late 1980s this party they have been enjoying was bound to end. Now some of these aging men died from being old by the time of since Gulf War 1, but the ranks  of the hyper entitled welled steadily as their kids slowly aged to become AWRM themselves. The new crop of highly entitled aging white men that are now the governing elite behind the political elite of the US are even more aware (and not much in denial) the party is seriously close to over.</p>

<p>So why &quot;is the party over&quot; ? Well largely because they have run a scam for a few decades. In the early 20th century Woodrow Wilson was scammed to turn over money creation to the banking technocrats. This did allow the US power elite to leverage the explosive industrial potential signified by automated assembly and high density energy sources (primarily oil) in to a brief and erratic era of unbridled affluence. The way they did this was by means of a trick they dubbed &quot;capitalist economy&quot;. There has never been anything like this, and what we would have called capitalim before 1900 was a completely different animal than the one of the mid to late 20th century. 
The whole process was about unbridled mobilization of natural resources and labour. To do that the system (especially after WW2) was spurred on to fever pitch productivity largely because the Aging White Men were terrified of socialism. They shouldn&#39;t have been, since socialism and communism also produced a crop of Aging White Rich Men behind the Iron curtain - I suppose humanity is pathologically predisposed towards &quot;governance by the maximum ruthlessness silverbacks&quot;. The mobilization of capital is quintessentially the mobilization of money. The system needed an unchallenged monetary exchange system - sort of like &quot;<em>the perfect shiny beads and mirrors</em>&quot; that would be globally in demand. This just happened to be the dollar, which everyone needed world wide as all people traded all things that meant anything back and forth with dollars. This went pretty well for a long time. The dollar-backed Pax Americana kept the world prosperous for the better part of a century and has signified an industrial explosion and raw progress this part of the galaxy has never seen before. This rate of growth and progress (regardless of what metric you use to chart or measure it; per capita growth is a lousy metric - energy growth is a better one) hinged completely on oil. Oil signified the most dense energy source and carrier available so all progress (quite often military progress) was directly attributable to the price of refined gasoline at the most inaccessible end user. </p>

<p>Sadly all this growth meant several severely bad side effects all of which hinge on the gradual depletion and increasing cost to produce oil. </p>

<p>(1) people had to educate themselves to benefit from taking part in this &quot;economic&quot; shell game. Educating monkeys takes a lot of money and time. The people that educated themselves were paid a lot for a while so that wasn&#39;t an issue. But now the benefit of this education is waning and people aren&#39;t much in demand as the underlying energy source is gradually becoming more scarce. The highly skilled, mentally conditioned and motivated workers are left holding the bag in terms of spectacular educational debts.</p>

<p>(2) A highly complex society with service jobs and infrastructure required stability. The best way for many decades to enforce stability was to just give people on &quot;the lower half of society&quot; some free money, in terms of welfare, free streets, free medicines. This was over-all cheaper than killing them outright, or putting them in prisons. This hinged on &quot;human rights&quot;, which is largely a derivative of democracy and various civil rights movements and it is largely a luxury mechanism. Only rich societies can &quot;afford&quot; people with &quot;rights&quot;: Take away affluence and people will causally lose rights, one way or another. The latter is now well and plain visible and they call it &quot;austerity&quot;.</p>

<p>(3) All that affluence and money and welfare and cheap medicine and food sloshing around for a century has grown the world&#39;s population from two billion to a mostly inescapable implicit nine billion completely unsustainable train wreck later this century. It doesn&#39;t matter if these people all live in the third world - the total sum of humanity can not afford to let people starve in a world with NBC weapons running around, since mass starvation directly translates to NBC terrorism and eventually NBC warfare. Think - water wars. Think - topsoil depletion.</p>

<p>(4) Climate &quot;wyrding&quot;. Nuff said. Irreversible catastrophe by now, will itself kill at least a billion people prematurely before 2100.  Directly attributable to industrial activity.</p>

<p>(5) People got older. Pension crisis, etc. Catastrophic all by itself. </p>

<p>(6) Automated labour displacing human labour, etc.</p>

<p>Around Bush1 those old white men in charge realizes this was going nowhere and they started formulating a highly racist strategy to stay rich in a world where collective global and societal wealth would dwindle to a fraction before long. All stuff with &quot;money&quot; is just meaningless. You have to calculate what a dollar buys you in necessities. Look at the value of this money ad you will see the Aging White Rich Men have been purposefully leveraging the monetary system to make you poorer since the 1970s, when it was clear the bedrock fundament of industrial progress (hint : it is black and sticky and it smells) was going to run out. Some of these Aging White Men ran on denial and on automatic pilot (oh by 2000 we will have cities on the moon, fusion, flying cars etc.) and they assumed &quot;we&#39;ll think of something&quot;. Well we didn&#39;t and now the actual struggle isn&#39;t much about that bullshit we used to call economic growth anymore (which was just another way of stating HOW FAST the money presses could efficiently overclock the arguably productive  elements of society over any less productive ones) but it was more about the Aging White Rich Men could consolidate their hold over dwindling natural resources, scarce original skill sets (rare skilled staff), the sexiest lingerie models, the real estate with the best view, and oil. Nothing else matters to these Aging Rich White Men. They want what they assume is theirs.</p>

<p>Money will deflate exponentially away in to irrelevance and we will have a highly abstract, scarcity-centered new mechanism of exchange, more based on constraint and rationing than anything else. The Aging White Rich Men will not take part in this new global rationing system (which will probably be called &quot;credits&quot;) as they will sit behind protective barbed wire walls, protected by automated systems. The AWRM will become a new feudal aristocracy that will quickly evolve away from the 99% of humanity. By 2040 they will probably have access to life extension and rejuvenation and by 2100 they will probably not even be human anymore.</p>

<p>The process of flooding the markets is a last ditch effort of the &quot;fed&quot; (and similar entities) to overclock what&#39;s left of the &quot;economy&quot; shell game. Kind of like giving shots to a dying patient to keep him alive for a few more months. </p>

<p>Soon this system will make place for a new system of managing things. If things go wrong, the new system will be starkly dystopian, quite poor, very miserable for more than half of humanity, based on rather lean rationing of food, living space, water, services, medical care. The average living conditions will go down appreciably from what we are all used to and will probably stay that way for a few decades. Average lifespan will go down a decade in most countries. People who &#39;retire&#39; will probably have medical care severely rationed. Life in much of the world will closely resemble Cuban life by 2020. Cuban already lived through this downward transition a few decades ago.</p>

<p>The FED isn&#39;t an organization that makes money. It is an organization that has been exclusively looking at he interests AWRM and has been hosing those interests down with a slimy green foam we mistake for money. All that money is essentially a coolant foam that has kept the machines of progress from overheating. Sadly the machines of progress are old and worn and the last ditch spurt of money expansion has lost much of its context.</p>

<p>QE4 will have more tangible uses. The &#39;money&#39; we get by then will be in handy green bricks you can throw right in your wood stove to keep warm during winter. </p>

<p>Right now people and banks want to hold cash more than holding real goods, like buildings or big machines.  QE3 helps raise prices for all real goods, so people are encouraged to buy real goods sooner rather than later.  And then people stop sitting on cash, they start investing and consuming like normal.</p>
