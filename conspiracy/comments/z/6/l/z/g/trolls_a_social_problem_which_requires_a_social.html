        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Trolls suck. But, some suck harder than others.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, I believe I may have a solution - a social solution. </p>

<p>We all know how annoying trolls can be, especially if they have decided to put you on their list of perpetual targets. And, I&#39;m not talking about your ordinary run-of-the-mill trolls, here. Nor am I talking about those who troll for the purpose of gaming the [various] reddit community[/-ies]. No. Right now, I want to focus on a very specific type of troll. Specifically, I&#39;m talking about those who do nothing but troll for the sole purpose of harassment. The cyberbully variety.</p>

<p>In this post, I shall focus on two very specific individual trolls who have repeatedly made appearances in this subreddit and who have distinctly different approaches to trolling. Feel free to peruse their comment histories to confirm that I&#39;m not simply targeting people who are disagreeable or otherwise generally annoying. These two examples make pointed, targeted, personal attacks.</p>

<hr/>

<hr/>

<p><strong>The Frontal Assault Troll</strong></p>

<p><a href="/u/SilentNick3">/u/SilentNick3</a></p>

<p>This troll attacks while discussions are new and hot. His tactic appears to be that of disrupting the flow of interaction for the purpose of sidetracking those whose voices he wishes to silence. If the topic is important enough to other trolls, he is sometimes joined by others (a &quot;following&quot; of a sort).</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>The Rear Assault Troll</strong></p>

<p><a href="/u/CowzGoesMoo">/u/CowzGoesMoo</a></p>

<p>This troll attacks recently dying threads -- nothing more than a day or two old (usually - although, he has been known to dig back as far as 2 weeks, if he&#39;s being particularly aggressive). Because of his notoriety, he avoids new threads where he is subject to instant burial. This is a cowardly sort of troll who attacks just as you think some topic has finally been laid to rest.</p>

<hr/>

<p>These two trolls are not problematic in r/conspiracy alone. They stalk their targets in numerous subreddits and across a myriad of topics.</p>

<p>And, while these are not the only two trolls on reddit (there are hundreds), they do seem to be the two most aggressive trolls in r/conspiracy. Thus, why I&#39;ve chosen to use them as examples in this post.</p>

<hr/>

<hr/>

<p>So, what is the solution? </p>

<p>Banning them from a single subreddit isn&#39;t very effective, because they do continue to relentlessly stalk their targets and harass them in other subreddits, as well.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s my proposal. And it&#39;s not just for these two trolls. It is a proposal which can be applied to fighting trolls throughout all of reddit.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Once a person has been identified as being a habitual troll (as in the case of the two examples above - evidenced by their comment histories), they should be ostracised by the community. </p>

<p>Specifically, I mean this: </p>

<p>DO NOT RESPOND TO THEM - EVER.</p>

<p>DOWNVOTE EVERY COMMENT THEY MAKE. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.</p>

<p>If you have RES (Reddit Enhancement Suite), you can flag them with a specific color and a label to remind you to do this.</p>

<hr/>

<p>What about all of the other trolls?</p>

<p>This is where we must organize and act with one voice - AS A COMMUNITY.</p>

<p>Suggestion: Two subredddits dedicated to identifying and confirming specific troll accounts.</p>

<p>Subreddit One: A public (self-post only) subreddit which collects recommendations from the community, and which allows discussion and vetting to confirm the despicable nature of said trolls.</p>

<p>Subreddit Two: A semi-public (restricted self-post only) subreddit which only allows posts made by elected members of Subreddit One (above). This subreddit takes the most highly voted and most thoroughly vetted recommendations from Subreddit One (above) and places them into &quot;official public retribution&quot; status - trolls to be buried by the community at large (flagged in RES, etc.).</p>

<hr/>

<p>This may not be the perfect plan, but at least it is a plan. A plan for a social solution (community unity) to a social problem (harassment trolls). No private conspiracy. All open to public inspection.</p>

<hr/>

<p>If you like this idea, share it with others that you think will like it as well. Eventually, you will build critical mass as a community (the 100th Monkey principle) and this will take shape on its own. Vet carefully, vet thoroughly. Only the most aggressive trolls should ever be considered. Specifically, those who only - or primarily - make personal attacks for the sake of harassment: either the mean-spirited variety like SilentNick3, or the laughing mockery variety like CowzGoesMoo. I.e., repeat offenders (stalkers who lurk in their respective shadows).</p>

<hr/>

<p>If you don&#39;t like this idea, please explain why and offer suggestions for how it might be improved.</p>

<p>Are you going to accuse every new account of being me? If so, then I already won. I have you and FCD jumping at ghosts.</p>

<p>EDIT: After you deleted that AMA yesterday and walked away without responding to my last comment, I had hoped that you had maybe chosen to do some introspection, but you&#39;re still playing &quot;blame HGT for everything that&#39;s wrong with YOU&quot;, you sick fuck.</p>

<p>EDIT2: At the risk of tooting my own horn, I did point out SilentNick3&#39;s tactics and CowzGoesMoo&#39;s inability to use American idioms (publicly) just yesterday. Whoever wrote this post ^ is dead on target with who the biggest trolls are. Apparently whoever wrote this post is as tired as everyone else is with having them protected by the mods and retained as distractions.</p>

<p>EDIT3: I just noticed (when I logged in to respond here) that CowzGoesMoo had trolled me in that deleted thread, linked above, <em>after</em> it had been deleted. So, the OP has picked up on something I was not even aware of until just now. </p>

<p>p.s. Fuck you, sins. Fuck you and your pathetic &quot;I thought we were friends&quot; crybaby BS. You&#39;re a belligerent idiot climbing a social ladder to stroke your own ego. I&#39;d rather deal with the trolls than to read another one of your self-absorbed posts or comments.</p>

<p>The major trolls are jcm267, robotevil, voodoomurphy, TheGhostOfNoLibs, Herkimer, and WattMeter. </p>

<p>If you are concerned about anti-semitism then you probably need to check yourself.</p>

<p>Not agreeing with the actions of a country (Israel) is not the same as being against the religion of Judaism. </p>

<p>Thats like calling someone who isn&#39;t a fan of the USA an anti-christian. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a cop out to pull the anti-semite card. </p>

<p>Yes this subreddit legitimately doesn&#39;t like Israel, but how could they not? I mean, they do all sorts of crazy fucked up things all the time. </p>

<p>The latest is their deportation of Black people. </p>

<p>Edit: and I&#39;m no Israel fan. To pull my most recent complaint, the IDF held a line to prevent Syrians fleeing death and civil war from escaping. That&#39;s not the actions of a modern democracy concerned with protecting human life. The problem users here call out Jews. Just look up thread. &#39;Both these trolls are Jewish&#39;.

    <div class="md"><p>No one is saying all criticism of Israel is anti-semitism. I don&#39;t even care for the Israeli government and I support a two state solution, for example.</p>

<p>When posters such as bumblingmumbling suggest most Jews are Zionists, that is anti semitic. When it is suggested that 40,000 Jews were told not to go to work at the WTC on 9/11, that is anti semitic, since it suggests all Jews (or at least all NYC Jews) were complicit in the attacks on 9/11 and <em>wanted</em> it to happen. When some *<em>deny the existence of the Jewish ethnic group *</em>, that is anti semitic. </p>

<p>I worry about anti-semitism because, last time wild, anti-semitic accusations went unchecked, 6 million Jews died. And no, I don&#39;t want to get into the &quot;it wasn&#39;t six million&quot; debate with you (if you believe that, not saying you necessarily do) or anyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>... That proves nothing of an obsession with Jews here in r/conspiracy.</p>

<p>It more likely speaks to the fact that Zionism/Israel hence certain Jews are involved in various conspiracies like spying, political schemes, the dog shit media... etc. This is not rascism/bigotry. It is a point of fact that should be self evident to you by now. What your promoting is political bullshit.</p>

<p>More than a few of us here know that Israel and certain Jews commit unspeakable crimes. This is not to say we condemn all Jews everywhere.</p>

<p>Some Jews that I&#39;ve known are extremely charitable and generous. I know that they are not guilty of any crimes. I do not speak ill of them when I say fuck Israel. Fuck their nukes and and mother fuck their war drum. Nations are all bullshit. Israel is not superior to the rest of the M.E. Jews are not above criticism. They are not superior to anyone in any way. Neither are they inferior. Thus we here at r/cons observe their crimes as we do any other race/culture/nation/military. It&#39;s not an obsession with Jews, just their compounding crimes and corruption.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And again i&#39;ll state that proves nothing about r/conspiracy being obsessed with Jews. Israel is the Jewish state. Jews (not all) are apart of conspiracies. Israel, a country for Jews commits crimes. It&#39;s calling a spade a spade. If Zimbabwe  was up to the same shit we&#39;d call them on it too. But i don&#39;t see any citizens of Zimbabwe in the US gov or controlling the media. Some JEWS take part in far reaching conspiracies. Some don&#39;t. Some Jews speak out against Israel and it&#39;s apologists. But i digress. You have a point. Jew has become short hand for Israeli right wing likud government Jew and that is not right. I personally don&#39;t speak harsh of all Jews. But some deserve our collective condemnation and their actions deserve our attention. It&#39;s not our fault that these criminals just so happen to be Jewish.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really an excuse...besides, Hindu and Christian doctorines are based on Helping others and coexistence with other religions.  Certainly there are extremists from all Western religions that believe they are right and should convert others but not so vehemently as the Zionists.  And certainly not as protective of the pure bloodlines; most feel it&#39;s their duty to convert others, thus saving them.  Zionism decrees exclusion instead</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know Cowz all that well, but I certainly wouldn&#39;t call him a top troll. </p>

<p>The major trolls are jcm267, robotevil, voodoomurphy, TheGhostOfNoLibs, Herkimer, and WattMeter. </p>

<p>If you are concerned about anti-semitism then you probably need to check yourself.</p>

<p>Not agreeing with the actions of a country (Israel) is not the same as being against the religion of Judaism. </p>

<p>Thats like calling someone who isn&#39;t a fan of the USA an anti-christian. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a cop out to pull the anti-semite card. </p>

<p>Yes this subreddit legitimately doesn&#39;t like Israel, but how could they not? I mean, they do all sorts of crazy fucked up things all the time. </p>

<p>The latest is their deportation of Black people. </p>
