Obama&#39;s administration has been pulling away from Israel for a while now, based on their increasingly unstable policy toward Iran.  Suddenly, a bunch of Muslims attack 2 US embassies on 9/11 over a fucking video of Mohammed.</p>

<p>There are a lot of potential explanations here, I&#39;m asking for ideas that go beyond the standard datamining or confirmation bias that frequently marks this subreddit.</p>

<p>Edit: <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/12/opinion/benotman-libya-attack/index.html?hpt=hp_c1">Well that didn&#39;t take long</a>, looks like the charade isn&#39;t being bought by CNN at least.  The opinion expressed in this particular article is that the Libyan attack was meant to remove US support from Libya&#39;s fledgling government so extremists could exert more power.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Shore&#39;s documentary about radical Islam, Obsession, became a controversial part of the 2008 presidential campaign when he distributed copies of it to 28 million voters in U.S. swing states in an apparent attempt to convince them of the dangers of Islamic terror in the run-up to the election.[1] Shore has declined to reveal who funded both the production of the film or dissemination of the DVDs.[1]</p>

<p>And now we have yet another Israeli Zionist-Jewischbag producing another film that actually leads directly to the death of multiple Americans.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Innocence of Muslims</strong> is a 2012 religious and political film that allegedly triggered the September 11, 2012 storming of the United States Embassy in Cairo, Egypt, and a rocket attack on an embassy personnel car of the United States Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, resulting in at least four deaths of U.S. diplomatic personnel, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens.[2]</p>

<p>The independent film was produced and directed by Sam Bacile, a 56 year-old Israeli-American real estate developer. He identifies himself as an Israeli Jew.[2] According to Bacile, he produced the film to call attention to what he perceived were the &quot;hypocrisies&quot; of Islam.[3] According to Ynet, Bacile said he raised $5 million from about 100 Jewish donors, whom he declined to identify. Working with about 60 actors and 45 crew members, he said he made the two-hour movie in three months last year in California.</p>

<p>In the mid-1960s, <strong>actor Leonard Nimoy</strong>, who was raised in a traditional Jewish home, <strong>used a single-handed version of this gesture to create the Vulcan Hand Salute for his character, Spock, on Star Trek</strong>. He has explained that while attending Orthodox services as a child, he peeked from under his father&#39;s tallit and saw the gesture; many years later, when introducing the character of Mr. Spock, he and series creator Gene Roddenberry thought a physical component should accompany the verbal &quot;Live long and prosper&quot; greeting. The Jewish priestly gesture looked sufficiently alien and mysterious, and became part of Star Trek lore.[26] Nimoy later recorded an English translation of the blessing for Civilization IV; the recording is played when the player discovers the technology &quot;Priesthood&quot;.</p>

<p>The mysterious “Sam Bacile” supposedly spoke to The Associated Press, The Wall Street Journal and The Times of Israel, claiming to be a California real estate developer and an Israeli Jew who raised $5 million for the film from 100 other nameless Jewish donors.</p>

<p>The WSJ reported that he’s 52, but the AP placed his age at 56. Raw Story‘s own inquiries could not find a ”Sam Bacile” linked to any California court filing, which would be highly unusual for a real estate developer. He’s also missing from U.S. genealogy databases and the major social media networks.</p>

<p>The media has generally been portraying rebels as good and dictators as bad when the real situation is far more convoluted. This situation has made a lot of people realise actually we&#39;re helping out total maniacs, we&#39;ve toppled regimes that had some good aspects to put in fundamentalists crackpots. </p>

<p>Benghazi was the very city the west interveened to supposedly protect the lives of civilians and now they&#39;re killing ambassadors. </p>

<p>This may totally fuck up Obama&#39;s interventionist policy in the middle east because he won&#39;t be able to justify helping out poor, downtrodden democracy lovers because they&#39;re now perceived as ungrateful, barbaric fundamentalists. </p>

<p>Despite Gadaffi flaws which there were many he did do things that helped the public, Libya was the wealthiest country in Africa coming from complete poverty and I fear they&#39;ve deliberately put in people who will destroy it and return everyone to destitution.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know much about Assad apart from him allowing a great deal of freedom of religion which isn&#39;t the same in all middle eastern countries. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said Jews, you provocatuering asshole.</p>

<p>Your biased, collectivist assault on the Muslim faith, could just as readily, and be applied to the state of Israel.</p>

<p>Is that the offical line now, &quot;it&#39;s just free speech&quot;?  Do you really think people are that fucking clueless, that merely screaming &quot;free speech&quot; is going to instantly eliminate all culpability from the author, whom stated that he produced the film for the benefit of Israel, with the funding of 100 Jews, totalling $5,000,000?</p>

<p>You cry &quot;free speech&quot;, but does that make up for the loss of life?  If this was some sick, perverted way of &quot;proving&quot; that the entire Muslim faith doesn&#39;t believe in free speech, then not only has it failed miserably, but it cost the lives of 4 human beings in the process.  I honestly don&#39;t know which is worse; the obvious anwer that I&#39;ve suggested, or this elaborate, self righteous, selfish entrapment scheme you are proposing.</p>

<p>The latter scenario would be higly ironic, not to mention violently hypocrtical.  Considering Israel&#39;s history of passing &quot;hate crime&quot; legislation (most recently in California, but also Canada, and some European nations) and the almost incesant conflation of criticism of Zionism/Israel with antisemetism. One would think that an Israeli and those 100 Jews would not be so quick to sacrifice their only shield, for a blade.</p>

<p>I think Muslims are just like every one else, overwhelmingly they&#39;re good people, and just want to get through life and live in peace. But for whatever reason, there a lot of extremists in the Middle East that think murder is an acceptable response to an insult. </p>

<p>And yes, free speech is free speech. Controversial statements (or films in this case) need to be protected by free speech the most. There&#39;s no point if having freedom of speech if it only applies to popular opinions.  </p>

<p>And <strong>nothing</strong> justifies murdering another person, especially not &quot;someone made fun of my prophet&quot;. Nothing will ever excuse the &quot;protesters&quot; in Libya.  </p>

<p>I wish mate, I wish. I don&#39;t reckon every part of television should be educational, but I definitely think the majority of it could be. So much fluff on telly with so many watching and it&#39;s all conflicted, people yelling and screaming at each other. I was very lucky and had a British style education so the majority of the doccos I saw growing up were English and it really helps IMO. </p>

<p>When I was eight, they took us into the AV(audio/visual for anyone born after the 90&#39;s) and showed us &quot;Threads&quot; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MCbTvoNrAg">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MCbTvoNrAg</a> WTF, I mean I was eight, who has nukes and why do we have them? The Cold War-Bravo adults!! Started reading a lot after that.</p>

<p>The best thing about telly these days is that it&#39;s dying thanks to the Interwebs. A bummer there is just as much shit on here.</p>

<p>I understand the connection but I have not seen any evidence that this attack was committed by the MB as of yet. If you have some please post a link. I am only basing my opinion on what I have read about the incident, RPGs attacks on Embassies are not a hallmark of the MB as far as I know. I also do not see what the CIA would stand to gain by using their assets in this way. </p>

<p>Having read more today it seems to be becoming clear that is was a deliberate and orchestrated attack, which in itself implies their is some Agency or Organisation behind it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I can&#39;t say it was the MB, either.  Though, they were brought up in numerous articles as being behind it.  Whenever I hear the Muslim Brotherhood mentioned, I make it a point to ask people to question their legitimacy and ties to extragovernmental agencies.</p>

<p>The thing is, an RPG was fired by an anonymous member of the crowd gathered around the consulate.  This leaves much speculation as to who is responsible, though the MSM already seems so sure, with so little evidence.</p>

<p>Sadly, we&#39;ve already got warships headed to Libya, as if we haven&#39;t done enough to its people already.  Its all a part of the long con.  Our government wants to engage in another illegal war alongside Israel, all of this nonesense about wanting to avoid a war with Iran or any conflict in the Middle East is just theater.  </p>

<p>Libya has been on the short list for some time, they just need to throw the base population into another bloodrage in order to gain its acceptance, which is becoming increasing easy to do.</p>

<p>The Mittani, leader of the Goonswarm, and former Washington lawyer has even said in his article about this <a href="http://themittani.com/news/rip-vile-rat">here</a> that he knows something is fishy about the whole thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m really the best to extrapolate on this subject, but I&#39;ve definitely been thinking about it a lot today what with recent events and all.</p>

<p>I used to play EVE quite a bit, off and on since 2008. I was on one of my on periods and was a member of the CFC (Cluster Fuck Coalition), which is easily the largest entity in the Eve world, and the one that Goonswarm heads up. Vile Rat was an integral part of Goonswarm, acting as a top level diplomat (among other things, he was very famous for doing a lot for the Goonswarm alliance, and serving on the Council of Stellar Management, the player group that has regular access to the developers, he was quite the legend in game). I mean no disrespect here, but being &quot;just&quot; an IT guy IRL, it seems somewhat poetic he perished with an ambassador, seeing as how that&#39;s what he was known as being in EVE (and a damn good one, too).</p>

<p>What has got me really interested is The Mittani&#39;s comments in the article I linked to, which I&#39;ll quote here;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Obviously, given the combined attacks in Egypt and in Libya, this was a coordinated act designed for maximum media exposure; rile up a mob, point them at an embassy or consulate on 9/11 in particular, aim for the press. Many were injured in these pointless, reprehensible acts, and one of my closest friends was killed as a result.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, The Mittani is very Internet famous, at least in EVE community, which has significant ties to Reddit, Something Awful, and 4chan (among others). In fact, I actually learned of Reddit from EVE, so... maybe my perspective is skewed.</p>

<p>In any case, The Mattani has at his disposal at least 2,000 Internet savvy computer nerds who are willing to follow his lead on pretty much anything. These aren&#39;t just neckbeards chilling in their mom&#39;s basement, either. They are highly skilled professionals (I know he&#39;s got at least one stock broker, who has been responsible for some amazingly awesome market manipulation schemes perpetrated by Goonswarm).</p>

<p>I made the comment about taking over the Internet because when he was running for a spot on the CSM this past election period (which he won by a HUGE landslide), The Mittani talked about how if you have a significant portion of people willing to follow you, you can literally take over the Internet for a day or two, because he and Goonswarm did that for one reason or another. It had something to do with their crazy schemes.</p>

<p>In any case, knowing he has the power to do something like this, and being a former Washington lawyer, it looks like he suspects something fishy.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#39;ve got to run out to dinner really quick, but if people are interested, I&#39;ll add more when I get back.</p>

<p>I really hope he plans on acting on this.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right now, it would tremendously help his election prospects. His perceived lack of total fealty to Israel was a huge embarrassment at the DNC. There are a variety of loud voices advocating for Israel in the US (right-wing Israelies, Neocons, Evangelical Christians) and almost no popular media suggesting otherwise, so it hurts him to even act reasonably even-handed towards the situation. As to whether he would actually support Israel after they started a war... my guess is that politically, he&#39;d have no choice. But at least he&#39;s on record as being against it.</p>

<p>Obama has proven in Syria, Libya, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen etc he&#39;s by no means adverse to military intervention so why would he suddenly gain a conscience over Iran?

    <div class="md"><p>Of course the DNC is mostly more sympathetic to the Palestinians (though still, as we saw, unbelievably pro-Israel). But the American public is overwhelmingly not with them on that one. Obama needs to win over independents, who in general support Israel and have not a lot of knowledge about the situation in general. Dems and lefties are not going to choose anyone else at this point, don&#39;t be absurd. They&#39;re already going with Obama, but he needs every single independent vote he can get to win in the swing states. Most of those independent voters hear pro-Israeli spin, if they even hear anything. So yeah, any perceived anti-Israel move on his part is a political liability.</p>

<p>Obama is no enemy of military intervention, but he IS smart enough to know that the public in general is against it, at least in Iran&#39;s case. Still, I suspect the right-wing propaganda machines would be up and running before the first bomb fell, pushing very, very hard for him to intervene on behalf of Israel in any confrontation. </p>

<p>So we have to make the distinction between pro-israel and pro-bombing iran. Judging by <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/153092/americans-continue-tilt-pro-israel.aspx">this poll</a> most people support Israel as you say but what proportion of democrats and independents would want to bomb Iran? Would Obama blatantly backing Netanyahu dissuade any of them especially independents enough to cost him the election?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny because I was just talking to somebody about the muslim brotherhood. I&#39;ll just copy and past.</p>

<p>The biggest target of the west has always been the Arab League, which has done wonders to civilize and modernize member Arab nations beyond the cliched image of Jihadists and poor goat herders. Things like literacy programs, advancing women&#39;s rights, and child welfare and education were just a few ways the Arabs had attempted to get themselves out of the third world along with China and some of eastern europe. But the west had put the kibosh on this when, through mostly Saudi agents, we revived the Jihadist and Muslim movements. At that time, they fought the soviets, now they fight progress in the area through factions like the Muslim Brotherhood, who overturn years of cultural and societal advancement to return to shariah law and ignorance. And these angry young arabs full of contempt for the west? They beg to join the ranks of Al-Qaeda, Al-Aqsa MB, and Hamas to throw away their lives. Not many arabs have seen through this, the exceptions find themselves targeted by the west, including Saddam, Ghaddafi, al-Assad, and the Iranians, leaders who were able to build an infrastructure, educate a population, and present a real threat of organization and consolidation in the region. If you can turn the arabs into fundamentalist, born-again muslims, you can degrade and distract them even further with sectarian conflicts and the rejection of ungodly things like western science and a full work force of both men and women. Plus it feeds right into the American caricature of &quot;evil terrorists.&quot; If you listen carefully you can hear the war drums getting louder again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This happened on 9/11. Mitt Romney + Jewish zionists = true love. Romney down in the polls. I think a good conspiracy theory here is that Romney himself had something to do with it to make Obama look bad (?) close to the election, on 9/11, a day when everyone is feeling patriotic. Psychological warfare by the Romney campaign against the American public still deeply pained by the attacks by Muslim extremists 11 years ago. Bankrolling an extremist group in an unstable country would be pretty easy, especially if most of your money is already in offshore banks where money laundering frequently occurs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay so, after sleeping I came back to actually look through the articles (hahaha... evidence... yeah...)</p>

<p><strong>Libya</strong></p>

<p>Looks like RT reports this: &quot;Libyan officials alleged that Islamist militants fired rockets at Steven&#39;s car, killing him and three other embassy staffers. Witnesses cited by local media claimed that members of the hardline Islamist group Ansar Al-Sharia were among the ranks of the attackers.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The outbreak of violence is part of global Islamic outrage against the American amateur film &#39;Innocence of Muslims,&#39; which was deemed offensive to the Prophet Muhammad. Similar attacks took place at the US embassy in Cairo, Egypt.&quot;</p>

<p>In their article is no evidence (through translations or other sources) of the connection between Ansar Al-Sharia and the film.  It could be conjecture, it could also just be that they suck at reporting and didn&#39;t include it.</p>

<p><strong>Egypt</strong></p>

<p>As for the attack in Egypt, there are quotes available.  Huffington post reports:</p>

<p>&quot;In place of the U.S. flag, the protesters tried to raise a black flag with the words &quot;There is no God but Allah and Mohammad is his messenger&quot;, a Reuters reporter said.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&quot;This movie must be banned immediately and an apology should be made ... This is a disgrace,&quot; said 19-year-old, Ismail Mahmoud, a member of the so-called &quot;ultras&quot; soccer supporters who played a big role in the uprising that brought down Hosni Mubarak last year.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;One slogan scrawled on the walls of the embassy, a fortress-like structure that is near Tahrir Square where Egyptians revolted against Mubarak, said: &quot;If your freedom of speech has no limits, may you accept our freedom of action.&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>Not saying my 5 minutes of googling amounts to much research, but it looks like the Egypt case has a very clear connection to the film.  I haven&#39;t seen hard evidence that the Libyan case is connected though (again, 5 minutes of googling, I&#39;m not concluding anything here)</p>

Yes, I find the re-dubbing most interesting as-well. I have analysed the audio with some audio forensics tools and can definitely conclude that the audio is modified. This film is not specifically inflammatory of Islam, it has been modified to be so. Now, here is the really interesting question, did the original uploader Sam Bacile, dub the video or just upload it. Who did the audio modifications and what is the background behind the original footage. Interestingly all those audio changes would be lost in the translation.</p>
