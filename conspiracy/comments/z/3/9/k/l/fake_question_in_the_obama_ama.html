        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m not sure if this has been brought up before, but I found one question in the Obama AMA very suspect. User &quot;hmlee&quot; submitted a question about how he was graduating grad school and there were no jobs, etc. Obama replied with a 300 word piece straight from his campaign about how much he&#39;s doing/done to create jobs. </p>

<p>My main concern with this are a few things:</p>

<p>1) User &quot;hmlee&quot; was created moments before the question was asked.
2) The user&#39;s story is strikingly similar to political stereotyping. They might as well have led off with &quot;I&#39;m an 18-24 male who is concerned about the economy&quot;.
3) The tone used is in no way Redditesque.
4) Finally, the closing comment/question is VERY slanted call to action: </p>

<p>&quot;What can I say to encourage those in similar situations as I am to show up again in November? What hope can you offer us for your second term?&quot;</p>

<p>I fully believe user &quot;hmlee&quot; is a campaign staffer.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What were the terms that President Obama was given the username PresidentObama when it was already an active account. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090221153248/http://www.reddit.com/user/PresidentObama">http://web.archive.org/web/20090221153248/http://www.reddit.com/user/PresidentObama</a></p></li>
<li><p>Why was access restricted to only this post when I was allowed to log in everywhere else? I was only able to view the post after logging out.</p></li>
<li><p>Why were some of the more provocative questions deleted when it was an AMA?</p></li>
<li><p>Why was President Obama sitting at his laptop accepted as proof when it could have been and most likely was a staffer answering questions?</p></li>
<li><p>Were there any guidelines or restrictions that President Obama requested in order to do the AmA?</p></li>

<p>This might have a perfectly innocent reason, as the rapidly changing comments page probably wreaks havoc on reddit&#39;s caching and the logged out version may be easier to cache than the individual logged in version.</p>
