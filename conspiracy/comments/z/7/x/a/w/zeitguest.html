    <div class="md"><p>i&#39;m saying that regardless of what anyone says, i know what&#39;s right. i know that limiting our use of resources (and our population) is the right thing to do. we simply can&#39;t let our population keep growing like it is. we can&#39;t keep deforesting and raising the global temperature, year after year. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>oh my god, you are missing the point, THEY are not marxists, they want to be the authoritarians that oversee the slaves.  the slaves being us.  Which is what you are advocating.  Your concept of &quot;saving the earth&quot; is more like &quot;saving the earth for the extremely rich&quot; and impoverishing everyone else.  You &quot;know&quot; what is right because you have been brainwashed by the school systems, who spout the same shit the media spouts about how humans are the problem and there needs to be less of them all while they have massive families and are hoarding all of the land and the resources for themselves.

    <div class="md"><p>i am advocating us being slaves. i want us to charge through the cities, turning all upscale apartments into free homeless shelters, and institute a 100% idle wealth tax, because that&#39;s what slaves do.</p>

<p>i want to do everything to the rich short of burying the burnt corpses of the parasite class in a shallow mass grave, and that means i advocate for the rich continuing to be in charge.</p>

<p>i think you might be the one missing the point.</p>

<p>just because osama bin laden liked baklava, does not mean baklava is evil.</p>

<p>the rich want a less polluted planet and less population, because those are objectively good goals. i agree with these goals, because they are objectively good.</p>

<p>i&#39;ll just repeat this once more since you never addressed it. using renewable resources and practicing responsible family planning are genuinely good ideas, that need to happen one way or the other.</p>

<p>i can&#39;t speak for the intentions of anyone at the UN, but these goals and letting the rich stay in charge, are two completely separate issues that you wish i would agree to conflate, so you can accuse me of something evil. rich people can rot, we need to stop breeding. two separate issues.</p>

The amount of propaganda that has been deeply imbedded into your psyche and your belief structure is obscene.  Family Planning? like eugenics.  good idea.

    <div class="md"><p>LOL, one man subreddit, that shit JUST STARTED.  I don&#39;t know how I am a person with an authoritarian mindset when FREEDOM is the goal.  You are advocating forced life changes by people who &quot;know better&quot; and who are &quot;experts&quot; because you have been conditioned to worship and suck the dick of anyone who claims to be an &quot;Expert&quot; on something.  I don&#39;t do that.  See, I know how to question.  In the process of questioning you can find blatant inconsistencies.  See the New World Order found a way to trick you idiots into WANTING it.  They teach you that the world is going to end if the New World Order is not implemented, so you become the New World Order&#39;s #1 advocate.  It really is simple.  But you are completely blind to it.  Go over to <a href="/r/climateskeptics">/r/climateskeptics</a> and try to spout this bullshit to them that&#39;s more than a &quot;one man&quot; subreddit, I can assure you.  You&#39;ve been indoctrinated into the cult of science.  that is really what it is.  Real science is a constantly CHANGING and EVOLVING thing, not &quot;OKAY 51% OF US SCIENTISTS(who are funded by the Dept of Education or similar gov&#39;t agency[<sup>that</sup> <sup>signed</sup> <sup>the</sup> <sup>Agenda</sup> <sup>21</sup> <sup>treaty</sup> ) THINK THE WORLD IS WARMING BECAUSE OF PEOPLE SO THAT IS TRUTH&quot;</p>

<p>That 98% are just counted at a specific survey which .77% of the scientists interviewed had the 98% consensus. 77 out of 10,000 were considered. The poll also had a 30% turn-out which is very low. There is no way this can accurately be used to say that there is an consensus. It is impossible to be part of the IPCC if you deny anthropogenic climate change. That’s why its a consensus. Also, that survey fails to include meteorologists, geologists, physicts, chemists, biologists, and many earth science scientists. If we would take their count too, it would be 45% accept, 48% deny and 7% unsure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>wikipedia?</p>

<p>I skipped that whole bullshit wiki and went down to the sources and sure enough:  IPCC, a bunch of &quot;sustainability&quot; minded websites, and a ton of NGOs who PROFIT PROFIT PROFIT, from the global warming bullshit.  It is the Agenda 21 implementation program all laid out nice and neat.  </p>

<p>the IPCC is the UN: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change</a></p>

<p>So of COURSE their bullshit is going to side with what the UN plans.  They are going to fund the studies that support their agenda.  That is how it works.  It is so simple.  People are ALWAYS using the IPCC as the &quot;expert&quot; opinion. When the IPCC won&#39;t even publish documents that are contrary to its agenda.  Because the UN has an agenda, its called Agenda 21.  You just keep spouting the UN bullshit dude.  It&#39;s SO BLATANTLY OBVIOUS that this is the world domination program being implemented, but you must want that.  You must LOVE the idea of being enslaved by unelected technocrats.  You worship &quot;experts.&quot;  There are &quot;experts&quot; on both sides.  So all you are doing is choosing a group of &quot;Experts&quot; to worship.  The climate is going to change buddy, it&#39;s not us doing it.  It&#39;s just the way it is.  </p>

<p>Even if it was getting warmer by 1 degree every century like these monkeys claim, what the hell difference will that make?  The ice caps will take hundreds and hundreds of years to melt they are miles thick, they melt a little every year and then freeze right back up again.  The weather is constantly changing, the earth is constantly changing.  Trying to STOP it from changing is ridiculous.  You need to realize, that this is a TRICK to get you to hand over your individual sovereignty to the UN and become a fucking slave to their system.  IT IS the NWO.  They are genius with this plan, because they have all the supposedly &quot;Educated&quot; people on board.  But education is just indoctrination.  You have an &quot;expert&quot; who tells you what is right and what is wrong, if you question it, YOU FAIL! that is how the education system works.  I went to college for 3 years, I saw how the system works... They don&#39;t want thinkers, they want OBEDIENT WORKERS! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And that is really the best explanation you can come up with? I mean, I see what you are saying and I do agree with it to an extent and don&#39;t get me wrong, I do enjoy watching the occasional conspiracy related youtube documentary every now and then but for every solid one there are easily 20 shitty ones. And if you don&#39;t agree with that then you might be believing too much. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will try to explain it simple.</p>

<p>There are 2 type of systems. Linear and nonlinear</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linearity">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linearity</a></p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_system">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_system</a></p>

<p>linear system would have beginning and the end. And road through the system would be linear (scripted in advance).</p>

<p>In nonlinera system there is chaos and butterfly effect. In that type of system there is no certainty in advance for final end result of the system.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect</a>
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hrV9xt50Vc">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hrV9xt50Vc</a></p>

<p>Now, to try and explain it differently:</p>

<p>The road to hell is paved with good intentions </p>

<p>which means:</p>

<p><em>The meaning of the phrase is that individuals may do bad things even though they intend the results to be good. One example is the introduction of alien species such as the Asian carp, which may become a nuisance due to unexpected proliferation and behaviour.</em></p>

<p>We are living in nonlinear system with unexpected results. You can make perfect society with robots and everything can end up in matrix type of situation or terminator type of situation. </p>

<p>You are making assumptions in advance for actions that would take artificial intelligence. You can not foresee what actions would artificial intelligence take after it is self aware. </p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity</a></p>

<p><em>The technological singularity is the hypothetical future emergence of greater-than-human superintelligence through technological means.[1] Since the capabilities of such intelligence would be difficult for an unaided human mind to comprehend, the occurrence of a technological singularity is seen as an intellectual event horizon, beyond which events cannot be predicted or understood.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.exohuman.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/neuron-galaxy.jpg">http://www.exohuman.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/neuron-galaxy.jpg</a></p>

<p>And we have probably crossed singularity</p>

<p>Do you understand or would you like some more you tube videos ? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>bad things having happened from good intentions does not automatically mean that good intentions will always result in bad outcomes. if P then Q, it does not necessarily follow that if Q, then P.</p>

<p>not being able to 100% predict the future does not mean that terminators are an equally likely outcome if our goals and resource allocation goes toward peaceful purposes. you might as well try pascal&#39;s wager on me, see how that works.</p>

<p>nearly all of the things i propose can happen without sapient artificial intelligence. stop assuming things you can&#39;t predict.</p>

<p>i don&#39;t think we have reached the singularity, and neither do most AI scientists. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>you ARE the people with the authoritarian mindset. you&#39;re willing to kill the planet just to be the last one on it. </p>

<p>and guess what, all those grandkids are gonna fucking hate you for it.</p>

<p>is the planet infinitely large? can we fit an unlimited number of people on it comfortably? to me, simple math says no. but math is probably some kind of brainwashing too huh? you don&#39;t understand math, i can tell by your response. family planning? that means NAZIS!!!1! ZOMG!</p>
