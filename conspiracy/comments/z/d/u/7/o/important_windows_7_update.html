        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I turn my PC on not too long ago to see I have updates that need to be installed.</p>

<p>I see what the updates are, and it says 1 Important update: Skype 5.10 for Windows.</p>

<p>I thought to myself: I don&#39;t use Skype, why is this an important update??</p>

<p>I recall a little while back Microsoft buying Skype, or Microsoft doing something weird with Skype.</p>

<p>And after a quick search here, I find <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/search?q=skype&amp;restrict_sr=on">these</a>.</p>

<p>I find it very strange that Microsoft has decided this is an IMPORTANT software that needs to be installed, rather than something optional. </p>

<p>This is exactly why I don&#39;t allow updates to install automatically...</p>

<p>Did anyone notice this? Am I just being overly cautious?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is r/conspiracy, friend.  You really think writing off all these bizarre Windows updates as &quot;accidents&quot; will quell our paranoid/inquisitive minds?

    <div class="md"><p>Actually I do and I knew about the flub update as it happened.

<p>My question to you though is what kind of security risk do you believe this presents?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Honestly, I don&#39;t know.  Do any of us know if there are backdoors in Windows/OSX?  I don&#39;t.  Given the megacorporation-biggovernment relationship these days, I wouldn&#39;t put it past them to have inserted spying abilities.  </p>

<p>The <strong>only</strong> reason to use OSX or Windows is because of the applications that run solely on those platforms.  If you can make due with open office etc, then go to Linux.  There is nothing special about OS GUI&#39;s anymore.  If you try Ubuntu/Mint/etc you&#39;ll find their interfaces to be slick, professional, easy-to-use, etc.  As I said, the bottom line is application compatibility.</p>

<p>Ask yourself: in this day and age, why is my operating system not opensource?  This is basic computer functionality.  It is old and done.  There is no OS-specific reason to choose a closed source OS anymore, apart from a few edge cases.</p>

<p>I need OS X for audio production. Linux and windows both fail miserably when put up to this task mostly due to audio latency when using a live monitor. Also I am not sure sure about your experience in this field.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed, I produce music myself and use an unconnected Windows box for the task.  While Linux does suck for audio production, it is still usable, but is really missing the apps.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>NO operating system can send network traffic though a firewall unless you allow it to do so.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a pretty bold statement.  The OS could do so if it wished, and hide it from a software firewall (not hardware).  Not saying it happens, but it could.  Besides, there are many other ways to sneak by you from an OS perspective.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am absolutely sure that OS X can be every bit as secure as any linux machine out there. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure.  Unplug them both.  ;)  Anyways, it&#39;s not just about security.  There are bigger reasons to use an open-source OS.</p>
