<p>EDIT: Again, I just want short, quick points to share with people tomorrow. If people ask for sources, I will deliver them. People tend not to pay attention to long, wordy opinions. Also, NOT providing sources will cause people to maybe Google for themselves. Which is ideally what I&#39;d want them to do: FIND OUT FOR THEMSELVES.</p>

<p>EDIT#2: A lot of my sources are from the ones you&#39;ve posted below. Some of them come from here: <a href="http://rigorousintuition.blogspot.com/2004/08/coincidence-theorists-guide-to-911.html">http://rigorousintuition.blogspot.com/2004/08/coincidence-theorists-guide-to-911.html</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Osama bin Laden was NEVER officially a &quot;wanted&quot; criminal for the 9/11 attacks. </li>
<li>7 of the 19 hijackers were found alive post 9/11. They were never on the planes.</li>
<li>A passport of one of the hijackers was found in near-perfect condition in the rubble of the twin towers. That hijacker was then found alive in the middle east, surprised to hear his passport was found.</li>
<li>Both WTC buildings and WTC 7 collapsed in a &quot;free fall&quot; which coincides to destruction from controlled demolition. </li>
<li>In 1975, an extremely hot fire at the World Trade Center burned for 3 hours over 9 floors. &quot;It was like fighting a flame thrower&quot; said one fire fighter. Fire was at or exceeded the temperature of the fire on 9/11. No floor collapse.</li>
<li>Active Thermitic material (used to cut through metal) was discovered in dust from the World Trade Center collapse. 9 physicists published their findings in a peer-reviewed Physics Journal.</li>
<li>118 on-site firefighters gave testimony to hearing or seeing multiple explosions before each tower collapsed.</li>
<li>1,500 architectural and engineering professionals have called for an independent investigation into the collapse of the World Trade Center towers.</li>
<li>WTC 7 was hit on the south side from burning debris from WTC 2. However, a large fire soon erupted on the north side of WTC 7, on floors 12 and 13... the 2 floors which housed offices of the SEC and thousands of documents investigating Wall Street companies such as Enron.</li>
<li>In 1997, the PNAC - Project for the New American Century (headed by Dick Cheney among others) said that convincing American citizens to support their policies would be difficult unless &quot;some catastrophic catalyzing event – like a new Pearl Harbor&quot; occurred. </li>
<li>On Sept 10, 2001 $2.3trillion is reported to be &quot;missing&quot; from Pentagon accounts. The next day, Sept 11, the Pentagon accounting office gets struck, all records are lost.</li>
<li>Rabbi Dov Zakheim, Pentagon Comptroller responsible for the missing $2.3 trillion, dual US/Israeli citizen, PNAC document signer, former CEO of SPC, manufacturer of aircraft fly-by-wire systems</li>
<li>It took 411 days before the government&#39;s official investigation began. And they appointed Henry Kissinger to head the investigation. A man with direct ties to the Bin Laden family.</li>
<li>The Bush Administration had received 20 warnings of an imminent attack from 14 foreign intelligence agencies and did nothing.</li>
<li>Flight 77, which reportedly hit the Pentagon, flew off course back towards Washington D.C. for 40 minutes without being detected by the FAA&#39;s radar or the even superior radar possessed by the US military.</li>
<li>Not a single person has been fired, penalized, or reprimanded for incompetence, misjudgement, or failure to respond on 9/11.</li>
<li>Sibel Edmonds, a former FBI translator who claims to have knowledge of advance warnings, was publicly silenced with a gag order requested by Attorney General John Ashcroft and granted by a Bush-appointed judge</li>
<li>George W. Bush&#39;s brother Marvin sat on the board of the Kuwaiti-owned company which provided electronic security to the World Trade Center, Dulles Airport and United Airlines.</li>
<li>Live BBC News coverage reported WTC 7 had collapsed... 23 minutes before it actually happened.</li>
<li>Michael Springman, State Department veteran of the visa bureau, has testified that the CIA ran his office and issued visas to Al Qaeda members so they could receive training in the United States.</li>
<li>Boston tech company Ptech, founded by a Saudi financier, was placed on America’s Terrorist List in October 2001. The 2 years leading up to 9/11, Ptech had access to the FAA’s entire computer system.</li>
<li>The military protocol for shooting down hijacked aircraft was altered on June 1, 2001, taking discretion away from field commanders and placing it solely in the hands of the Secretary of Defense. After 9/11, this protocol changed back to its previous status.</li>
<li>Attorney General John Ashcroft stopped flying on commercial airplanes in July 2001. </li>
<li>Hani Hanjour, the supposed pilot of Flight 77, could not fly a small Cessna plane in August, but in September managed to fly a 757 at excessive speed into a spiraling, 270-degree descent and a level impact of the first floor of the Pentagon</li>
<li>Able Danger, a classified military planning effort led by the U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), identified 2 of the 9/11 cells, including ringleader Mohammed Atta. One office tried to warn the FBI of the terror cells in 2000, but the meeting was blocked by the Department of Defense.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>You almost have to thank them for that. We know that if there were sinister parties involved on our side, those people would not have been touched. They would have had to fire a bunch of scapegoats, effectively sending however many people they wanted away from their jobs believing that they played and integral part in all of those deaths that occured on 9/11. It would be a merciful flaw in the cover up, I&#39;d say.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure if this assertion is correct: &quot;Thousands of scientists and physicists have done discovered the existence of demolition materials in the rubble of the world trade centers.&quot;</p>

<p>More questions:</p>

<p>Why did the head of the CIA, and other high level US officials, have breakfast meetings on 9/11 with the guy who allegedly paid the hijackers?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/jul/22/usa.september11">http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/jul/22/usa.september11</a></p>

<p>Why weren&#39;t fighter jets scrambled as they are normally for hijackings, etc.?</p>

<p><a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/planes/analysis/norad/">http://911research.wtc7.net/planes/analysis/norad/</a></p>

<p>I would say that it&#39;s helpful to put source links for any assertions. Ideally the source is a mainstream news outlet as folks will be more likely to trust the info (although some stuff is ignored by the mainstream so there&#39;s no way to do that).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ABLE DANGER - a DIA data mining operation from 1999 - 2001 which identified 2 of the 9/11 cells, including ringleader Mohammed Atta. One office tried to warn the FBI of the terror cells in 2000, but the meeting was blocked by DoD officials. After numerous whistleblowers came out in 2005, the DoD smeared those individuals and revoked their security clearances. Over 1 TB of data was destroyed by the DoD, files sent to the 9/11 Commission were &quot;lost&quot; and other documents kept by the whistleblowers went &quot;missing.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>WASHINGTON, Aug. 16 - A military intelligence team repeatedly contacted the F.B.I. in 2000 to warn about the existence of an American-based terrorist cell that included the ringleader of the Sept. 11 attacks, according to a veteran Army intelligence officer who said he had now decided to risk his career by discussing the information publicly.
The officer, Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer, said military lawyers later blocked the team from sharing any of its information with the bureau.</p>

<p>Also, these tactics have been in use for thousands of years, ever since sun tzu&#39;s art of war. It&#39;s kind of funny that they unclassified this conspiracy that never went through, which proves that a previous suspicion of a conspiracy was true. This alone in northwoods is worth gold. The fact that history repeats itself and the use of sun tzu&#39;s art of war is no mere coincidence either.</p>

<p>BBC reporting on the collapse of WTC Building 7 over twenty minutes before it fell at 5:20pm in the afternoon of 9/11. The incredible footage shows BBC reporter Jane Standley talking about the collapse of the Salomon Brothers Building while it remains standing in the live shot behind her head. How did the BBC know that it was going to collapse? And why did they report the collapse when it is clearly standing in the background?</p>

<p>Make it appealing to the greater mass and make it easy to read. Easy so even a child would understand. Add color and time-frames in a pedagogical way. This list can go viral if it is presented in the right way. Think like the company to outsmart the company.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, and then post it everywhere. </p>

<p>Done right, people will share it and it will spread on it&#39;s own. And then, maybe, if enough people knows of this list (it becomes common knowledge) then it must be true. And if it must be true then there must be consequences. But first, the list must change the common view of 9/11, it must change to a situation that people feel dumb for believing it was an Al-Qaeda and Osama bin Laden planned attack. When a former &quot;fact&quot; is made as &quot;old news&quot; or a &quot;trick for kids lie&quot; then people has a tendency to step back from that statement and look for what others think to fit in. To not be called an idiot. This phenomenon is called &quot;a movement&quot;.</p>

<p>All of us who seeks the truth in things must represent the truth as for what it is for those who doesn&#39;t seek it or even denies it. Mass-media made the lies &quot;cool&quot; and this is what we all should do. As I wrote before, we must think like the company in any aspect. Who are your friends, what do you work with, who do you know, what are you good at? Think of all this things and implement the truth in everything, if you live the truth, speak the truth and believe the truth, people will listen. 
All big speakers had one thing in common whatever agenda, they all spoke about their business as they really believed it, like it was the core of everything. They could talk about anything and people believed it, they spoke with such passion and authority that everyone knew that this is it, this is real.</p>

<p>I&#39;m rambling, I&#39;m sorry. But I believe that there are a lot of intelligent people out there who knows a lot of stuff but just not know how to share it in a way that the common man would listen to. We all need to speak about things like this like it was show business. Present the truth like it&#39;s the greatest show in the world.
Amuse people, make them feel dumb for not laughing at the lies.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s all i have to say about that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to casually debunk these. I will note where I cannot. Here we go. My debunkings have ** before them.</p>

<p><em>Osama bin Laden was NEVER officially a &quot;wanted&quot; criminal for the 9/11 attacks. *</em>He wasn&#39;t on the most wanted list. Big deal. Why would the FBI leave a clue to his supposed innocence by not bothering to put him on the list? This theory posits that the government was competent enough to carry out the attacks but dumb enough not to publicly charge him. Simpler explanation: They didn&#39;t put him on the list because his guilt was taken as a given.
<em>7 of the 19 hijackers were found alive post 9/11. They were never on the planes.</em>* People with the same names were found alive, leading to confusion. That&#39;s all. Where is the evidence that they weren&#39;t on the planes? They were seen at airport gates. Unsupported claim.
<em>A passport of one of the hijackers was found in near-perfect condition in the rubble of the twin towers. That hijacker was then found alive in the middle east, surprised to hear his passport was found.</em><em>A passport was discovered on the ground. It survived the fires. Big deal. Lots of items did, and it was found because it was an intact item among the debris. The person in the middle east had the same name. Big deal.
*Active Thermitic material (used to cut through metal) was discovered in dust from the World Trade Center collapse. 9 physicists published their findings in a peer-reviewed Physics Journal.</em><em>Nope. The Thermite material that Truther physicists refer to is iron and other debris from the buildings. No peer review study was ever done by any reputable journal. Sorry, no and no.
*1,500 architectural and engineering professionals have called for an independent investigation into the collapse of the World Trade Center towers.</em><em>So? There have to be at least 1,500 people calling for an investigation into vampires. Both groups are wrong.
*On Sept 10, 2001 $2.3trillion is reported to be &quot;missing&quot; from Pentagon accounts. The next day, Sept 11, the Pentagon accounting office gets struck, all records are lost.</em><em>Nope. The records were NOT all destroyed. Do you think the Pentagon would keep all their records in one building, let alone one database? You&#39;re right that the Pentagon &quot;lost&quot; a ton of money. This means it was stolen, wasted, spent on crony contractors and black ops. No link to 911 here, move along...
*It took 411 days before the government&#39;s official investigation began. And they appointed Henry Kissinger to head the investigation. A man with direct ties to the Bin Laden family.</em><em>Again, you&#39;re arguing that they were smart enough to orchestrate the attacks but dumb enough not to cover it up from people with internet access. 411 days for a government investigation? Sounds about right. And Kissinger has ties to everyone. He&#39;s a war criminal. He&#39;s powerful. No conspiracy here.
*The Bush Administration had received 20 warnings of an imminent attack from 14 foreign intelligence agencies and did nothing.</em><em>Yes, they did receive warnings. They did not conspire to ignore them. They simply did. Because they were corrupt and incompetent. No mystery here.
*Flight 77, which reportedly hit the Pentagon, flew off course back towards Washington D.C. for 40 minutes without being detected by the FAA&#39;s radar or the even superior radar possessed by the US military.
Not a single person has been fired, penalized, or reprimanded for incompetence, misjudgement, or failure to respond on 9/11.</em><em>So you&#39;re positive nobody you maybe haven&#39;t heard of lost their jobs? Dubious claim at best. As for Flight&#39;s 77 uninterrupted flight...so? The common Truther idea that it should have been intercepted immediately is simply not reality. Sorry, planes go off course. All. The. Time.
*Sibel Edmonds, a former FBI translator who claims to have knowledge of advance warnings, was publicly silenced with a gag order requested by Attorney General John Ashcroft and granted by a Bush-appointed judge</em><em>Has anything she&#39;s claimed been confirmed by anyone? So she was gagged. She knew classified material. Advanced warnings? How general were they? Anyone confirm this? Or maybe she was a former government employee who proved politically inconvenient? Happens all the time. She&#39;s hot, though.
*George W. Bush&#39;s brother Marvin sat on the board of the Kuwaiti-owned company which provided electronic security to the World Trade Center, Dulles Airport and United Airlines.</em><em>Wait, so you&#39;re implying that W. called up his own brother had told him to F up the security because the Bush administration was gonna attack the buildings he provided security for? That&#39;s. Insane.
*Live BBC News coverage reported WTC 7 had collapsed... 23 minutes before it actually happened.</em><em>There is no way of knowing the circumstances around the broadcast, including when it was recorded and what erroneous information they were working on. They were wrong. Big deal. 
*Michael Springman, State Department veteran of the visa bureau, has testified that the CIA ran his office and issued visas to Al Qaeda members so they could receive training in the United States.</em><em>So? Al Qaeda were intelligence assets from way back in the 70s. Our government tends to train and fund their assets.
*In 1997, the Project for the New American Century (headed by Dick Cheney among others) said that convincing American citizens to support their policies would be difficult unless &quot;some catastrophic catalyzing event – like a new Pearl Harbor&quot; occurred.</em><em>Sigh. PNAC wanted a new Star Wars system and all kinds of crazy shit that they never even tried to get after the attacks. Are you suggesting they carried out the attacks and then failed to capitalize on them to advance their stated goals? Read PNAC. Nothing they called for was implemented. Nothing.
*Boston tech company Ptech, founded by a Saudi financier, was placed on America’s Terrorist List in October 2001. The 2 years leading up to 9/11, Ptech had access to the FAA’s entire computer system.</em><em>Confirm this. Please. That&#39;s ridiculous.
*The military protocol for shooting down hijacked aircraft was altered on June 1, 2001, taking discretion away from field commanders and placing it solely in the hands of the Secretary of Defense. After 9/11, this protocol changed back to its previous status.</em><em>So the protocol was changed, the new protocol failed horrible and then was quickly reversed? Thank goodness.
*Attorney General John Ashcroft stopped flying on commercial airplanes in July 2001.</em><em>So what? He started flying private. So. What?
*Hani Hanjour, the supposed pilot of Flight 77, could not fly a small Cessna plane in August, but in September managed to fly a 767 at excessive speed into a spiraling, 270-degree descent and a level impact of the first floor of the Pentagon</em>*Yes. Yes he certainly did.</p>

    <div class="md"><ul>
<li>&gt;Why would the FBI leave a clue to his supposed innocence by not bothering to put him on the list? This theory posits that the government was competent enough to carry out the attacks but dumb enough not to publicly charge him. Simpler explanation: They didn&#39;t put him on the list because his guilt was taken as a given.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>You are coming up with your own theories which no one here has stated, also known as a strawman argument. We are establishing a FACT that the FBI does not list 9/11 under bin Laden&#39;s supposed crimes. It is our job to find facts and then ask pertinent questions, which is what we are doing. Your &quot;simplest&quot; explanation is one that best appeases your conscience and. If his guilt is so self evident, then why would they not list it? And, if his other crimes are just as self evident, then why are they on the list at all?</em></p>

<ul>
<li>&gt;A passport of one of the hijackers was found in near-perfect condition in the rubble of the twin towers. That hijacker was then found alive in the middle east, surprised to hear his passport was found. A passport was discovered on the ground. It survived the fires. Big deal. Lots of items did, and it was found because it was an intact item among the debris. The person in the middle east had the same name. Big deal.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>I would love to see your &quot;lots of items&quot; made of similar material to a passport that survived a giant kerosene fireball, then the amount of energy it took to <a href="http://www.scientistsfor911truth.org/introduction/wtc_debris_field.jpg">eject giant steel beam 100&#39;s of feet horizontally</a> and embed into nearby buildings and the energy to <a href="http://newsmine.org/content.php?ol=9-11/wtc-collapse/over-750-bone-fragments-found-on-deutsche-bank-building.txt">crush bones into tiny pieces</a> and throw them a few hundred feet. This magical passport is always used as sound evidence when the government&#39;s version of events is outlined, so it must be a big deal.</em></p>

<p><em><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1559151.stm">Here is the BBC article</a> that you should read about alleged hijackers still being alive. It is more than a case of having the same name. They also have identical pictures, passports and some of them even went to flight school inside the United States!</em></p>

<ul>
<li>&gt;So you&#39;re positive nobody you maybe haven&#39;t heard of lost their jobs? Dubious claim at best. As for Flight&#39;s 77 uninterrupted flight...so? The common Truther idea that it should have been intercepted immediately is simply not reality. Sorry, planes go off course. All. The. Time. </li>
</ul>

<p><em>If the claim is so dubious then it should be incredibly easy to find an example to counter, yet you provide none. In fact, I have a <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/21047/Dont-Question-Whether-They-Deserved-Them-or-Not">report confirmed by the GAO</a> that multiple people at the State Department got $15,000 cash bonuses for &quot;outstanding performance&quot; after they allowed Visa&#39;s of multiple alleged 9/11 hijackers which would have normally been denied. Here are <a href="http://old.nationalreview.com/mowbray/mowbray100902.asp">6 more Visa&#39;s</a> of alleged 9/11 hijackers, which you can download, that should have also been denied but were not. Can you think of any good questions to ask yet?</em></p>

<ul>
<li>&gt;Wait, so you&#39;re implying that W. called up his own brother had told him to F up the security because the Bush administration was gonna attack the buildings he provided security for? That&#39;s. Insane.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>You are again coming up with your own theory to debunk. We are trying to collate facts so we can ask pertinent questions. It is an established fact that Marvin Bush was a director of Securacom from 1993 - 2000 and they admittedly held a security contract for the WTC complex which ended on 9/11/01. It is something that should be investigated further.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>&gt;There is no way of knowing the circumstances around the broadcast, including when it was recorded and what erroneous information they were working on. They were wrong. Big deal.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Actually there is. You can ask questions of people who were there. Or you can ask a simple question to yourself, such as: how can they report a building falling down 23 minutes before it happens when it is featured prominently in the backround as the women is announcing it? It is actually quite simple. The same reason why <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Guezljq4ys">CNN also</a> reported it before it collapsed. They were reading from the same news wire.</em></p>

<p><em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3khAzuiEMo">A Fox News affiliate also bizarrely reported WTC7&#39;s collapse prematurely</a> by 41 seconds while the building was clearly standing in the picture. As it falls live on air they calmly report that it has collapsed again and do not comment how odd it is to report the collapse of the same building twice within 40 seconds.</em></p>

<p><em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzMlFFQ2oqQ">Here you can listen to Phil Hayton of the BBC</a> being &quot;sure&quot; he wasn&#39;t in the studio on 9/11 when asked about WTC7, then after they point out they have a video, he suddenly remembers being there.</em></p>

<p><em>BBC&#39;s official explanation is that since it was reported that firefighters were worried about WTC7 collapsing they then reported it as it DID collapse, which is strange because even in NIST&#39;s report they say that WTC7 is the first known modern steel skyscraper to fall primarily due to fire damage.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>&gt;So? Al Qaeda were intelligence assets from way back in the 70s. Our government tends to train and fund their assets.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Al Qaeda did not officially exist until the 1990&#39;s and were considered heroes by the US for their role in the Serbian conflict and again considered heroes in the recent Libyan conflict and also are heroes in the current Syrian conflict. What proof do you have that they were not our assets in the intervening period?</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Calm down, its going to be okay.</p>

<p>People did die. That&#39;s the point. People here just want the truth which led to those deaths.</p>

<p>Opposed to what you are doing? Insulting internet strangers and probably not doing anything for the betterment of society? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done. on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil, Amen</p>

<p>I can&#39;t imagine a worse fate for someone than having no soul, no hope and only hate and anger in their heart and their future. I prayed to Jesus for you and I hope God can heal your brokenness. If it&#39;s any consolation I think I know a little of what you feel, but I refuse to turn away from my faith. </p>

<p>If you believe only maggots await you after death it&#39;s very hard to reconcile this life. This world is not the end. We have a soul that does carry on. And that is the hope that can save you from destruction. God bless you</p>
