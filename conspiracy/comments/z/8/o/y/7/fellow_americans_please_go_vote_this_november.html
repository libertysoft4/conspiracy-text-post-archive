    <div class="md"><p>Well yes, if you have a larger fire than the one you want to extinguish you can do that.  However, I would point out that while your attempt to insult my understanding of business and war might make you think you know more, what you are saying does not add up. </p>

<p>Contextually, that is what the (NWO) or a world government is.  A larger version that will extinguish national sovereignty.  I assure you when talking distributing power I do not a larger form of this beast.  </p>

<p>My point is that you must remove the fuel to extinguish it.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cheers. </p>

<p>Their control goes as far as we (the supposedly controlled) are willing to do their work for them.  </p>

<p>This is why I advocate non labor. Sitting out.  Forfeiting. </p>

<p>They do not actually control people.  People willfully join them and offer their mind, bodies and essentially souls to the &quot;job creators&quot; as if they are deities.   This paradigm has run a muck.  We do not need job creators, we need food and shelter.  We don&#39;t even need healthcare, we will get sick and better and sick and better and then one day we will all die. The people who are sicker earlier and more frequently will die sooner.  </p>

<p>Fucking instead, we have Dick Cheany. This asshole is so fucking sick and disgusting that he appoints himself VP while heading the committee to select a VP.  Takes control of the military on the morning of 9/11.  Hires his own company to  privatize war and the infrastructure to support it. .... and today is walking this earth with a machine running his heart.  </p>

<p>Meanwhile the cost of healthcare is up to like 5x more expensive than any other nation and NOW is time to nationalize healthcare?  FUCK HEALTHCARE.  They kill more people than any other industry.  Currently the opiate epidemic in this country is sickening.  Medicare Prescription drug coverage and a monopoly on opium in Afghanistan is manifesting itself in children dying from overdoses, more people checking into rehab for opiates than alcohol.  The way out that is offered is through chemicals that are more addictive than the original addiction to a mild opiate.  Not only that, but shamanistic drugs like DMT, Ibgoaine, Mushrooms, LSD etc, that can be used to induce a spiritual experience helpful in recovering from &quot;states of possession&quot; like a crippling drug addiction are illegal and heavily prosecuted.  </p>

<p>Poor people don&#39;t have fake hearts, rich powerful scumbags do.  We do not need the kind of healthcare that we are being taxed for now. </p>

<p>WTF is happening and why are people raving about freedom? </p>

<p>Sorry to rant in your thread man, I am allowing my thoughts to flow out freely on purpose so I can get them later for some other writing things I am working on.  I appreciate the opportunity to engage in dialogue about these things. </p>

<p>Obama, judging by past actions, mostly does not let the <em>insane</em> Israeli Likud government push him about (very much).</p>

<p>Mittens, on the other hand, has already promised the Zionists a war and, indeed, <em>they have already paid him for it</em> in the form of millions of dollars of campaign contributions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not what the long run means though..</p>

<p>Voting third party might open people&#39;s eyes to new candidates, new parties, new everything...in the long run.</p>

<p>This movement is something that needs to happen now as it could take decades to fix, but needs to be about doing something bigger than us and bigger than right now.</p>

<p>I have read the post and all I see is someone saying that you should vote  Obama because you can&#39;t trust Romney without ever giving any bit of proof.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can see how you may have read my comment in that context and I&#39;m sorry for any misunderstanding it may have provoked. as well i do plan on reading through through some of the comments as well has the many hyperlinks that have been posted. It is my belief that there are to many people in this country who vote with the crowd before ever looking up any bit of information on who they are voting for that is why I posted this comment not to argue or to even disagree with your beliefs but simply in the hope that someone will see and research these things for themselves the way you obviously have, and for that I applaud you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes; it&#39;s clear from the last 4 years that <em>lesser-evil</em> is not also part of that conspiracy. Because of the republicans, a full presidential term wasn&#39;t enough time for any hope or change at all; but I&#39;m certain another 4 would give him the time he needs to make the slightest effort to do anything but continue and expand the policies of his <em>greater-evil</em> predecessor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man, you are very close.  But you have to know that people believe big lies.  The lies are so big they are unbelievable.  </p>

<p>It would be a blessing if it were only congress, only senate, only executive, only judicial, but once you start to look really really closely, you too will see it is the whole damn lot that is lying.  Every congressman, every president, every supreme court justice etc is a member of one society or another.  The news is predetermined based on the agreements between these small groups. </p>

<p>The mainstream media will never ever mention these groups, but will mention things that allow you to connect dots.  This is not intentional, it is because they are arrogant and think you are too stupid to realize when John Roberts goes to Malta after the affordable care act ruling, that its not a vacation but an obligation he has to the Knights of the Maltese Cross.  I bet he got to wear a funny hat and had a new funny title like &quot;supreme ultra master of grand poobahs in the realm of fairie justice&quot; once he got there. </p>

<p>I used to think people like me were batshit crazy, some of them are. Supporting slave masters and the agendas of societies that you do not get to participate in is way more batshit crazy than getting a few secrets wrong in an attempt to tell the truth from the lies of a bunch of weirdos.  </p>

<p>The whole damn thing is fucking weird.  Mirak Obamney is not going to help you.  Any movement that tries to rise and play in their game of control will be co-opted or destroyed.  Tea Party: Co-opted, OWS: Co-opted. All the people who will not be co-opted in the movement will be labeled terrorists and destroyed.   </p>

<p>If you fight for anything, fight any concept of crushing dissent.  Protest anytime you see a 10:1 police to protestor ratio like in Tampa. </p>

<p>You cannot co-opt the system with a 3rd party, but if you give up the right to dissent against any leader, ruler, or government you give up any hope of one day being able to establish freedom as a system and will gradually lose the freedom to opt out as I have. </p>
