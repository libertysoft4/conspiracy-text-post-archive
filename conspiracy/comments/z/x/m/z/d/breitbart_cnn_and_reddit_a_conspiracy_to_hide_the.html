        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Why are people in the Middle East angry at America?  Is it:</p>

<p>1) Because they&#39;re so ignorant, they think youtube videos and cartoons are a good reason to burn buildings, or</p>

<p>2) Because Americans are so ignorant, we refuse to see all the myriad ways our aggressive foreign policy is crippling their countries?</p>

<p>Which sounds more likely?</p>

<p>On reddit now, we have a front-page article in <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> asking why Muslims are so touchy and violent (Washington Post).  There&#39;s a Brietbart article on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> suggesting that THEY are just nasty people and we are too lenient with them.</p>

<p>The media spin that this is all about a movie is bullshit, from Hillary and Obama and Time-Warner on down.</p>

<p>This is about US (and Western) foreign policy.  About decades of treating their societies as obstacles to commodity profits.  Drone strikes, military intervention, and covert operations to raise or topple governments.</p>

<p>I would be angry too.</p>

<p>As an American (or Westerner), the least I can do is look beyond the government/industry-sponsored bullshit and say, &quot;No, they&#39;re NOT stupid and touchy.  I would be angry too if I was treated the way we treat them.&quot;</p>

<p>We can&#39;t stop the media from spreading bullshit for the wealthy sociopaths.  But we can refuse to play along.</p>

<p>EXACTLY.  I&#39;m really upset about this because there&#39;s a tone in the media lately like, &quot;Aren&#39;t these people a bunch of stupid animals, to get so upset about a little cartoon or movie?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right. It may be naive to say that all of the current violence is solely a reaction to the film, but it is equally naive to think that Muslims are a tolerant people who are simply protesting American foreign policy. I think the truth lies somewhere in between: elements interested in disrupting American interests in the region have used the film to incite protests as a smokescreen. I think there are currently covert operations involved on both sides. Reminds me of the tit-for-tat events surrounding Operation Wrath of God. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>On a level above perceived zionist plotting, it&#39;s the fact that the citizens of the Middle East are predominantly kept poor despite having a majority of the world&#39;s oil and gas, with most of the wealth going to the leaders of those countries, their cronies, and Western businesses. </p>

<p>Many governments in that part of the world have either been put there by the US (Iraq, Afghanistan) or are US-backed puppets, both in terms of military aid and support as well as an implicit blessing to continue their secular dictatorships, such as Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt under Mubarak (public pressure became too large for the US to continue supporting Mubarak, although they attempted to still back the Yemeni dictator Saleh before he was driven out of the country). </p>

<p>This has created a citizenship that see secular and corrupt regimes backed up by a foreign power that go against the Islamic way of life and belief (Church and state being separate is an alien concept to many poor, uneducated and/or devout Muslims). To take the Saudis as an example, they hold sharia law and very strict Islamic &#39;code of conduct&#39; over their own population, yet they themselves live in luxury hotels in London, with blackjack, and hookers.</p>

<p>This mentality is expounded with a radical version of Islam being spread around the Middle East by madrassas paid for by the Saudis. Religion plays a role, but is not the most fundamental problem, rather US intervention in the region and their negative effects on the majority of the population there. </p>

<p>This film, much like the Danish cartoons and other such events, are merely ulterior triggers for a deep-seated resentment, distrust and dislike. American intervention in that region is hated further due to their uncompromising support for the state of Israel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What the two of you are saying are not mutually exclusive.  Perhaps only under the reign of an extremely dehumanizing foreign policy would their be years of consistent attacks on something so many Americans take so seriously, their religion.  At the same time, the Islamic world may be less willing to be so self destructive at these attacks if their was not already a fundamental problem they have with Americans in general.  It would appear to some of us that the islamic world is not set into a fit of rage over these videos, but rather they are living in a fit of rage with Americans and it is only when we decide to add insult to what they(and many of us) perceive as continued injury, that an actual physical manifestation of that rage emerges. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Both Muslims and Americans are lied to by their leaders and media. They&#39;re taught to fear each other and it propels some to power. A lot of the angst is typical anti-imperialism and should be expected in the Middle East, which was colonized though much of the 20th century. After the European withdrawal from the Middle East after WW2, the US took a huge role. Through the Cold War, theUS and Societs jockeyed for support and tried to puppet the regimes. Much like the Chavez types in South America, there&#39;s a lot of legitimate disdain for America in the Middle East. There is also lots of disinformation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read it.  And your talking point won&#39;t work, unless you can bury the issue with bullshit.  (But hey, so far that approach is working... but how embarrassing to be caught shoveling the shit.)</p>

<p>Let&#39;s just look at how the spin works in the first few paragraphs.</p>

<p>The title -&gt; the Arab world is inferior because it is too easily offended.</p>

<p>First paragraph -&gt; Westerners are modern and superior because we tolerate offenses (except flag-burning, of course... our military history is like their religion)</p>

<p>Second paragraph -&gt; Western criticism is benign, but these thin-skinned people just get their panties in a twist.  Silly people.</p>

<p>Third paragraph -&gt; Well OF COURSE they&#39;re touchy!  They&#39;re so far inferior (far from &quot;greatness&quot;) that they hate themselves and everybody else.</p>

<p>And so on.</p>

<p>It a steaming load of racist bullshit.</p>

<p>On edit:  and check out the top (socially-engineered?) comment:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also because there&#39;s a plethora of unemployed, uneducated and unmarried men with nothing better to do than violently &quot;protest&quot; whenever their delicate ego feels slighted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They&#39;re angry because they&#39;re so inferior!  And they have an inferiority complex!  That&#39;s the real problem.  Never mind that we&#39;re bombing their kids and financing the overthrow of their governments and taking all the profits from their natural resources.  Why would that even be worth mentioning?</p>
