        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The Guardian is reporting that the anti-Islamic film that sparked the outrage and protests in front of the American embassy in Egypt, and it&#39;s consulate in Libya, was made by <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/13/anti-islamic-film-us-nakoula?CMP=twt_fd&amp;CMP=SOCxx2I2">Nakoula Basseley Nakoula</a>, 55, who lives outside Los Angles, and holds the career of fraudster and criminal. </p>

<p>CNN is also now reporting that the attack against the consulate was <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/12/world/africa/libya-attack-jihadists/index.html">pre-planned by some  &quot;pro-Al-Qaeda group&quot;</a>, and that the insurgents used the protest as a diversion for the attack (the protest was likely planned sometime in advance for such a huge crowd on the anniversary of 9/11, and the video likely just added fuel to the protest fire). </p>

<p>The Obama Administration&#39;s response to this attack which left a US Ambassador, and three US service-men dead is to dispatch <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/12/us-libya-ambassador-marines-idUSBRE88B0UD20120912">Marines to Benghazi</a>, and <a href="http://www.newsday.com/news/nation/us-officials-say-2-warships-moving-toward-libya-1.3997175">put war ships off the Libyan coast</a></p>

<p>Could this have been a potential false-flag attack in order to establish a semi-permanent US Military presence in Libya with troops on the ground, or am I stupid for thinking this?</p>

<p>Tl:Dr - I think the protests and attack against the embassy in Cairo and Benghazi were orchestrated by US intelligence or special forces in order to create the pretext for placing troops on the ground in Libya and establishing a semi-occupation (or at least insure the contingency of the US-friendly government that is in power now). Am I stupid for thinking this?   </p>

<p>The thing that I am most concerned with is the film. Instead of an American planned false flag, it may be an Israeli planned one in order to force America&#39;s hand into eventually attacking the Iranian nuclear sites.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We already know that they train terrorists from cradle to the grave, most of those guys probably believed in that Mohamed shit, but who LED THEM?!</p>

<p>People need to start looking at who led these people, who got away, one was wearing a press pass (One of the &quot;Anonymous Prophet&quot; guys) I&#39;m sure other witnesses saw different things that just doesn&#39;t add up.</p>

<p>Who was that old guy excusing the behavior when it was all happening? Was he acting on panic to get away from the murderous mob? <strong>Or</strong> An agent or contact?</p>

<p>I mistrust everything I&#39;m fed to by the media, so we need to look at facts and screwups, maybe this was a bunch of fucking idiots dooming their country, but past incidences and connections are just too obvious in this case.</p>

<p>Are we seriously going to accept this whole bullshit funded anti Mohammed movie?

<p>Or something you get when you don&#39;t care about the quality of the film.  If you aren&#39;t creating the film for entertainment purposes, then who cares if it&#39;s good?  If all it has to do is insult Mohammed, that can be done quite quickly, cheaply, and easily.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not 100% convinced that this is what happened, but I&#39;m definitely acknowledging the possibility.  It seems suspicious to me, and the media isn&#39;t really known for telling the truth about what really happens and why.</p>

They want a war with Iran now, but any sane politician wouldn&#39;t make waves leading up to election day. What happens after we tell Netanyahu to shut up and wait? &quot;Al Qaeda&quot; tries to hit Dempsey on a plane out, Netanyahu&#39;s scientist friend publishes an <a href="http://mobile.wnd.com/2012/09/israeli-science-website-obama-birth-certificate-forged/">article</a> stating Obama&#39;s birth cert is fake, and now &quot;Al-Qaeda&quot; elements are involved with this protest.

    <div class="md"><p>The destabilization of Libya, sectarian violence and an the demand for an increased military presence in the region was universally predicted by voices of the antiwar movement. The only suprising thing is, that it took this long for it to happen. It is typical US foreign policy:</p>

<p><em>&quot;We mustn&#39;t allow those fundamentalistic Islamists [we helped yesterday] to control the region, therefore our benevolent guiding hand is needed. Without US presence no security.&quot;</em></p>

<p>For me the whole story seems to be obvious disinformation. But I have no idea who was really behind this anti-Islam crap, and if the promotion of this crap was planned in context with the murderous attack. Con men like Nakoula are often employed by intelligence agencies to play their dirty games. </p>

<p>I think it will be quite telling if this Mr Nakoula Basseley will be arrested and questioned, or if he will be allowed to go free. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I posted this in <a href="/r/Askreddit">/r/Askreddit</a>, so I&#39;ll ad here:</p>

<p>His youtube account: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4DjVszAn4GAyzgsjtkJONg">http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4DjVszAn4GAyzgsjtkJONg</a>
His only video &quot;favorited&quot; is a video from the Alnour Party, a radical, pro-sharia law political party in Egypt: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Nour_Party">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Nour_Party</a></p>

<p>His only video under &quot;likes&quot; is a video about a woman who converted to Islam, hosted by an Islamic TV channel, see here: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kx-Xq2KB5g8&amp;amp;feature=plcp">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kx-Xq2KB5g8&amp;amp;feature=plcp</a></p>

<p>He has been described by sources as Arab, including the actors/film crew who he tricked into making the movie. Of course, there are Arab Christians, and many of them are quite fundamentalist, but I&#39;m just adding to his profile here.</p>

<p>Also of note, there used to be three separate videos on his profile, all different versions of the same movie trailer. Now there are only two listed, and curiously, the one deleted listed a phone number:             866-967-7948      . This phone number traces to a house, which is also listed as a business (&quot;The Worry Club&quot;, <a href="http://www.theworryclub.com">www.theworryclub.com</a>) located in Peoria, AZ (you can look up the address if you want, but I&#39;m not posting it here to comply with reddit rules). Not sure where that fits in here, but it was interesting nontheless, particularly since that business seems to be very... sketchy.</p>

<p>So, is it possible that this guy could be a Muslim extremist, and the purpose of the film was to create a false-flag with the intention of spurring hatred towards the West/America?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Incredibly fucking possible in my opinion. My thoughts on the matter are that western governments did not get the type of government and concessions they had hoped for after the revolution in Libya. The west had made deals with the Islamist rebel leaders that they would help them on condition western corporations could have access to Libya&#39;s oil. </p>

<p>Unfortunately for the West, the radical Islamists have considerably less influence and power than they had anticipated. This is because the Libyan government is still decentralized (and incredibly Socialist) despite efforts by the NTC to create a more unified government based on strict Sharia Law. This decentralization of government is the result of the system of direct democracy (Jamahiriya) instituted by Gaddafi. This system gave the people of Libya a great deal of control and power which resulted in prosperity for many. This obviously means that they are very hesitant to give up that power and control because they are used to governing themselves already. As a result the US figures maybe a stronger presence might be required to &#39;put down&#39; the resistance, the &#39;pro Gaddafi militants, the hardliners&#39;.</p>

<p>Which brings us to the thought and questions you have raised. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Front page of reddit&#39;s favorite, Fox News reveals that it was some Israeli guy who doesn&#39;t exist who duped actors and is now responsible for sparking unrest in the middle east. The whole thing SCREAMS false flag setup.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2012/09/13/innocence-muslims-producer-identity-questioned-actors-say-were-duped/">http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2012/09/13/innocence-muslims-producer-identity-questioned-actors-say-were-duped/</a></p>

<p>read the first two paragraphs:</p>

<p>The man who identified himself as the filmmaker behind the anti-Islam film “The Innocence of Muslims” may have used a pseudonym and spent time in federal prison. Meanwhile several actors in the movie say they were duped, and are now distancing themselves from the film that was cited as a spark to the violence in Libya that resulted in the murder of the United States’ ambassador to that country.</p>

<p>Initial reports stated an Israeli-born producer who identified himself as Sam Bacile had gone into hiding following the violence in Libya. FoxNews.com’s research on public and private databases, business filings, and people finding services came up empty on that name. Israeli authorities also claim to have no records of him being a citizen, although he said in interviews to be both a citizen of America and Israel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh, it&#39;s possible, but I think it&#39;s unlikely.</p>

<p>Marines are tasked with guarding embassies across the globe. I&#39;m a former Marine myself and considered going to Marine Security Guard School if I decided to stay in.</p>

<p>While it&#39;s possible, I feel like this is a normal response. Something similar happened when embassies in Africa were hit by suicide bombers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not a crazy theory, but I seriously doubt this is a false flag orchestrated by our own intelligence community. There are many other means by which an occupation of Libya could have been achieved (including the initial &#39;revolution&#39; itself), all without such a convoluted narrative as a muslim extremist reaction to a controversial youtube video ending in the murder of foreign service officers. </p>

<p>Conspiratorial thinking will obviously lead us to conclude that any shitstorm like this is somehow part of an underlying agenda, but this is far more likely to be a series of bad decisions made by idealistic young jihadists who feel free to do as they wish after toppling their respective regimes. The Marine CT teams are very small, I wouldnt consider this a road to an occupation by any means whatsoever. </p>

<p>But yes, we do have a strategic interest in the region so we will obviously respond accordingly. So far, I&#39;m actually impressed at our level-headedness in dealing with this situation. Only time will tell what&#39;s to come, though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting, what do they gain by these actions though? At least in terms of American &quot;political-interests&quot; I can see troops on the ground to help stabilize Libya as being kinda a priority to US foreign-policy, and these attacks have kinda put that process on that fast tracks, what would Saudi Arabia or Pakistan gain from the attacks if they committed them?</p>
