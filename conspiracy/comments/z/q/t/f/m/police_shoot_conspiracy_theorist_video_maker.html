The guy made videos saying the government was a bunch of thieves and that the cops in his area are controlled by free masons. For some reason the cops took his video equipment. And when they met for him to get his equipment back the cops shot him for possessing a gun.  <a href="http://www.kmov.com/news/local/Trooper-shoots-suspect-in-St-Clair-169355616.html">http://www.kmov.com/news/local/Trooper-shoots-suspect-in-St-Clair-169355616.html</a></p>

<p>And here is what I am pretty sure is the guy&#39;s website. <a href="http://bulletinman.com/">http://bulletinman.com/</a>
Wow check out the web site he talks about all this and says&quot; If anything should happen to me....&quot; And was going through court proceeding against the state and troopers..WoW</p>

<p>What do you guys think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>his petition comes across as extremely paranoid (and possibly rightly so).  i don&#39;t see it as too far a stretch to think a man this worried for his life at the hands of the police wouldn&#39;t come armed to an arranged meeting, however stupid that may be. </p>

<p>of course we may never know if he actually was armed or not, or posed a threat to police officers. his demeanor in this petition would make me pretty wary of being anywhere around him with a firearm.  </p>

<p>theres a plausible explanation... and theres also a plausible motive for conspiracy... i dunno. </p>

 Assault is just when someone gets the cops involved afterwards. 
I was in a bar where this drunk punched me in the mouth out of the blue for no reason, no words spoken, didn&#39;t even know him. I reacted. Some people like to push till you react.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Before I respond I want to make certain we agree on the definition of the term:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/assault">Assault</a>: a violent physical or verbal attack.</p>

<ul>
<li>Have I been in a fight? Yes. </li>
<li>Was I the attacker? No.</li>

<p>And in the example you gave, you were assaulted. The drunk who punched you was your assailant. Not the other way around.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The DSM is a comprehensive manual covering the entire range of human emotion. There&#39;s quite literally a treatment for everything. You need to learn that &quot;mental illness&quot; isn&#39;t a real powerword that automatically discredits someone. </p>
