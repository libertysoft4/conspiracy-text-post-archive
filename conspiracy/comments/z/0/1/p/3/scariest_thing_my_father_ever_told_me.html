        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was raised in a small southern town, by parents with small southern town beliefs and principles. Religious, Conservative, Jeff Foxworthy type people. I was always a bit more open-minded, and when I went off into the world to attend a University, I learned. I&#39;m not saying I was dumb or sheltered, I just flat out was asleep to what was actually, or could actually be going on. The very idea that everything (or at least a large portion of everything) we know is a lie.  Discovering the truths of 9/11, the Bilderbergs, and the reasons behind the financial crisis we are in, along with the possibilities of the Illuminati, HAARP, chemtrails and the like were eye-opening to say the least. When I first started learning about conspiracies, the Illuminati were the first thing I was CONVINCED were true. I have many doubts now, but that&#39;s another topic.  Upon returning home for a holiday, I was excited about everything I had learned. I sat down and decided to bore my dad to tears babbling about some stuff I thought I knew. After talking for what seemed like 45 minutes or more, I finished telling him my theories on the Illuminati, Free-Masonry, brainwashing media and I&#39;m sure I rambled about satanism in music. He listened the whole time without interrupting.  I asked him what he thought, and he just leaned forward and looked at me and said, &quot;I know&quot;.  And he was not fucking with me. </p>

Sure I can understand that a lot of it we&#39;re powerless to affect, but we should still be aware of it. It&#39;s like we&#39;re all in a zoo and we don&#39;t want to recognize that everything around us is fake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>probably not the oldest, but a good one.  </p>

<p>I have read several books about the music industry circa 1969 and at that point in order to be even signed to a label you had to be in with the gays.  Not trying to be a bigot here, just stating facts.  I just read David Bowie&#39;s ex-wife&#39;s autobio and she talked about all of the famous people that were around and how they were either gay or had to suck dick to get signed.  People like Elton John, Jagger, Bowie, etc.  and that a good portion of them had done satanic rituals as well.  There is a notable story: <a href="http://chillystories.com/Bowie.htm">Here is the excerpt from the book right here, can&#39;t believe I found it</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Today&#39;s rap seems more government sponsored than the rap of 20 years ago.  In the 90&#39;s, rappers were rapping about oppression, today rappers are rapping about having millions, and pissing away those millions on self-indulgence.</p>

<p>Their audience identifies with this (sort of how lower-class identifies with rich Republicans).  They hear tales of rags to riches and believe if they continue to work their shitty jobs, maybe someday they&#39;ll catch a break and collect their millions as well.  Little do they know that our world is ran by family corporations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I was pretty new to all of this, I believed a lot of what I read without doing further research. For a while I bought into the satanic influences of music, hip-hop all the way back to the blues. Presently I have concluded that most of that is bogus, but music is very open to interpretation and VERY influential.  The hushed whispers of a rap Illuminati are enough to boost sales of records and merchandise that cash in on the dark themes.  But I highly doubt Jay-Z is part of some global satanic conspiracy to usher in the Antichrist. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I grew up in a very religious household, and remember watching a religious TV show, where they were demonizing popular music. They played a bunch of different lyrics. Including Alice in Chains, and the line :</p>

<p>&quot;Jesus Christ, deny your maker.&quot; </p>

<p>And used this as evidence of how satanic Alice in Chains was.</p>

<p>When I was older I heard the whole song. The next lyrics were :</p>

<p>&quot;He who tries, will be wasted&quot;</p>

<p>I knew right then, who the real deceivers and manipulators were.
I dont know if there is a god or not, but i do know one thing, the bible? Jesus? the Koran? The Torah? They&#39;re all fucking bullshit. The oldest, most profitable and least scrutinized conspiracy of all time is religion.</p>

<p>Patently wrong.  Why do they have levels if there are no secrets?  What is their handshake?  Why is Albert Pike of great importance to them?</p>

<p>Wrong again, secrecy breeds conspiracy which at very least, is illegal for anyone in a position of power.</p>

Freemasonry originally was a way for people of high stature to interact with regular people on the level. Then a lot of business men joined and when that happened politicians joined because they saw people that could help them further their goals. Symbolism is in the eye of the beholder and will always be, I see what I want just like you do. Free masonry is dead in america its basically a social club now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A degree is basically a play that the candidate is put through. We have a book that outlines what to say and has stage directions. We do everything from memory so we practice together to do it well. Each degree is meant to teach the candidate a moral lesson of some sort. Like the first degree is to teach you that you shouldn&#39;t value a person based on their worldly wealth and status but on their character and actions alone.</p>

If you can not truly realize this, you are simply ignorant of what is in plain site, or you are a shill.</p>
