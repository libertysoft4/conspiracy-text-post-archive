<p>Second, the username President Obama was taken from someone else and given to him. What were the terms of this? How was this organized? <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090221153248/http://www.reddit.com/user/PresidentObama">Here is the username from 2009</a></p>

<p>Third, one of the top questions and one of the few to be answered is from user <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/hmlee">hmlee</a> and goes </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am recent law school graduate. Despite graduating from a top school, I find myself unemployed with a large student loan debt burden.... etc</p>
</blockquote>

<p>hmlee has been a redditor for 1 hour.</p>

<p>I&#39;m having trouble accessing other users that received answers but that may be reddit crashing.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> I made a post asking the Mods of r/IAmA to explain some of these things and the post was removed without any clarification.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2</strong> Please go upvote this thread that requests the Mods and Admins to answer a few questions and falls within the guidelines.</p>
